**Read the Douay-Rheims Bible from your terminal.**

`73 Books · Vulgate Order · 3 Commentaries · Public Domain`

A command-line tool for reading the Douay-Rheims Bible (Challoner revision) — the classic English translation of the Latin Vulgate, with all 73 books of the Catholic canon including the deuterocanonical books.

Includes the **Haydock Catholic Bible Commentary** (full Bible, 35,000+ entries) with Cornelius à Lapide and 1609 Douai annotations coming soon.

Inspired by [Luke Smith's kjv](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/kjv). Built for Catholics who live in the terminal.

## Quick Start

```
$ drb John 1:1-5
John
1:1     In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God: and the Word
        was God.
1:2     The same was in the beginning with God.
1:3     All things were made by him: and without him was made nothing that was
        made.
1:4     In him was life: and the life was the light of men.
1:5     And the light shineth in darkness: and the darkness did not comprehend
        it.

## Commentary Sources

| Source | Coverage | Entries |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Haydock** (Rev. George Leo Haydock, 1859) | Full Bible | 35,000+ |
| **Cornelius à Lapide** (English NT) | Gospels, Epistles | 2,400+ |
| **1609 Douai Annotations** | Partial (original Douai notes) | 3,100+ |

Currently `-c` displays the Haydock commentary. Lapide and Douai 1609 support is in progress.

All commentary texts are public domain (pre-1928).

## ⚠️ Psalm Numbering

The Douay-Rheims follows **Vulgate/Septuagint numbering**, which differs from the Hebrew numbering in most Protestant Bibles. For example, "The Lord is my shepherd" (Protestant Psalm 23) is:

```
$ drb Psalms 22
```

Run `drb -l` to see all 73 books with their abbreviations.
