THE  H$fy  Gtsfcl  tf  feats  Christ,  mavrUmg  * £ Lttit,  that  is, 
the  Holy  Evangelical  History  of  the  words  and  acts  of 
Jesus,  as  described  by  S.  Luke.  The  Arabic  says,  “In  the 
name  of  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  one  God,  the  Gospel 
of  the  Excellent  Father,  Lake  the  Evangelist,  the  laying  open  of  die 
glorious  GospeL”  The  Syraie,  “ In  the  name  of  the  Lord  and  our 
God,  we  Jeschna  Mesdcho,  sign  the  Gospel,  the  holy  message  of 
Luke  the  Evangelist,  which  he  spoke  and  proclaimed  in  Greek,  in 
Alexandria.”  From  this  diversity,  it  is  clear  that  die  above  tide 
or  inscription  was  prefixed  to  the  Gospel,  not  by  S.  Luke  himself 
but  by  the  Church  which,  in  like  manner,  inscribed  one  Gospel 
“According  to  S.  Matthew,”  one  “ According  to  S.  John,”  and  another 
“According  to  S.  Mark.”  Nay,  as  regards  the  faith  of  the  future, 
this  tide  would  have  been  added  to  no  purpose  by  & Luke  himself, 
unless  die  Church  had  declared  his  Gospel  to  be  genuine  and  not 
supposititious,  and  had  handed  it  down  as  such.  This  speaks  for 
Tradition  against  the  heretics,  for  why  is  the  Gospel,  bearing  the 
name  of  S.  Luke,  to  be  received  as  truly  his,  whilst  that  with  the 
title  of  “ Matthew  and  Thomas  ” is  not  to  be  considered  theirs  ? 
Or  again,  why  is  the  Gospel  of  S.  Luke  more  canonical  than  that  of 
Apelles  or  Basilides?  No  other  reason  can  be  given  but  the  proof, 
declaration,  and  tradition  of  the  Church.  For  we  accept  it,  not 
because  it  is  written  in  the  sacred  books,  but  because  it  has  been 
so  handed  down  by  the  Church.  For  instance,  we  believe  this  to 
be  the  Gospel  of  S.  Luke  and  canonical,  not  because  he'  wrote  it, 
but  because  the  Church  so  delivers  and  teaches.  For  although  its 
own  authority  pertains  to  this  Gospel,  as  to  the  others,  yet  this

authority  would  not  be  plain  to  us,  but  for  the  declaration  of  the 
Church.  The  same  is,  a pari \ to  be  said  of  the  sense  of  Scripture. 
For  the  true  sense  of  Scripture  is  not  what  appears  to  you  or  me, 
for  this  would  be  uncertain  and  doubtful,  for  Calvin  affirms  one  sense 
to  be  the  true  one,  Luther  another,  and  others  another,  but  that 
which  is  taught  and  received  by  the  Church,  whose  office  it  is  to  deliver 
as  well  what  is  the  true  Scripture  as  what  is  its  true  meaning.  For 
Holy  Scripture  consists  not  in  the  bark  (cortice)  of  letters  or  words, 
but  in  their  genuine  meaning.  So  the  Fourth  Session  of  the  Council 
of  Trent,  and  the  Fathers  everywhere,  especially  Tertullian  (B.  iv. 
cap.  5 against  Marcion).  See  what  I have  said  on  S.  Matthew  L i. 

Observe : I.  S.  Matthew  was  the  first  in  order  of  the  Evangelists. 
He  wrote  in  Hebrew  to  the  Jews  in  Judsea.  S.  Mark  was  the 
second.  He  wrote  in  Greek  and  Latin  to  the  Romans  in  Italy; 
then  S.  Luke  wrote  to  the  Greeks  in  Greek ; and  S.  John  last  of  all, 
also  in  Greek ; but  S.  Luke  wrote  the  more  elegantly,  because  he  was 
the  more  perfect  master  of  Greek.  Hear  S.  Jerome  (Ep.  84  to 
Paulinus)  : “ Matthew,  Mark,  Luke,  and  John,  the  quadriga  of  the 
Lord,  and  true  Cherubim  (which  is  interpreted,  the  ‘multitude  of 
knowledge  *),  through  their  whole  body  they  are  ‘ full  of  eyes/  sparks 
shine  from  them,  lightnings  flash  forth,  their  feet  are  ‘ straight,'  and 
point  upwards,  their  backs  are  winged,  and  they  fly  hither  and  thither. 
They  hold  themselves  mutually  one  with  another,  and  are  ‘enfolded* 
with  one  another,  and  are  rolled  together,  like  a wheel,  and  they  go 
wherever  the  influence  of  the  Holy  Spirit  directs  them."  See  Ezekiel 
L 9,  x.  12 ; Revelation  iv.  6-8. 

Moreover,  among  the  faces  or  forms  of  the  four  Cherubim,  the 
third,  that  of  the  ox,  is  ascribed  to  S.  Luke,  as  well  because  he 
begins  from  the  priesthood  of  Zachariah,  whose  chief  sacrifice  was 
an  ox,  as  because  he  underwent  the  labours  of  an  ox  in  the  Gospel, 
and  bore  about  continually  in  his  own  body  the  mortification  of  the 
Cross  for  the  honour  of  the  name  of  Christ,  as  the  Church  sings  of 
him.  See  what  has  been  said  on  Revelation  iv.  7,  and  Ezekiel  L 10. 

II.  S.  Luke  wrote  his  Gospel  against  certain  gaping,  ignorant, 
perhaps  even  false  Evangelists,  who  had  written,  in  Syria  or  Greece,

an  imperfect,  it  m ay  be  a lying  Gospel,  as  S.  Luke  himself  signifies 
in  the  beginning  of  his  work.  So  say  Origen,  S.  Ambrose,  Theo- 
phylact,  and  S.  Epiphanins  (Her.  L i),  who,  however,  when  he  adds 
that  S.  Luke  wrote  against  Cermthus  and  Meritns,  does  not  seem  to 
speak  correctly.  For  these  two,  and  especially  Basilides,  were  lata* 
than  S.  Luke,  as  is  dear  from  Eusebius  (Hist  B.  iii.  ch.  3s).  Theo- 
phylact  and  Bede  think,  with  more  truth,  that  S.  Luke  wrote  against 
the  Apocryphal  Gospels  of  others,  such  as  pass  under  the  names  of 
u Thomas,  Matthew,  and  the  Twelve  Apostles.” 

III.  S,  Luke  was  not  one  of  the  seventy-two  disciples  of  Christ,  as 
Euthymius  and  S.  Gregory  in  his  preface  on  Job,  chap.  L think,  on  the 
authority  of  Origen ; for  S.  Luke  never  saw  Christ  in  the  flesh,  but  he 
wrote  what  he  had  heard  of  Him  from  the  Apostles,  as  he  says 
himselfj  i 2.  Hence  the  Fathers  call  S.  Luke  “ the  disdple  of  the 
Apostles,”  and  S.  Paul  mentions  him  by  name,  as  his  “ fellow- 
labourer.”  So  S.  Jerome,  on  the  65th  chapter  of  Isaiah,  and  preface 
to  S.  Matthew;  where  he  says,  “The  third”  (evangelist)  is  Luke 
the  physician,  by  nation  a Syrian,  of  Antioch,  whose  praise  is  in  the 
Gospel  (2  Cor.  viii  18  and  22),  who  himself  was  a disciple  of  S. 
Paul.  He  wrote  his  Gospel  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Achaia  and 
Bceotia,  relating  some  things  from  the  beginning,  as  he  says  himself, 
and  describing  rather  what  he  heard  than  what  he  saw.  St  Irenseus 
says  the  same,  L 20 ; Theodoret,  on  the  Lives  of  the  holy  Fathers ; 
Baronius,  and  others.  Tertullian,  also  (Book  iv.  against  Marcion, 
chap.  5),  thinks  this  Gospel  not  so  much  S.  Luke’s  as  S.  Paul’s, 
because  S.  Luke  wrote  from  the  dictation  of  S.  Paul,  as  & Mark 
from  that  of  S.  Peter.  For  he  says,  “what  S.  Mark  wrote  may 
be  ascribed  to  S.  Peter,  whose  interpreter  S.  Mark  was.  And  so  the 
Gospel  of  S.  Luke  is  generally  given  to  S.  Paul,  for  the  productions 
of  the  disciples  began  to  be  ascribed  to  the  masters.” 

S.  Jerome  also  states  that  “S.  Luke,  in  the  Gospel  and  Acts, 
performed  the  duties  of  a physician  of  souls,  as  he  had  before  done 
of  bodies  ” (Ep.  103  to  Paulinus) ; and  again  (in  that  to  Philom), 
“Luke  the  physician  left  in  his  Gospel,  and  the  book  of  the 
Acts  of  the  Apostles  to  the  Churches,  how  the  Apostles  from  fishers

of  fish  became  fishers  of  men,  and  from  the  bodies  of  men  became 
concerned  with  their  souls,  whose  Gospel,  as  often  as  it  is  read  in 
the  churches,  fails  not  of  its  medicine.11 

IV.  Baronius  thinks  that  S.  Luke  wrote  in  the  companionship 
of  S.  Paul,  anno  58,  because  S.  Jerome  says  that  he  wrote  his 
Gospel  that  year  in  Achaia  and  Boeotia,  where  S.  Paul  was. 
Others,  however,  are  of  opinion  that  S.  Luke  wrote  earlier,  as  we 
must  certainly  admit,  if  we  agree  with  S.  Jerome  (Lib.  de  Scrip. 
Ecd.  in  Luc.)9  Tertullian  (Book  iv.  against  Marcion,  c.  5),  Primasius, 
Anselm,  and  others,  on  2 Cor.  viil  18,  that  by  “the  brother  whose 
praise  is  in  the  Gospel”  S.  Paul  meant  S.  Luke — as  S.  Ignatius, 
his  fellow-citizen  and  contemporary,  plainly  asserts  in  his  letter  to 
the  Ephesians : “ As  Luke  bears  witness,  whose  praise  is  in  the 
Gospel.”  For  the  Second  Epistle  of  S.  Paul  to  the  Corinthians  was 
written  in  the  year  58,  so  that  if  the  praise  of  S.  Luke  was  in  the 
Gospel  at  that  time,  we  must  necessarily  say  that  it  (the  Gospel) 
had  been  published  previously.  Hence  Euthymius,  and  Theophy- 
lact  in  his  Preface  to  S.  Luke,  say  that  he  wrote  fifteen  years 
after  the  ascension  of  Christ,  that  is,  about  the  year  49.  But 
S.  Luke  had  not  then  joined  S.  Paul,  for  he  came  to  him  in  the 
Troad  in  the  year  51,  as  Baronius  rightly  concludes  from  Acts 
xvi  10.  It  appears,  therefore,  that  S.  Luke  wrote  subsequently  to 
the  year  51,  but  some  years  before  58,  for,  as  S.  Paul  says,  in  that 
year  ne  was  well  known  and  celebrated. 

V.  S.  Luke,  after  he  had  joined  S.  Paul,  passed  some  time  away 
from  him,  having  been  sent  by  him  to  other  places  (as  I have 
shown  on  Acts  xvi  10),  until  S.  Paul,  when  he  had  passed  through 
other  countries,  came  to  Greece,  thence  to  Syria,  and  so  to 
Rome.  Acts  xx.  3,  4.  For  S.  Paul,  with  other  companions  of  his 
voyage,  who  are  named  in  that  verse,  took  S.  Luke  also,  as  & 
Luke  himself  states,  verses  5,  15.  From  that  time  S.  Luke  became 
the  “diligent”  companion  of  S.  Paul,  even  up  to  the  time  of  S. 
Paul’s  first  imprisonment,  which  was  in  the  second  year  of  Nero,  when 
S.  Luke  finished  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  and,  especially,  those  of 
S.  Paul  Then,  as  S.  Epiphanius  says,  S.  Luke  left  S.  Paul  in

prison,  and  went  into  Dalmatia,  Gaul,  Italy,  and  Macedonia,  and 
preached  the  gospel  everywhere  till  he  came  to  Patara,  a city  of 
Achaia,  where,  in  his  eighty-fourth  year,  he  was  crowned  with 
a glorious  martyrdom  in  the  year  of  Christ  61,  the  fifth  of  Nero, 
and  the  seventeenth  of  the  session  of  S.  Peter  at  Rome.  So  Baro- 
nitts  says,  from  S.  Gregory  Nazianxen,  Paulinus,  Gaudentius,  Glyca, 
Nicephorus  and  others. 

Lastly,  who  & Luke  was — of  what  rank  and  ability,  I have 
described  at  length  in  the  Book  of  Acts,  where  I have  said  that 
he  appears  to  be  the  same  as  Lucius,  whom  S.  Paul  calls  his  kins- 
man, Rom  xvi  21.  But  he  seems  different  to  Lucius  of  Cyrene, 
mentioned  in  Acts  ziiL  3.  For  S.  Luke  was  of  Antioch,  not 
Cyrene.  Again,  the  Roman  Marty rology,  on  April  22,  says  that 
Lucius  was  among  the  first  disciples  of  Christ,  which  cannot  be 
said  of  S.  Luke. 

VI.  The  reason  of  S.  Luke’s  having  written  a Gospel  after  SS. 
Matthew  and  Mark,  was  twofold.  1.  To  confute  the  false  gospels 
that  were  then  being  published  in  Syria  and  Greece,  as  I have 
said  before.  2.  To  write  at  length  those  words  and  acts  of  Christ 
which  had  been  passed  over  by  the  other  Evangelists,  and  especially 
His  Infancy  and  Childhood,  the  Annunciation  of  His  forerunner 
John  the  Baptist,  His  Conception,  Nativity,  Presentation  in  the 
Temple,  Presence  among  the  Doctors,  the  Conversion  of  St  Mary 
Magdalene,  Zaccheus,  the  thief  on  the  cross,  the  appearance  to  the 
two  Disciples  at  Emmans,  the  Parables  of  the  Pharisee  and  Publican, 
the  Good  Samaritan,  the  Strayed  Sheep,  the  Lost  Piece  of  Money, 
the  Prodigal  Son,  Lazarus  and  the  Rich  Glutton,  and  others ; which 
show  the  mercy  and  pity  of  Christ  to  sinners  and  the  miserable. 
See  S.  Irenseus,  iil  4,  who  recounts  each.  S.  Luke  also  relates, 
more  fully  than  the  others,  the  Passion,  Resurrection,  and  Ascen- 
sion. 

Lastly,  S.  Peter  Damianus,  in  his  Sermon  on  S.  Matthew,  says, 
“S.  Luke  observes  the  proper  method  and  order  when  he  describes 
the  priestly  stock  of  the  Lord  and  His  Person,  and,  with  this  object 
and  intent,  proceeds  to  describe  at  length  every  part  of  the  Temple

and  tbe  priests,  to  the  end  of  the  history.  For,  as  the  Mediator 
between  God  and  man  in  His  human  nature,  He  pleased  to  be 
King  and  Priest  in  one,  that  through  His  kingly  power  He  might 
rule,  and,  by  His  office  of  Priest,  atone  for  us.  These  two 
44  Personae  ” of  Christ  are  especially  praised  by  the  Fathers,  for  to 
Him  principally  and  by  singular  prerogative  God  gave  the  seat 
of  His  Father  David,  that  there  might  be  no  end  of  His  Kingdom, 
and  that  He  might  be  a Priest  for  ever,  after  the  order  of  Mel- 
chisedek. 

S.  Anselm  again,  on  Colos.  iv.,  gives  two  reasons  why  S. 
Luke,  more  than  the  others,  should  speak  of  the  mercy  of  Christ 
i.  S.  Luke  was  a physician  of  bodies;  then,  when  he  turned  to 
Christ,  he  was  made  a physician  of  souls.  Hence  he  speaks, 
more  than  the  other  Evangelists,  of  the  mercies  of  the  Redeemer, 
by  which  the  weaknesses  of  sins  are  driven  away.  2.  In  Christ,  he 
describes  the  person  of  a Priest,  making  intercession  for  the  sins 
of  the  whole  world. 

Lastly,  our  own  John  de  la  Haye,  in  his  Oparat.  Evangel. 
chap.  68,  recounts  the  twenty-five  privileges  granted  to  S.  Luke, 
where,  among  other  things,  from  S.  Jerome,  Bede,  and  Ado,  he 
says  that  S.  Luke  never  committed  mortal  sin,  but  passed  a strict 
life  of  continual  mortification ; that  he  also  preserved  his  virginity 
to  the  end,  and  was  therefore  beloved  by  the  Blessed  Virgin  especi- 
ally and  before  all  others. 

S.  Ambrose  and  Titus  of  Bostra  have  commented  especially  on 
S.  Luke.  And  Tertullian,  in  his  whole  work  against  Marcion  (who 
had  declared  the  Gospel  of  S.  Luke,  though  adulterated,  to  be  his 
own),  treats  of  and  explains  many  passages  of  this  GospeL  Cardinal 
Toletus,  also,  wrote  at  length,  and  with  exactness,  on  the  first 
twelve  chapters.

THE 


HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  JESUS  CHRIST, 

ACCORDING  TO  S.  LUKE. 


CHAPTER  I. 

r The  preface  of  Luke  to  his  whole  gospel.  5 The  conception  of John  the  Baptist \ 26 
and  of  Christ.  39  The  prophecy  of  Elisabeth , and  of  Mary,  concerning  Christ 
57  The  nativity  and  circumcision  of  John.  67  The  prophecy  of  Zacharias , doth 
of  Christ , 76  and  of  John. 

FORASMUCH  as  many  have  taken  in  hand  to  set  forth  in  order  a declaration 
of  those  things  which  are  most  surely  believed  among  us, 

2  Even  as  they  delivered  them  unto  us,  which  from  the  beginning  were  eye- 
witnesses, and  ministers  of  the  word  ; 

3  It  seemed  good  to  me  also,  having  had  perfect  understanding  of  all  things 
from  the  very  first,  to  write  unto  thee  in  order,  most  excellent  Theophilus, 

4  That  thou  mightest  know  the  certainty  of  those  things,  wherein  thou  hast 
been  instructed. 

5  'T'HERE  was  in  the  days  of  Herod,  the  king  of  Judaea,  a certain  priest 
JL  named  Zacharias,  of  the  course  of  Abia  : and  his  wife  was  of  the 
daughters  of  Aaron,  and  her  name  was  Elizabeth. 

6  And  they  were  both  righteous  before  God,  walking  in  all  the  commandments 
and  ordinances  of  the  Lord  blameless. 

7  And  they  had  no  child,  because  that  Elizabeth  was  barren,  and  they  both 
were  now  well  stricken  in  years. 

8  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  while  he  executed  the  priest’s  office  before  God  in 
the  order  of  his  course, 

9  According  to  the  custom  of  the  priest’s  office,  his  lot  was  to  burn  incense 
when  he  went  into  the  temple  of  the  Lord. 

10  And  the  whole  multitude  of  the  people  were  praying  without  at  the  time 
of  incense. 

11  And  there  appeared  unto  him  an  angel  of  the  Lord  standing  on  the  right 
side  of  the  altar  of  incense.

S.  LUKE,  c.  I. 


12  And  when  Zacharias  saw  him , he  was  troubled,  and  fear  fell  upon  him. 

13  But  the  angel  said  unto  him,  Fear  not,  Zacharias  : for  thy  prayer  is  heard ; 
and  thy  wife  Elizabeth  shall  bear  thee  a son,  and  thou  shalt  call  his  name  John. 

14  And  thou  shalt  have  joy  and  gladness  ; and  many  shall  rejoice  at  his  birth. 

15  For  he  shall  be  great  in  the  sight  of  the  Lord,  and  shall  drink  neither  wine 
nor  strong  drink ; and  he  shall  be  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  even  from  his 
mother's  womb. 

16  And  many  of  the  children  of  Israel  shall  he  turn  to  the  Lord  their  God. 

17  And  he  shall  go  before  him  in  the  spirit  and  power  of  Elias,  to  turn  the 
hearts  of  the  fathers  to  the  children,  and  the  disobedient  to  the  wisdom  of  the 
just ; to  make  ready  a people  prepared  for  the  Lord. 

18  And  Zacharias  said  unto  the  angel,  Whereby  shall  I know  this  ? for  I am 
an  old  man,  and  my  wife  well  stricken  in  years. 

19  And  the  angel  answering  said  unto  him,  I am  Gabriel,  that  stand  in  the 
presence  of  God  ; and  am  sent  to  speak  unto  thee,  and  to  shew  thee  these  glad 
tidings. 

20  And,  behold,  thou  shalt  be  dumb,  and  not  able  to  speak,  until  the  day  that 
these  things  shall  be  performed,  because  thou  believest  not  my  words,  which  shall 
be  fulfilled  in  their  season. 

21  And  the  people  waited  for  Zacharias,  and  marvelled  that  he  tarried  so  long 
in  the  temple. 

22  And  when  he  came  out,  he  could  not  speak  unto  them  1 and  they  perceived 
that  he  had  seen  a vision  in  the  temple : for  he  beckoned  unto  them,  and  re- 
mained speechless. 

23  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  soon  as  the  days  of  his  ministration  were 
accomplished,  he  departed  to  his  own  house. 

24  And  after  those  days  his  wife  Elizabeth  conceived,  and  hid  herself  five 
months,  saying, 

25  Thus  hath  the  Lord  dealt  with  me  in  the  days  wherein  he  looked  on  mg, 
to  take  away  my  reproach  among  men. 

26  And  in  the  sixth  month  the  angel  Gabriel  was  sent  from  God  unto  a city 
of  Galilee,  named  Nazareth, 

27  To  a virgin  espoused  to  a man  whose  name  was  Joseph,  of  the  house  of 
David  ; and  the  virgin's  name  was  Mary. 

28  And  the  angel  came  in  unto  her,  and  said,  Hail,  thou  that  art  highly 
favoured,  the  Lord  is  with  thee  s blessed  art  thou  among  women. 

29  And  when  she  saw  him , she  was  troubled  at  his  saying,  and  cast  in  her 
mind  what  manner  of  salutation  this  should  be. 

30  And  the  angel  said  unto  her,  Fear  not,  Mary : for  thou  hast  found  favour 
with  God. 

31  And,  behold,  thou  shalt  conceive  in  thy  womb,  and  bring  forth  a son,  and 
shalt  call  his  name  JESUS. 

32  He  shall  be  great,  and  shall  be  called  the  Son  of  the  Highest : and  the 
Lord  God  shall  give  unto  him  the  throne  of  his  father  David  : 

33  And  he  shall  reign  over  the  house  of  Jacob  for  ever ; and  of  his  kingdom 
there  shall  be  no  end. 

34  Then  said  Mary  unto  the  angel,  How  shall  this  be,  seeing  I know  not  a 
man? 

35  And  the  angel  answered  and  said  unto  her,  The  Holy  Ghost  shall  come

upon  thee,  and  the  power  of  the  Highest  shall  overshadow  thee : therefore  also 
that  holy  thing  which  shall  be  bom  of  thee  shall  be  called  the  Son  of  God. 

36  And,  behold,  thy  cousin  Elizabeth,  she  hath  also  conceived  a son  in  her 
old  age  : and  this  is  the  sixth  month  with  her,  who  was  called  barren. 

37  For  with  God  nothing  shall  be  impossible. 

38  And  Mary  said,  Behold  the  handmaid  of  the  Lord ; be  it  unto  me  according 
to  thy  word.  And  the  angel  departed  from  her. 

39  And  Mary  arose  in  those  days,  and  went  into  the  hill  country  with  haste, 
into  a city  of  Juda ; 

40  And  entered  into  the  house  of  Zacharias,  and  saluted  Elizabeth. 

41  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  when  Elizabeth  heard  the  salutation  of  Mary, 
the  babe  leaped  in  her  womb  ; and  Elizabeth  was  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost : 

4 2 And  she  spake  out  with  a loud  voice,  and  said,  Blessed  art  thou  among 
women,  and  blessed  is  the  fruit  of  thy  womb. 

43  And  whence  is  this  to  me,  that  the  mother  of  my  Lord  should  come  to  me  ? 

44  For,  lo,  as  soon  as  the  voice  of  the  salutation  sounded  in  mine  ears,  the 
babe  leaped  in  my  womb  for  joy. 

45  And  blessed  is  she  that  believed  : for  there  shall  be  a performance  of  those 
things  which  were  told  her  from  the  Lord. 

46  And  Mary  said,  My  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord, 

4 7 And  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in  God  my  Saviour. 

48  For  he  hath  regarded  the  low  estate  of  his  handmaiden : for,  behold,  from 
henceforth  all  generations  shall  call  me  blessed. 

49  For  he  that  is  mighty  hath  done  to  me  great  things ; and  holy  is  his  name. 

50  And  his  mercy  is  on  them  that  fear  him  from  generation  to  generation. 

51  He  hath  shewed  strength  with  his  arm ; he  hath  scattered  the  proud  in  the 
imagination  of  their  hearts. 

52  He  hath  put  down  the  mighty  from  their  seats,  and  exalted  them  of  low 
degree. 

53  He  hath  filled  the  hungry  with  good  things;  and  the  rich  he  hath  sent 
empty  away. 

54  He  hath  holpen  his  servant  Israel,  in  remembrance  of  his  mercy ; 

55  As  he  spake  to  our  fathers,  to  Abraham,  and  to  his  seed  for  ever. 

56  And  Mary  abode  with  her  about  three  months,  and  returned  to  her  own 
house. 

57  Now  Elizabeth’s  full  time  came  that  she  should  be  delivered;  and  she 
brought  forth  a son. 

58  And  her  neighbours  and  her  cousins  heard  how  the  Lord  had  shewed  great 
mercy  upon  her ; and  they  rejoiced  with  her. 

59  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  on  the  eighth  day  they  came  to  circumcise  the 
child  ; and  they  called  him  Zacharias,  after  the  name  of  his  father. 

60  And  his  mother  answered  and  said,  Not  so  ; but  he  shall  be  called  John. 

61  And  they  said  unto  her,  There  is  none  of  thy  kindred  that  is  called  by  this 
name. 

62  And  they  made  signs  to  his  father,  how  he  would  have  him  called. 

63  And  he  asked  for  a writing  table,  and  wrote,  saying,  His  name  is  John. 
And  they  marvelled  all. 

64  And  his  mouth  was  opened  immediately,  and  his  tongue  loosed \ and  he 
spake,  and  praised  God.

S.  LUKE,  C.  I. 


65  And  fear  came  on  all  that  dwelt  round  about  them  : and  all  these  sayings 
were  noised  abroad  throughout  all  the  hill  country  of  Judaea. 

66  And  all  they  that  heard  them  laid  them  up  in  their  hearts,  saying,  What 
manner  of  child  shall  this  be  ! And  the  hand  of  the  Lord  was  with  him. 

67  And  his  father  Zacharias  was  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  and  prophesied  1 
saying, 

68  Blessed  be  the  Lord  God  of  Israel ; for  he  hath  visited  and  redeemed  his 
people. 

69  And  hath  raised  up  an  horn  of  salvation  for  us  in  the  house  of  his  servant 
David  ; 

70  As  he  spake  by  the  mouth  of  his  holy  prophets,  which  have  been  since  the 
world  began : 

71  That  we  should  be  saved  from  our  enemies,  and  from  the  hand  of  all  that 
hate  us ; 

72  To  perform  the  mercy  promised  to  our  fathers,  and  to  remember  his  holy 
covenant ; 

73  The  oath  which  he  sware  to  our  father  Abraham, 

74  That  he  would  grant  unto  us,  that  we  being  delivered  out  of  the  hand  of 
our  enemies  might  serve  him  without  fear, 

75  In  holiness  and  righteousness  before  him,  all  the  days  of  our  life. 

76  And  thou,  child,  shah  be  called  the  prophet  of  the  Highest : for  thou  shalt 
go  before  the  face  of  the  Lord  to  prepare  his  ways  ; 

77  To  give  knowledge  of  salvation  unto  his  people  by  the  remission  of  their 
sins, 

78  Through  the  tender  mercy  of  our  God  ; whereby  the  dayspring  from  on 
high  hath  visited  us, 

79  To  give  light  to  them  that  sit  in  darkness  and  in  the  shadow  of  death,  to 
guide  our  feet  into  the  way  of  peace. 

80  And  the  child  grew,  and  waxed  strong  in  spirit,  and  was  in  the  deserts  till 
the  day  of  his  shewing  unto  Israel. 

Ver.  1.— Forasmuch  as  many . Maldonatus  is  of  opinion  that 

the  Evangelists  Matthew  and  Mark  are  intended ; but  these  were 
not  many,  but  only  two . S.  Luke  rather  seems  here  to  allude  to 
the  Apocryphal  Gospels,  which  were  circulated  under  the  names  of 
Matthias,  Thomas,  and  other  apostles.

TheophUus.  Theophilus  was  a noble  and  chief  man  of  Antioch, 
who  was  converted  by  S.  Peter  and  dedicated  his  house  as  a church 
in  which  S.  Peter  held  assemblies  of  Christians,  and  placed  his  chair 
as  primate,  as  S.  Clement  relates  Recog.  lib.  10,  cap.  ult.  Baronius 
conjectures  that  S.  Luke,  who  was  a physician  and  painter  of  Antioch, 
wrote  to  Theophilus  as  a citizen  and  as  his  own  intimate  friend ; 
Theophylact  adds  that  S.  Luke  was  a catechumen  of  Theophilus, 
for  S.  Peter  by  himself  was  not  able  to  instruct  the  multitude  who 
came  together  to  be  taught  the  faith  of  Christ,  and  therefore  he 
made  use  of  the  labours  of  many  others  for  instructing  the  faithful. 
He  is  called  most  excellent , which  was  a title  given  to  governors  and 
magistrates ; he  seems  therefore  to  have  been  a senator  or  governor 
of  Antioch.

Ver.  5. — There  was  in  the  days  of  Herod.  S.  Luke  begins  by 
mentioning  the  name  of  Herod  to  point  out  the  time  when  John 
the  Baptist  and  Christ  were  bom ; and  also  to  show  that  the  sceptre 
had  now  departed  from  Judah,  and  had  passed  over  to  an  alien, 
and  therefore  that  the  time  for  the  advent  of  the  Messiah  was  at 
hand  according  to  the  prophecy  of  Jacob,  Gen.  xlix.  10.  This 
Herod  was  the  first  of  that  name,  surnamed  the  Great,  the  father 
and  grandfather  of  the  others.  He  was  a native  of  Ascalon,  an 
Idumaean  by  nation,  in  character  a tyrant  By  the  favour  of  Caesar 
he  held  the  kingdom  of  Judaea;  but  Christ  thrust  him  and  his

descendants  out  of  this  kingdom,  and  claimed  for  Himself  the  king- 
dom over  Israel  which  by  right  was  due  to  Him,  though  it  must  be 
understood  as  a spiritual  kingdom. 

Hence  he  is  rightly  called  Herod ; for  Herod  in  Syriac  is  the 
same  as  “ a fiery  dragon.”  According  to  Pagninus,  Herod  signifies 
in  Hebrew  “ the  conception  of  threshing,”  for  inn  is  to  conceive, 
and  WH  to  thresh,  because  he  slew  the  infants  in  Bethlehem. 

Zacharias . He  was  a priest  and  also  a prophet,  as  will  appear 
from  verses  64  and  67.  Whence  his  name  is  enrolled  among  the 
saints  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  for  the  5th  of  November:  where 
Baronius,  following  Origen,  Nyssen,  Cyril,  and  Peter  Alexander,  is  of 
opinion  that  this  Zacharias  was  the  martyr  who  was  slain  by  Herod 
between  the  Temple  and  the  Altar,  and  therefore  that  he  was  the 
one  whom  Christ  mentions,  S.  Matt,  xxiii.  35.  His  head  is  preserved 
and  shown  at  Rome  in  the  Lateran  Basilica,  from  which  there  is  a 
tradition  that  formerly  blood  trickled  during  several  days.  I have 
seen  it  there  and  venerated  it 

Of  the  course  of  Abia.  Of  that  class  of  the  priests  of  which  in  the 
time  of  David  Abia  was  the  head.  For  David,  seeing  that  the 
priests,  the  sons  of  Aaron,  had  increased  to  a large  number,  so  that 
all  could  not  at  once  minister  in  the  Temple,  distributed  them  into 
twenty-four  classes,  so  that  each  class  might  minister  in  the  Temple 
during  one  week  in  succession.  And  that  there  might  be  no  strife 
among  them  as  to  which  course  should  be  the  first,  second,  or  third, 
&c.,  these  families  cast  lots,  and  obtained  the  first  place  or  second, 
&c.,  according  as  the  lot  came  out.  In  this  drawing  of  lots  the 
eighth  place  fell  to  Abia  and  his  descendants.  All  this  is  clear  from 
1 Chron.  xxiv.  Josephus  ( Antiq . vii.  11)  says  of  David,  “He  found 
twenty-four  families  of  priests,  and  he  appointed  that  each  family 
should  minister  before  God  during  eight  days,  from  Sabbath  to 
Sabbath,”  in  order  to  avoid  confusion  and  strife  among  the  priests. 

And  his  wife  was  of  the  daughters  of  Aaron.  Priests  could  marry 
a wife  from  another  tribe  because  they  had  no  inheritance  in 
the  land  of  Israel,  which  by  the  marriage  of  the  wife  (if  she  through 
the  failure  of  male  offspring  were  the  heir  of  her  father)  passed  over

THE  NAME  “ELIZABETH.” 

to  her  husband’s  tribe,  and  so  a confusion  was  caused  of  inherit- 
ances and  tribes  which  was  forbidden  by  the  law.  But  Zacharias 
having  more  regard  to  religion,  married  a wife  not  only  of  the 
daughters  of  Levi,  but  of  Aaron.  Wherefore  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ Not 
only  from  his  parents  but  from  his  ancestors  the  illustrious  descent 
of  S.  John  is  derived,  a descent  not  exalted  by  secular  power,  but 
venerable  from  its  sanctity.  She  was  called  Elizabeth  from  the  wife 
of  the  first  high  priest  Aaron,  Exod.  vi.  23.  This  Elizabeth  was 
holy,  and  a prophetess:  whence  her  memory  is  observed  in  the 
Roman  Martyrology  on  the  5th  of  November.  From  her  S.  Elizabeth, 
daughter  of  Andrew,  king  of  the  Hungarians,  sumamed  the  mother 
of  the  poor,  and  her  niece  S.  Elizabeth,  the  queen  of  Portugal  took, 
their  name  together  with  her  sanctity. 

And  her  name  was  Elizabeth.  Zacharias  in  Hebrew  is  the  same 
as  “ God  remembered and  Elizabeth,  “ the  oath  of  God,”  or  “ the 
sceptre  and  dominion,”  or  “rest,*'  or  “fulness  of  God.”  So  that  the 
meaning  is  that  God,  mindful  of  His  oath,  united  these  two  in 
marriage,  that  He  might  raise  up  the  sceptre  of  the  house  of  David, 
and  bestow  rest  and  plenty  and  abundance  on  His  own. 

Ver.  6. — Righteous  (Just)  before  God.  Many  appear  just  before 
men,  but  few  before  God,  because  men  look  upon  the  countenance, 
but  God  on  the  heart  and  conscience.  S.  Francis  says  truly, 
“Each  man  is  what  he  is  before  God,  and  no  more.” 

Walking  in  all  the  commandments , &c.  Commandments , i.e.  the 
moral  precepts  of  the  Decalogue.  Ordinances , ie.  the  ceremonial

God  gave  to  the  Hebrews  by  Moses  precepts  of  three  kinds.  1. 
Moral  precepts,  which  are  contained  in  the  two  tables  of  the  law. 
a.  Judgments  which  relate  to  justice  and  human  polity,  and  chiefly 
concern  princes.  3.  Statutes,  decrees  ceremonial,  pertaining  to  the 
sacrifices  and  rites  observed  in  the  worship  of  God.  These  are 
called  here  and  elsewhere  Justifications , Vulgate:  first,  because 
those  who  observe  them  do  what  is  most  right  and  just,  that  is  to 
say,  perform  the  service  and  worship  which  is  most  rightfully  due 
to  God.  Secondly,  because  by  the  observance  of  these  men  for-

merly  under  the  old  law  were  justified  legally ; for  those  who  ful- 
filled them  were  considered  just  persons  by  the  Synagogue,  and  that 
not  only  before  man  but  before  God,  if  they  performed  those  things 
from  the  true  love  of  God.  For  the  doers  of  the  law  are  justified , 
Rom.  ii.  13. 

Blameless.  Sine  quereld , Vulgate;  Greek.  Mark  here 

that  the  faithful  can,  yea,  ought  to  observe  all  the  commandments 
of  God ; wherefore  it  is  possible  to  keep  them,  and  not  impossible, 
as  Calvin  blasphemously  asserts,  who  in  this  place  makes  a wonder- 
ful exhibition  of  himself,  and  all  but  says  that  Luke  the  Evangelist 
is  a liar. 

Further,  blameless  may  be  interpreted  as  “without  mortal  sin,” 
for  no  just  man  in  this  life  can  avoid  all  venial  sins. 

Ver.  7. — Well  stricken  in  years . He  says  this  to  show  that  John 
was  bom  of  them,  not  in  the  way  of  nature,  but  by  the  gift  of  God 
and  by  a miracle,  like  other  eminent  saints,  as  Isaac,  Joseph, 
Samuel.  S.  Augustine  (Serm.  iii.  on  John  the  Baptist)  says  Elizabeth 
was  barren  in  body  but  fruitful  in  virtues ; her  child-bearing  was  not 
taken  away  from  her,  but  it  was  delayed,  until  the  time  of  fleshly 
desire  had  passed  away.  ...  In  short,  when  all  that  causes  blame 
as  regards  the  body  was  quenched,  and  they  became  altogether 
blameless,  all  that  speaks  of  barrenness  is  gone ; old  age  springs 
into  new  life,  faith  conceives,  chastity  brings  forth,  one  greater  than 
man,  one  equal  to  the  angels  is  bom,  the  trumpet  of  heaven,  the 
herald  of  Christ,  the  mystery  of  the  Father,  the  messenger  of  the 
Son,  the  standard-bearer  of  the  heavenly  King,  the  pardon  of  ^ 
sinners,  the  correction  of  the  Jews,  the  calling  of  the  Gentiles,  and, 
so  to  say,  the  uniting  bond  of  the  Law  and  Grace. 

Ver.  9. — According  to  the  custom  of  the  priesthood  his  lot  was. 
That  is,  according  to  Bede,  in  his  own  course,  which  was  the  eighth 
in  order,  according  to  the  lot  which  had  originally  fallen  to  the 
family  of  Abia.  But  mention  of  this  course  has  been  made  in 
verse  8;  and  therefore  the  lot  spoken  of  in  verse  9 is  different 
from  the  course,  and  more  particularly  limits  the  course.  The 
meaning,  therefore,  is  that  when  Zacharias,  in  the  order  of  his  course,

was  ministering  in  the  temple,  among  the  Yarious  offices  of  the 
priests  the  office  of  burning  incense  fell  to  him  by  lot  For  because 
there  were  many  priests  of  the  course  of  Abia,  it  was  appointed 
to  them  by  lot  what  office  each  of  them  should  perform  in  the 
Temple.  For  there  were  four  principal  offices  (see  Exodus  xxx.) 
— i.  To  sacrifice.  2.  To  light  the  lamps  on  the  seven-branched 
candlestick.  3.  On  the  sabbath-day  to  place  twelve  new  loaves  on 
the  table  of  shewbread.  4.  To  bum  incense  on  the  altar  of  incense. 
This  fourth  office,  therefore,  had  fallen  by  lot  to  Zacharias,  while  the 
three  others  had  fallen  to  other  priests  of  the  same  class  of  Abia. 
This  is  clear  from  the  Greek  fXa^i  r«D  (fafjufaat,  “ he  had  obtained 
by  lot  to  bum  incense.” 

Some,  as  S.  Ambrose,  Bede,  Theophylact,  and  S.  Augustine  think 
that  Zacharias  was  the  high  priest,  because  he  burnt  incense  on  the 
altar  of  incense,  for  they  think  that  this  was  in  the  Holy  of  holies, 
which  no  one  except  the  high  priest  might  enter.  But  I have  shown 
(Exod.  xL  24),  that  this  altar  was  not  in  the  Holy  of  holies,  but  in 
the  Holy  place,  which  the  common  priests  used  to  enter  daily.  The 
expression  here  used,  it  was  his  lot  ( sorts  exiit  Vulgate)  confirms 
this ; for  the  high  priest  was  superior  to  all  lots,  and,  whenever  he 
chose,  used  to  minister  in  the  temple.  Besides,  at  this  time,  not 
Zacharias  but  Joazar  was  the  high  priest,  as  Josephus  tells  us 
( Antiq . xvil  8). 

Morally,  we  may  learn  that  angels  appear  while  we  are  engaged 
in  sacred  things,  and  that  God  either  Himself  or  by  an  angel  speaks 
with  the  soul  when  we  are  engaged  in  prayer  or  sacrifice,  as  the 
angel  appeared  to  Zacharias  when  he  was  burning  incense. 

Ver.  10. — And  the  whole  multitude  were  praying  without  That  is 
in  the  court  outside  the  Holy  place  or  Temple,  which  the  priests 
alone  might  enter.  There  were  two  courts ; the  inner  one,  of  the 
priests,  containing  the  altar  of  burnt-offering ; and  the  outer  one,  of 
the  people,  who  from  it  beheld  the  sacrifices  offered  by  the  priests : 
but  the  altar  of  incense  which  was  in  the  Holy  place  they  could 
not  see. 

At  the  time  of  intense.  That  is  to  say,  when  the  priests  burnt  the

incense ; for  according  to  the  religious  usage  of  all  nations  incense 
was  burnt  in  the  worship  of  God. 

Ver.  n. — There  appeared  unto  him  an  angel  (Gabriel,  as  is  clear 
from  v.  19),  standing  on  the  right  side  of  the  altar . 1.  Because  he 

had  come  to  announce  good  tidings.  Euthymius.  2.  Because  he 
brought  down  the  token  of  Divine  mercy,  for  the  Lord  is  on  my 
right  hand,  therefore  I shall  not  be  moved.  S.  Ambrose.  We  may 
learn  from  this  that  angels  stand  by  altars,  priests  and  sacrifices, 
and  co-operate  with  them  in  the  worship  and  adoration  of  God.  Of 
this  there  are  many  instances  in  the  lives  of  the  saints,  some  of 
which  I have  mentioned,  Exod.  xxix.  38 ; Lev.  ix.  24. 

Ver.  12. — Za  chart  as  was  troubled.  Both  because  of  the  unusual 
sight,  and  because  of  the  majesty  in  which  he  appeared,  which 
human  weakness  could  scarcely  endure  to  behold : “ for  man  is  not 
strong  enough  to  bear  such  a strange  and  unusual  sight  without 
alarm.”  Titus.  So  Daniel,  when  the  same  angel  appeared  to  him, 
says,  “ There  remained  no  strength  in  me,  and  my  comeliness  was 
turned  into  corruption.”  Hence  it  is  the  sign  of  a good  angel  if  at 
first  he  causes  fear  and  afterwards  joy ; but  of  a bad  angel  if  he 
makes  a man  sorrowful  after  causing  joy ; whence  S.  Antony  says, 
“If  joy  has  succeeded  to  fear  we  may  know  that  the  vision  is 
from  God;  for  the  peace  of  the  soul  is  a sign  of  the  Divine 
presence;  but  if  the  fear  remains  unshaken  it  is  an  enemy  who 
is  seen.” 

Ver.  13. — Thy  prayer  is  heard.  Not  his  prayer  for  offspring,  S. 
Augustine  says,  of  which  he  now  so  despaired  that  he  did  not  believe 
the  promise  of  the  angel  (verse  20),  but  thy  prayer  as  a priest  for 
the  sins  of  the  people  and  for  the  coming  of  the  Messiah.  But 
God,  who  goes  beyond  the  merits  and  the  prayers  of  suppliants, 
promised  him  a son  who  should  be  the  prophet  and  forerunner.  So 
Bede,  Theophylact,  S.  Augustine,  S.  Chrysostom. 

Some,  however,  are  of  opinion  that  this  prayer  of  Zacharias  was 
for  offspring,  only  that  it  had  been  offered  not  at  this  time,  but 
formerly  when  he  was  younger.

name  John.  Because  John,  according  to  Maldonatus,  is  the  same  in 
Hebrew  as  beloved:  or,  according  to  Pagninus,  the  gift  or  mercy  of  the 
Lord  This  is  not,  however,  the  precise  meaning;  for  then  he 
would  have  rather  been  called  Hananiah  than  John.  Properly, 
therefore,  the  name  John  signifies,  God  hath  had  mercy . And  He  did 
this  first  when  he  heard  the  prayer  of  Zacharias  ; and  secondly  by 
appointing  John  as  the  forerunner  of  the  Messiah,  and  soon  after 
by  sending  the  Messiah  Himself ; for  it  was  by  Christ,  and  not  by 
Moses  and  the  law,  that  grace  came.  So  the  son  of  Anna  was  called 
Samuel,  that  is  asked  and  obtained  from  God  by  the  tears  of  his 
mother  for  the  salvation  of  the  whole  people,  i Sam.  i.  20.  Thirdly, 
God  also  showed  mercy  on  John  himself  (Bede,  Jansen,  Maldonatus), 
by  filling  him  with  His  manifold  grace ; by  which  He  made  him  a 
Doctor  in  Israel,  a Prophet,  an  Anchorite,  a Martyr,  a Virgin,  and 
the  Forerunner  of  Christ  John  therefore  was,  as  it  were,  the  Son 
of  Charities  and  Graces,  in  whom  all  the  Graces  of  God  seem  to 
have  blended  together. 

Mark  here  the  threefold  mystery  of  the  three  names:  for 
Elizabeth,  that  is,  the  oath  ot  God  who  promiseth,  and  Zacharias, 
God’s  remembrance  of  His  promise,  are  the  parents  of  John,  that 
is,  the  mercy  and  grace  of  God. 

Ver.  14. — And  thou  shalt  have  joy  and  gladness.  Thy  son  shall 
be  to  thee  and  to  many  others  the  cause  of  the  greatest  joy  and 
exultation. 

Ver.  15. — Great  tn  the  sight  of  the  Lord:  to  Whom  alone  it 
belongs  to  determine  what  is  great,  what  is  ordinary,  and  what  is 
small.  Many,  says  S.  Theophylact,  are  called  great  in  the  sight  of 
men,  who,  being  little,  esteem  little  things  as  great ; but  John  was 
great  in  the  sight  of  the  Lord,  who,  being  great,  weigheth  things 
that  are  great 

He  was  great  on  account — 1.  of  his  sanctification  in  his  mother’s 
womb ; 2.  the  depth  of  his  humility ; 3.  his  extraordinary  charity ; 
4.  his  exemplary  penitence ; 5.  his  seraphic  zeal ; 6.  his  whole 
life,  which  was  as  much  human  as  angelic ; 7.  the  sublimity  of  his 
prophesying;  8.  his  solitary  life;  9.  his  office  of  forerunner  or

Christ ; io.  his  most  noble  martyrdom.  See  the  twenty  eight  privi- 
leges ascribed  to  John,  which  Baradius  enumerates  here. 

And  he  shall  not  drink  wine  nor  strong  drink.  Strong  drink 
(Sieera)  is  everything  that  intoxicates.  To  abstain  from  wine  and 
strong  drink  was  peculiar  to  Nazarites;  and  from  this  place  it 
appears  that  John  was  one  during  the  whole  of  his  life. 

And  he  shall  be  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost  even  from  his  mothers 
womb . This  was  when,  on  the  entrance  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  he 
leapt  in  his  mother’s  womb,  and,  as  far  as  he  could,  fulfilled  his 
office  of  forerunner.  John,  therefore,  was  bora  again  of  the  Spirit 
before  he  was  bom  of  his  mother. 

Was  John  then  truly  cleansed  from  original  sin  in  the  womb  and 
justified?  S.  Augustine  ( Ep . 57)  and  S.  Jerome  (in  Jerem.  L) 
maintain  that  he  was  not ; for  they  say  that  John  and  Jeremiah  are 
both  said  to  have  been  sanctified  in  the  womb  not  really,  but 
according  to  the  predestination  of  God ; for  they  were  ordained  to 
future  sanctity,  so  that  the  same  is  said  here  concerning  John  that 
the  Apostle  says  of  himself,  Gal.  i.,  “Who  separated  me  from  my 
mother’s  womb.”  The  reason  that  S.  Augustine  gives  is,  that  to 
be  bom  again  presupposes  being  bora;  but  John  when  in  the 
womb  was  not  yet  bora;  therefore  he  could  not  have  been  born 
again  in  reality,  but  only  according  to  the  predestination  of 
God. 

But  the  common  opinion  of  the  Fathers  is  contrary  to  this  (S. 
Athanasius,  Cyprian,  Ambrose,  Gregory,  and  others)  which  I approve 
of— -First,  because  the  angel  here  most  clearly  promises  “ he  shall 
be  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost  even  from  his  mother's  womb.” 
Secondly,  because  at  the  salutation  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  he 
believed  in  Christ  when  in  the  womb.  For  at  that  time  it  was 
when  he  was  visited  and  saluted  by  the  Blessed  Virgin  in  the 
sixth  month  from  his  conception  that  this  wonderful  sanctification 
took  place.  To  the  argument  of  S.  Augustine  I answer,  that  a 
man  in  order  that  he  may  be  bom  again  may  be  considered  as 
bora  when  he  has  been  conceived  in  the  womb ; for  then  as  he 
is  bom  in  original  sin  so  also  he  can  by  grace  be  bora  again  and

JOHN  COMPARED  TO  ELIAS.  1 3 

even  baptized,  as  is  clear  from  the  practice  of  the  Church  in 
certain  cases. 

Ver.  17.—  He  shall  go  before  Him.  John  went  before  Christ 
1.  In  his  birth,  for  he  was  bom  six  months  before  Christ  a.  In 
his  baptism,  for  he  baptized  before  Christ  did ; yea,  he  even 
baptized  Christ  3.  In  preaching  of  repentance  that  he  might 
prepare  the  way  for  Christ  4.  By  pointing  out  Jesus  as  the 
Messiah  and  Lamb  of  God  who  should  take  away  the  sin  of  the 
world.  5.  By  suffering  martyrdom  before  Christ  6.  In  descending 
to  the  fathers  in  limbus,  and  announcing  to  them  that  Christ  would 
soon  come  and  set  them  free. 

In  the  spirit  and  power  of  Elias  As  Elias  did  excel  and  in  the 
end  of  the  world  will  excel  in  a spirit  steadfast  and  powerful  for  con- 
tending against  Antichrist,  so  that  he  will  convert  Jews  and  others 
from  him  to  Christ ; so  in  the  same  powerful  spirit  John  will  excel, 
and  by  his  preaching  and  holy  example  move  the  hardened  Jews  to 
repentance,  and  so  prepare  them  for  the  baptism  of  Christ 

The  spirit  of  power  in  John  was  Hke  that  in  Elias;  1.  In  the 
austerity  of  his  life.  2.  They  both  lived  in  solitude.  And  3,  in 
poverty  and  contempt  of  the  world.  4.  In  zeal,  and  in  fervour  of 
preaching,  by  which  both  of  them  converted  many  Israelites  to 
repentance,  and  Elias  will  again  do  so  in  the  last  days,  according  to 
the  saying  (Ecclesiasticus  xlviil  1),  “ Elias  stood  up  like  fire,  and  his 
word  burned  like  a lamp.”  In  the  same  way  Christ  says  of  John, 
“He  was  a burning  and  a shining  light,”  S.  John  v.  35.  5.  In  forti- 

tude and  suffering : for  as  Elias  contended  against  the  priests  of  Baal, 
and  their  patrons  Ahab  and  Jezebel,  and  again  in  the  last  days  will 
contend  against  Antichrist  and  his  followers  and  will  suffer  many 
things  from  them  and  at  last  be  slain  as  a martyr ; so  John  contended 
against  Herod  and  Herodias,  and  being  beheaded  by  them  obtained 
the  crown  of  martyrdom. 

John  here  is  rather  compared  to  Elias  in  his  future  coming  than 
in  his  past;  because,  as  Elias  will  precede  the  second  coming  of 
Christ  with  great  spirit  and  power,  so  likewise  John  with  the  same 
spirit  and  power  will  precede  the  first  coming  of  Christ  S.  Ambrose

S.  LUKE,  C.  I. 


says  that  he  will  go  before  Him  “ in  the  spirit  and  power  of  Elias, 
because  Elias  had  great  power  and  grace,  so  that  he  turned  back  the 
hearts  of  the  people  to  faith,  power  of  abstinence,  and  patience  and 
the  spirit  of  prophecy.  Elias  was  in  the  wilderness ; so  also  was  John. 
. . . The  one  sought  not  the  favour  of  Ahab ; the  other  despised 
that  of  Herod.  The  one  divided  Jordan;  the  other  brought  men 
to  the  laver  of  salvation.  The  one  was  the  forerunner  of  our  Lord's 
first  advent,  the  other  of  His  second,"  &c. 

To  turn  the  hearts  of  the  fathers , &c.  John  did  this  when  he 
urged  them  by  word  and  example  to  imitate  the  faith  and  piety  of 
their  fathers ; for  thus  the  fathers  acknowledged  their  children  as 
the  worshippers  of  the  true  God.  These  words  are  taken  from 
Malachi,  who  speaks  literally  of  Elias,  typically  of  John. 

And  the  disobedient,  &c.  Greek  dvu&iii,  Vulgate,  incredulos. 
That  is,  he  will  turn  them  to  the  faith  and  wisdom  which  the  just 
had  and  have  concerning  Christ,  which  consists  in  the  fear  and  love 
of  God  and  of  heavenly  things,  and  not  perishable,  according  to  the 
teaching  of  Christ  (Maldonatus).  Or,  John  will  cause  the  unbelieving 
Jews  to  consider  the  signs  of  the  coming  of  the  Messiah  given  by 
God  to  the  fathers,  and  from  them  to  know  and  believe  that  Christ 
has  already  come,  and  that  this  Jesus,  whom  John  pointed  out  as 
such,  is  He. 

A people  prepared , &c  Perfectam , Vulgate;  xaraaxtvdefitw, 

Greek;  that  is  well  and  perfectly  prepared  and  made  ready  for 
receiving  the  teaching  and  faith  of  Christ,  and  the  perfection  of 
grace,  justice,  and  the  Christian  life  brought  by  Christ  from  heaven. 

Ver.  1 8. — And  Zacharias  said  to  the  angel \ &c.  That  is,  give 
a sign  or  a miracle  for  a proof  to  me  that  the  great  things  which  you 
are  promising  will  surely  come  to  pass.  This  hesitation  on  the  part 
of  Zacharias  seems  to  have  proceeded  from  want  of  deliberation  and 
reflection,  and  therefore  was  only  a venial  sin,  for  which  he  was 
punished  by  being  deprived  of  the  power  of  speech.  Far  otherwise 
did  Abraham,  who,  when  the  angel  promised  that  Isaac  should  be 
bom  to  him  from  Sarah  who  was  barren,  immediately  believed; 
“for  he  was  strong  in  faith,  giving  glory  to  God,  being  fully  per-

suaded  that  what  He  had  promised,  He  was  able  also  to  perform,” 
Rom.  iv.  20,  21. 

Ver.  19. — I am  Gabriel \ who  stand \ That  is,  “ I am  wont  to 
stand,  ready  to  minister  to  the  will  of  God  in  all  things ; I am  not 
indeed  now  standing  before  Him  in  heaven,  for  I have  been  sent 
thence  to  thee  to  the  earth.”  Although  on  the  earth  angels  may 
also  stand  before  God,  and  behold  His  Face ; for  God  is  every- 
where (S.  Matt,  xviii.  10).  Hence  we  may  gather  that  the  same 
angels  stand  before  God  and  minister  to  Him,  although  S.  Dio- 
nysius the  Areopagite  and  S.  Gregory  deny  this ; for  Gabriel  stands 
before  God  and  ministers  to  Him,  and  is  sent  to  Zacharias. 

Moreover,  the  words  “ stand  before  ” signify  that  Gabriel  is  one  of 
the  seven  angels  who  are  the  chiefs  of  the  heavenly  court,  as  are 
also  Michael  and  Raphael  (Tobit  xii.  15).  Of  these  seven  angels 
I have  spoken  at  length  on  Apocal.  i.  4.  Wherefore  although  some, 
as  Toletus,  are  of  opinion  that  Gabriel  belongs  to  the  last  order  but 
one,  which  is  that  of  archangels,  because  he  is  elsewhere  called  an 
archangel,  yet  he  more  truly  seems  to  be  one  of  the  first  order 
which  is  that  of  seraphim,  and  therefore  is  called  by  many  an 
archangel ; and  there  are  not  wanting  some  who  think  that  he  is 
the  first  of  all  among  the  seraphim.  Cardinal  Vignerius  (in 
Decaehordo  Christ  Cord  i.  2)  proves  this  by  eight  reasons  which 
I have  enumerated  on  Dan.  ix.  21.  All  of  which  are  reduced  to 
this  one.  For  the  highest  work  it  is  fitting  that  the  highest  angel 
should  be  sent;  but  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  is  the  highest 
work  of  God,  therefore  Gabriel,  who  was  sent  to  announce  that,  is 
the  highest  angel.  But  this  reason  is  not  conclusive,  as  I have 
there  shown.  For  the  common  opinion  of  theologians  is  that 
Michael  is  the  highest  of  all  the  angels,  and  the  Antagonist  of 
Lucifer.  Apocal.  xii.  7. 

Gabriel  in  Hebrew  means  God  hath  strengthened  me , or  the 
strength  of  God , or  God  is  my  strength.  He  is  therefore  fitly  sent 
to  announce  the  birth  of  John  and  to  bestow  upon  him  the  spirit 
of  power. 

Ver.  20. — And  behold  thou  shalt  be  dumbt  &c.  Theophylact  and

S.  Ambrose  translated,  “thou  shalt  be  deaf,”  and  so  make  a dis- 
tinction from  what  follows,  “ and  not  able  to  speak.”  For  although 
the  Greek  word  etwrw  properly  signifies  one  who  is  dumb,  yet  one 
who  is  deaf  may  be  understood  by  the  same  word ; for  dumbness 
and  deafness  are  naturally  connected,  for  those  who  are  bom  dumb 
are  also  deaf,  and  vice  versa . Wherefore  the  Greeks  alike  call  a 
dumb  and  a deaf  man  xipor.  Zacharias  therefore  was  made  deaf 
as  well  as  dumb.  Whence  in  verse  22  he  is  called  x£po;.  Hence 
at  verse  62  his  friends  and  neighbours  do  not  speak  to  Zacharias 
as  being  deaf,  but  signify  to  him  by  signs  that  he  should  write  the 
name  by  which  he  wished  his  son  to  be  called.  “ He  rightly,”  says 
Theophylact,  u suffered  these  two  things,  the  loss  of  hearing  and  the 
loss  of  speech ; for  because  he  had  been  disobedient,  he  incurs  the 
punishment  of  deafness ; and  because  he  had  objected,  of  silence.” 
Until  the  day  that  these  things , &c  Zacharias  not  believing  the 
promises  of  the  angel,  had  asked  for  a sign  to  be  given  him  of  the 
birth  of  John;  the  angel  therefore  complying  gives  him  a sign 
which  at  the  same  time  shall  be  a punishment 
Ver.  23. — The  days  of  his  ministration,  &c.  Xi/roi/fy/a;,  Greek. 
That  is  of  his  sacred  ministration  in  the  Temple.  His  house  was 
situated  in  the  mountains  of  Judsea,  where  his  wife  Elizabeth  was. 

Ver.  24. — After  those  days  his  wife  conceived.  Elizabeth  con- 
ceived about  the  24th  of  September,  on  which  day  many  Christian 
Churches  celebrate  the  conception  of  John.  So  that  the  incense 
was  offered  by  Zacharias,  and  his  vision  and  the  promise  of  the 
angel  concerning  the  birth  of  John  seem  to  have  taken  place  a 
little  earlier,  during  the  feast  of  Tabernacles.  By  this  it  was  signi- 
fied that  John  would  be  bom,  who  was  to  be  the  herald  of  Christ, 
and  through  Him  the  cause  of  common  joy  to  the  whole  world ; for 
he  would  teach  men  that  they  were  strangers  upon  the  earth,  and 
that  they  dwelt  in  it  as  in  a temporary  tabernacle,  and  that  they 
were  enrolled  by  God  as  citizens  of  heaven,  where  they  would 
obtain  an  eternal  and  most  blessed  home.  For  the  Feast  of  Taber- 
nacles was  a sign  of  all  these  things,  during  which  the  Hebrews 
with  branches  of  palm  trees  used  to  celebrate  dances  joyfully,

because  they  had  been  brought  in  by  God  into  the  promised  land, 
after  they  had  been  dwelling  in  tents  during  forty  years  in  the 
wilderness.  Hence  it  seems  that  John  was  conceived  about  the 
time  of  the  autumnal  equinox,  and  bom  about  the  time  of  the 
summer  solstice,  after  which  the  days  decrease  in  length ; while,  on 
the  other  hand,  Christ  was  conceived  at  the  vernal  equinox,  and 
bom  at  the  winter  solstice,  after  which  the  days  increase ; because, 
as  John  said,  “ He  must  increase,  but  I must  decrease.” 

She  hid  herself  five  months , &c  This  hiding  was  a sign  of  shame 
and  modesty ; for  she  blushed  at  her  child-bearing  on  account  of  her 
age,  says  S.  Ambrose ; but  in  the  sixth  month,  when  she  heard  and 
saw  that  her  kinswoman  the  Blessed  Virgin  had  conceived  without 
losing  her  virginity  (which  was  a much  more  strange  and  wonderful 
thing),  then  she  laid  aside  her  shame  and  went  forth  openly. 

My  reproach . Among  the  Jews  in  that  age,  barrenness  was  a 
great  reproach,  and  was  considered  as  a sign  of  the  malediction 
of  God. 

Ver.  26. — In  the  sixth  month.  That  is  the  sixth  month  from  the 
conception  of  John.  Christ  was  therefore  six  months  younger  than 
John  the  Baptist  We  ought  to  understand  that  this  sixth  month 
was  not  beginning  but  ending,  or  rather  ended ; for  from  the  24th 
of  September,  when  John  was  conceived,  to  the  25th  of  March,  when 
Christ  was  conceived,  there  are  six  whole  months.  The  Annun- 
ciation therefore  by  Gabriel,  and  consequently  the  Incarnation  of  the 
Word,  took  place  on  the  25th  of  March ; on  which  day  likewise, 
Christ,  after  completing  the  thirty-fourth  year  of  His  life,  was  cruci- 
fied. Many  are  of  opinion  that  the  world  was  created  on  the  same 
day ; so  that  it  was  created  by  God  on  the  same  day  on  which  it 
was  afterwards  recreated  and  restored  by  Christ  in  His  Incarnation 
and  Cross.  Whence  it  is  that  from  this  day  of  March,  the  English, 
the  Venetians,  the  Pisans,  and  several  other  nations  reckon  the 
years  after  Christ 

The  Angel  Gabriel.  S.  Jerome  remarks  on  Daniel  viil  that  there 
are  three  angels,  Michael,  Raphael,  and  Gabriel,  who  are  especially 

mentioned  in  Scripture  3 of  whom  Michael  presides  over  the

prayers  and  offerings  of  the  faithful,  and  is  therefore  called  Michael 
(tnat  is,  who  is  like  God) ; for  it  is  the  prerogative  of  God  alone  to 
hear  the  prayers  of  penitents:  while  Raphael  presides  over  the 
healing  of  men’s  bodies,  and  he  therefore  restored  sight  to  Tobias 
when  he  was  blind ; whence  he  is  called  Raphael  (that  is  the  Healer 
or  the  Healing  of  God);  and  thirdly  Gabriel  (or  the  strength  of 
God)  presides  over  the  conflicts  and  wars  of  the  faithful  (as  is  clear 
from  Dan.  xii.  &c.)  Wherefore  he  is  sent  to  announce  the  birth 
of  Christ,  who  was  to  carry  on  a most  severe  war  against  Lucifer, 
and  the  rest  of  the  demons  and  impious  men.  Again  Gabriel  in 
Hebrew  means  man  of  God ; the  meaning  of  which  is  that  God  will 
be  incarnate,  and  will  be  a child  as  to  nature  and  age ; but  yet  He 
will  also  be  a man,  because  from  the  first  instant  of  His  conception 
His  soul  will  be  full  of  all  knowledge,  grace,  and  strength,  according 
to  the  saying  of  Jer.  xxxi.  22,  a woman  shall  compass  a man 
Again,  Toletus,  following  Basil,  Dionysius,  and  others,  is  of  opinion 
that  Michael  was  one  of  the  principalities,  which  S.  Dionysius 
places  as  the  first  order  of  the  third  hierarchy  of  angels,  but  that 
Gabriel  was  of  the  order  of  archangels ; but  it  is  more  probable 
that  Michael  was  of  the  order  of  the  seraphim,  and  that  Gabriel  was 
next  to  him. 

Nazareth.  Whence  Christ  was  called  a Nazarene,  being,  as  it 
were,  the  country  in  which  he  was  conceived.  The  Blessed  Virgin 
therefore  dwelt  there  with  Joseph,  to  whom  she  was  betrothed. 
The  house  or  chamber  in  which  she  conceived  Christ  was  conse- 
crated by  S.  James  and  the  other  Apostles  as  a church.  After  three 
hundred  years  S.  Helen  built  a temple  there.  Also  S.  Paula,  S. 
Louis,  and  other  travellers  visited  it  After  a thousand  years  it  was

wanting  to  ns;  I prostrate  myself  at  thy  feet,  preserve  my  poor  soul, 
I beseech  thee." 

Ver.  27. — To  a Virgin  espoused  to  a many  &c.  Espoused,  not  by 
betrothal  only  bat  by  matrimony  already  contracted,  although  not 
actually  consummated,  see  Matt  L 18.  S.  Gregory  Thaumasius 
(Serm.  3 de  Annan.)  says,  “ Gabriel  is  sent  to  prepare  a chamber 
worthy  of  the  most  pure  Bridegroom;  he  is  sent  to  contract 
espousals  between  the  creature  and  the  Creator.”  Also  S.  Bernard 
(Serm.  1 de  Assump.)  well  says,  “ There  is  no  place  in  the  world  of 
greater  dignity  than  the  temple  of  the  virginal  womb  in  which 
Mary  conceived  the  Son  of  God,  nor  in  heaven  is  there  any  place 
of  higher  dignity  than  the  royal  throne  on  which  her  Son  has 
exalted  Mary."  And  in  Serm.  4,  “ What  angelic  purity  even  may  we 
venture  to  compare  with  that  virginity,  which  was  worthy  of  becom- 
ing the  shrine  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  the  abode  of  the  Son  of 
God." 

Mary.  In  Hebrew  Miriam,  that  is,  Mar  Yam , myrrh,  or  bitter- 
ness of  the  sea;  for  the  Hebrews  have  a tradition  that  the  sister  of 
Moses  was  called  Miriam,  because  when  she  was  born  the  bitter 
tyranny  of  Pharaoh  in  drowning  the  Hebrew  children  began.  But, 
by  the  Divine  will,  the  name  was  afterwards  changed  to  a different 
meaning,  for  after  the  Red  Sea  had  been  crossed  and  Pharaoh  had 
been  drowned,  she  was  called  Mariam  (Mara  Yam),  that  is  mistress 
of  the  sea;  for  as  Moses  was  the  leader  of  the  men,  so  Miriam 
was  the  leader  of  the  women  in  the  passage  of  the  Red  Sea. 
Moreover  she  was  a type,  says  S.  Ambrose,  of  the  Blessed  Virgin, 
who  is  called  Mary,  that  is  the  Mistress  and  Lady  of  the  sea  of  this 
world,  that  she  may  lead  us  through  it  in  safety  to  the  promised 
land,  that  is  heaven.  S.  Isidore  (viu  Etym.  cap . 10)  says,  “Mary 
is  by  interpretation  illuminator  or  star  of  the  sea ; for  she  brought 
forth  the  Light  of  the  world.  But  in  the  Syrian  language  Mary  is 
called  Lady,  because  she  brought  forth  the  Lord.” 

For  this  reason  Mary  was  full  of  grace,  and  a sea  of  graces ; for 
as  all  rivers  run  into  the  sea,  so  all  graces  which  angels,  patriarchs, 
apostles,  martyrs,  confessors,  virgins  possessed,  came  together  in  her,

as  S.  Bonaventura  says.  S.  Bridget  also  shows  in  her  Revelations , 
L 9,  how  delightful  the  name  of  Mary  is  to  the  angels,  and  how 
terrible  to  demons. 

And  the  angel  came  in  unto  her,  &c.  He  glided  into  the  chamber 
of  the  Virgin  as  she  was  praying  in  secret  for  the  advent  of  the 
Messiah  and  the  salvation  of  men,  either  through  the  window  or 
through  the  door.  For  angels,  since  they  are  most  pure  spirits,  by 
means  of  their  subtlety  pass  through  all  walls  and  bodies.  Although 
Andrew,  Bishop  of  Jerusalem,  in  a sermon  on  the  Annunciation, 
thinks  that  the  angel  secretly  opened  the  door  and  modestly  saluted 
the  Virgin. 

Hail,  Ave . It  is  very  probable  that  the  angel  used  the  ordinary 
salutation  of  the  Hebrews,  Peace  be  to  thee.  Unless 

the  opinion  of  Serarius  is  to  be  preferred,  that  ave  is  the  Hebrew 
mn  chave  or  have,  that  is,  " Live  \ ” so  that  there  is  an  allusion  to 
the  name  of  Eve,  which  is  in  Hebrew  HV7  chava , that  is  the  mother 
of  all  living  (Gen.  iii.  20),  so  that  the  meaning  will  be,  Eve  was  not 
the  mother  of  life  but  of  death,  because  by  sin  she  delivered  over 
all  her  children  to  death,  but  thou,  O Mary,  art  truly  called  Eve, 
because  thou  art  the  mother  of  life,  grace,  and  glory.  Hence  in 
Latin  ave  is  Eva  reversed,  because  Mary  turned  the  maledictions  of 
Eve  into  blessings. 

Highly  favoured . Gratia  plena,  Vulgate,  full  cf  grace . Greek, 
which  Beza  translates  gratis  dilecta,  freely  loved;  for  he 
thinks  that  the  just  have  no  inherent  and  intrinsic,  but  only  an 
extrinsic  righteousness,  which  consists  in  this,  that,  although  they 
be  sinners,  God  of  his  own  good  will  holds  and  reckons  them  as 
just ; which  is  heresy. 

But  xixa£irup**il  answers  to  the  Hebrew  112112,  filled  with  grace 
or  made  acceptable ; for  signifies  I make  acceptable,  I render 

beloved  or  dear,  1 dll  with  grace.  For  God  judges  nothing  to  be 
acceptable  except  what  is  truly  in  itself  acceptable ; wherefore  when 
He  makes  any  one  just  and  acceptable  to  Himself,  He  bestows  upon 
him  the  gift  of  justice  and  inherent  grace.  Wherefore 
is  the  same  as  full  of  grace:  as  it  is  rendered  in  our  version  and  the

THE  CHARACTER  OF  THE  BLESSED  VIRGIN. 


2! 


Syrian,  &c. ; also  by  S.  Ambrose  and  others  of  the  Fathers.  This 
word  therefore  signifies. — i.  That  the  Blessed  Virgin  had  a gift  of 
grace  bestowed  upon  her  by  God,  and  that,  in  a full  measure  of 
excellence  beyond  other  just  and  holy  persons,  for  this  epithet  is 
applied  solely  to  the  Blessed  Virgin,  to  the  end  that  she  might  be 
made  worthy  to  become  in  time  the  Mother  of  God.  2.  That  she  by 
means  of  this  gift  of  grace  was  wonderfully  well-pleasing  in  the  sight 
of  God  and  of  all  His  angels,  and  in  their  eyes  altogether  lovely  and 
beautiful,  so  that  Christ  chose  her  before  all  others  for  His  mother. 

You  will  say  that  Christ  was  more  full  of  grace  than  the  Blessed 
Virgin.  Others  also  of  the  saints  are  said  to  have  been  full  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  as  Stephen. 

I answer  that  they  are  said  to  have  been  full  of  grace,  but  in  dif- 
ferent ways.  For,  as  Maldonatus  rightly  says,  a fountain  is  full  of 
water,  so  is  a river,  so  are  streams,  although  there  is  more  water  and 
purer  in  a fountain  than  in  a river,  and  in  a river  than  in  streams. 
Christ  is  full  of  grace,  like  a fountain  where  grace  gushes  forth  and 
is  collected  as  in  a reservoir,  and  from  which  it  flows  forth  to  all 
men,  as  from  a head  to  the  members.  The  mother  of  Christ  is  full 
like  a river  very  near  a fountain,  which  although  it  has  less  water 
than  a fountain,  yet  flows  with  a full  channel.  Stephen  is  full  like 
a stream. 

S.  Augustine  (Serm  xviil  de  Sancius)  says,  “ Mary  is  filled  with 
grace,  and  Eve  is  made  clear  from  guilt ; the  curse  of  Eve  is  changed 
into  the  blessing  of  Mary.”  Toletus  (annotat.  67)  shows  that  the 
Blessed  Virgin  was  full  of  all  grace,  both  in  body  and  soul.  For  she 
was  free  from  concupiscence  (fomite  concupiscentia),  so  that  in  her 
the  flesh  was  subject  to  the  reason  and  the  spirit,  as  was  the  case 
with  Adam  in  Paradise  through  original  righteousness.  Wherefore 
he  adds  that  in  her,  nature  conspired  with  grace  and  co-operated  with 
it  in  every  respect  See  also  what  I have  said  concerning  her  in  the 
Commentary  on  the  Canticles,  especially  on  those  words  (c.  iv.  7), 
Thou  art  all  fair , my  love,  there  is  no  spot  in  thee . 

S.  Jerome  ( Serm . de  Assump.  B.  V.)  says,  “ It  is  well  said  that  she 
was  full  of  grace,  because  on  others  grace  is  bestowed  partially  (per

partes ),  but  the  fulness  of  grace  in  complete  treasure  was  infused 
into  Mary.”  And  again,  “ The  entire  fulness  of  grace,  which  is  in 
Christ,  came  upon  Mary,  although  in  a different  way.” 

Suarez  shows  that  the  grace  possessed  by  the  Blessed  Virgin  in 
the  first  instant  of  her  conception  was  greater  than  the  grace  which 
the  highest  angel  possesses,  who  by  one  or  two  acts  has  perfected 
all  his  merits,  and  therefore  she  merited  more  than  thousands  of  men 
merit  through  their  whole  life.  Wherefore  the  Blessed  Virgin  in  this 
first  instant  loved  and  praised  God  with  such  earnestness  of  inten- 
tion that  she  exceeded  the  love,  and  consequently  also  the  merit, 
of  the  highest  angel  But  in  the  second  instant  of  her  co-operation 
and  love,  by  means  of  the  increase  of  grace  which  in  the  first  instant 
she  had  merited  and  had  in  reality  received,  she  doubled  the  degrees 
of  love  and  consequently  also  of  merit ; and  in  the  third  instant,  by 
doubling  the  same  she  quadrupled  both  merit  and  grace ; and  so  in 
every  instant,  by  doubling  continually  the  grace  she  had  received, 
until  her  death  in  the  seventy-second  year  of  her  age,  she  had  in- 
creased the  degrees  of  grace  and  merit  to  such  an  extent  that  she 
altogether  excelled  in  them  all  men  and  angels  taken  together. 
Wherefore  she  by  herself  alone  is  more  acceptable  to  God  than  all 
the  rest ; and  God  loves  the  Blessed  Virgin  alone  more  than  the 
whole  Church,  that  is,  more  than  all  men  and  angels  taken  together. 
See  also  the  Revelations  of  S.  Bridget  L io. 

The  Lord  is  with  thee.  The  angel  gives  the  reason  why  she  was 
full  of  grace,  that  is,  because  the  Lord  was  with  her  in  a singular 
manner,  so  that  He  wrought  in  her  the  singular  work  of  the  Incarna- 
tion of  the  Word.  S.  Bernard  ( Semi,  3)  says,  “ What  wonder  is  it 
that  she  was  full  of  grace  with  whom  the  Lord  was  ? But  this  rather 
is  to  be  wondered  at,  how  He  who  had  sent  the  angel  to  the  Virgin 
was  found  by  the  angel  with  the  Virgin.  Was  God  then  swifter  than 
the  angel,  so  that  He  outstripped  him  and  reached  the  earth  before 
His  swift  messenger  ? Nor  is  it  to  be  wondered  at  For  since  the 
king  was  on  His  couch,  the  sweet  ointment  of  the  Virgin  gave  forth 
its  odour,  and  the  smoke  of  spices  went  up  in  the  sight  of  His  glory, 
and  she  found  grace  in  the  eyes  of  the  Lord.”  And  further  on  he

shows  that  God  is  in  all  creatures  by  power,  in  rational  beings  by 
knowledge,  in  the  good  by  love,  and  therefore  He  is  with  them  by 
concord  of  the  will,  for  it  is  by  means  of  this  that  they  unite  them- 
selves to  God.  Then  he  adds,  “ But  since  He  is  in  this  way  with  all 
the  saints,  yet  He  was  in  an  especial  manner  with  Mary,  between 
whom  and  Himself  there  was  such  a consent  that  He  joined  not  only 
her  will,  but  her  flesh  to  Himself,  and  of  His  own  and  the  Virgin’s 
substance  made  one  Christ ; who  although  He  is  not  wholely  of  God 
nor  wholely  of  the  Virgin,  yet  He  is  wholely  God’s  and  wholely  the 
Virgin’s,  and  not  two  sons,  but  the  one  son  of  both.”  Then  he 
shows  that  the  whole  Trinity  was  with  the  Blessed  Virgia  “ Not 
only  is  the  Lord  the  Son  with  thee  whom  thou  art  clothing  with  thy 
flesh,  but  also  the  Lord  the  Spirit  by  Whom  thou  art  conceiving,  and 
the  Lord  the  Father  who  begat  Him  whom  thou  art  conceiving.” 

S.  Bridget  (Revel,  iil  29),  conversing  with  the  Blessed  Virgin,  says, 
“ Thou  art  made  like  to  the  Temple  of  Solomon,  in  which  the  true 
Solomon  moves,  and  He  sits  who  has  made  peace  between  God  and 
man.  Blessed  therefore  art  thou,  O Blessed  Virgin,  in  whom  the 
great  God  became  a little  child,  the  eternal  God  and  invisible 
Creator  became  a visible  creature.”  The  Blessed  Virgin  answers, 
“Why  do  you  compare  me  with  Solomon  and  his  Temple,  since  I 
am  the  mother  of  Him  Who  has  neither  beginning  nor  end,  for  the 
Son  of  God,  Who  is  my  Son,  is  Priest  and  King  of  kings.  In  short, 
in  my  Temple  He  clothed  Himself  spiritually  with  the  priestly 
garments  in  which  He  offered  sacrifice  for  the  world.” 

Further  S.  Thomas  (Quasi,  tool,  art . 4)  expounds  the  words  the  Lord 
is  with  thee  of  the  Conception  and  Incarnation  of  the  Word,  which 
was  presently  to  take  place,  but  which  had  not  already  taken  place ; 
as  I shall  show  at  verse  38. 

Blessed  art  thou  among  women.  The  same  was  said  of  Jael  and 
Judith,  but  it  is  said  here  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  in  a far  more 
excellent  way,  for  she  excelled  Jael  and  Judith,  and  all  virgins  and 
matrons  a thousand  times  in  blessings,  gifts,  and  graces. 

S.  Augustine  (Scrm.  18  de  Sanctis)  says,  “ Blessed  art  thou  among 
women,  for  thou  hast  brought  forth  life  both  for  men  and  women

S.  LUKE,  C.  I. 


The  mother  of  our  race  brought  punishment  into  the  world;  the 
Mother  of  our  Lord  brought  salvation  to  the  world.  Eve  was  the 
originator  of  sin,  Mary  of  merit.”  Peter  Chrysologus  (Serm.  145) 
says  on  these  words,  “She  was  truly  blessed,  for  she  was  greater 
than  the  heaven,  stronger  than  the  earth,  wider  than  the  world;  she 
by  herself  alone  contained  God,  whom  the  world  contains  not ; she 
bore  Him  Who  bears  the  world ; she  brought  forth  Him  by  Whom 
she  had  been  begotten,  she  gives  nourishment  to  the  Nourisher  of 
all  things  living.” 

Among  women.  That  he  might  signify  that  whatever  is  most 
excellent  in  the  threefold  condition  of  women  is  found  in  the 
Blessed  Virgin.  For  women  are  either  virgins  or  widows,  or  living 
in  matrimony.  In  virgins  chastity  is  praised,  but  not  barrenness ; 
in  widows  liberty  of  mind  is  commended,  but  not  solitude,  for  it  is 
written  (Eccles.  iv.  10)  “Woe  to  him  that  is  alone,  for  when  he 
falleth  he  hath  not  one  to  lift  him  up.”  In  matrimony  the  educa- 
tion of  offspring  in  what  is  good  is  highly  esteemed,  but  not  the  loss 
of  Virginity.  The  Blessed  Virgin  alone  among  all  women  possessed 
virginity  without  barrenness ; liberty  of  mind  without  loss  of  com- 
panionship, since  she  was  really  espoused  to  Joseph;  and  what  is  a 
greater  thing  than  these,  fruitfulness  in  offspring  without  the  vio- 
lation of  virgin  chastity.  And  so  she  appropriated  whatever  is  good 
in  the  threefold  state  of  women,  and  whatever  is  evil  she  rejected. 
Whereupon  deservedly  the  angel  proclaims  her  Blessed  above  all 
women. 

Ver  29. — She  was  troubled.  First,  at  the  unwonted  appearance, 
brightness,  and  majesty  of  the  angel  Secondly,  at  his  unwonted 
salutation.  S.  Jerome  (Epist.  7)  says,  “ Let  a woman  imitate  Mary, 
whom  Gabriel  found  alone  in  her  chamber,  and  therefore,  perhaps, 
she  was  alarmed  at  beholding  a man  whom  she  was  not  accustomed 
to  see.”  Again  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  iil  on  Missus  Est)  says,  “She  was 
troubled,  but  not  alarmed ; her  being  troubled  was  a mark  of 
modesty ; her  not  being  alarmed  of  courage ; while  her  keeping  silence 
and  meditating  was  a mark  of  prudence.” 

What  manner  of  salutation.  That  is,  how  noble  and  august,  and

exceeding  the  strength  and  merits  of  all  men,  and  therefore  even 
her  own.  For  she,  in  the  greatness  of  her  humility,  thought  far 
different,  yea,  even  contrary  things  of  herself.  For  she  thought 
within  herself ; I seem  to  myself  to  be  in  need  of  all  grace,  how 
then  does  the  angel  call  me  full  of  grace,  I in  my  poverty  live  and 
associate  with  poor  virgins,  how  then  does  the  angel  proclaim  to  me 
that  the  Lard  is  with  me.  I esteem  myself  the  least  and  lowest  of 
all  women,  how  then  does  the  angel  say  to  me,  Blessed  art  thou 
among  women. 

Again,  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  meditating  to  what  end  she  was  so 
honourably  saluted  by  the  angel ; for  the  salutation  of  the  angel  had 
reference  to  the  mysteiy  of  the  Incarnation  which  was  to  be  accom- 
plished in  her.  But  since  she  knew  not  of  this  end,  she  meditated 
and  wondered  why  she  was  so  honourably  saluted  by  the  angel. 
However,  she  made  no  answer,  because,  as  S.  Ambrose  says,  “she 
did  not  return  the  salutation  through  modesty,  nor  did  she  make 
any  answer;”  because  modesty  and  astonishment  fully  occupied 
her  mind,  and  restrained  her  tongue. 

Listen  again  to  S.  Ambrose,  “ Know  the  Virgin  by  her  modesty : 
or  she  was  afraid  ; as  it  follows,  and  when  she  heard  she  was  troubled. 
It  is  the  habit  of  virgins  to  tremble  and  to  be  afraid  at  the  approach 
of  a man,  and  to  be  bashful  when  he  addresses  her.  Learn,  O virgin, 
to  avoid  lightness  in  talking.  Mary  feared  even  the  salutation  of 
an  angel. 

Ver.  30. — And  the  angel  said  unto  her , &c.  The  angel  removes 
the  fear,  and  then  the  rising  shame  of  the  Virgin,  by  the  grace,  that 
is,  the  favour  and  goodwill  which  he  says  she  has  found  in  the  eyes 
of  God  above  all  women;  first,  because  God  chose  her  from  all 
eternity  above  all  others  without  merit,  and  of  His  free  and  gratui- 
tous love  to  be  His  Mother,  of  whom  he  would  take  flesh  : secondly, 
because  as  soon  as  she  was  conceived  and  bom  in  time,  He  so 
adorned  her  with  every  virtue  and  grace  that  in  His  sight  she 
appeared  altogether  pleasing  and  worthy  to  be  loved  by  Him,  and 
exalted  above  alL  Thou  hast  therefore  found  favour  with  God  on 
account  of  the  virtues  infused  into  thee  by  Him  in  a most  excellent

degree.  The  first  is  thy  most  profound  humility : the  second  was  thy 
angelic  virginity.  S.  Basil,  in  his  homily  on  the  human  generation 
of  Christ,  says,  “Virginity  is  chosen,  as  being  fit  and  next  to 
sanctity.” 

The  third  virtue  was  her  most  ardent  charity,  by  which  the  Blessed 
Virgin,  being  desirous  of  the  redemption  of  mankind  and  the  Advent 
of  the  Messiah,  used  to  pour  forth  unceasing  and  fervent  prayers  for 
both,  and  therefore  she  obtained  both,  and,  further,  merited  herself 
to  become  the  mother  of  the  Messiah,  not  from  grace  of  condignity 
but  of  congruity.  So  S.  Bernard  (Ham.  3 super  Missus  Est\  " Thou 
hast  found  what  thou  wast  seeking.  Thou  hast  found  what  no  one 
before  thee  was  able  to  find.  Thou  hast  found  favour  with  God. 
What  favour?  Peace  between  God  and  man,  the  destruction  of 
death,  the  restoration  of  life.”  The  Schoolmen  everywhere  teach 
that  the  Blessed  Virgin  merited  to  become  the  Mother  of  God. 
See  Suarez.  And  some  teach  that  she  merited  of  congruity  not  of 
condignity  to  become  the  Mother  of  God,  yet  that  she  did  not  merit 
the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  ; for  this  is  antecedent  to  all  merit,  and 
is  the  cause  and  origin  of  it. 

Ver.  31. — Behold,  thou  shalt  conceive.  The  angel  shows  that  Mary 
found  favour  with  God  because  she  is  about  to  conceive  and  bring 
forth  Jesus,  that  is,  God  and  man.  He  alludes  to  and  also  quotes 
the  prophecy,  Isa.  vii.  14. 

Hence  then  is  refuted,  first,  the  Manichsean,  who  says  that  Christ 
did  not  take  real  flesh  of  the  Virgin,  but  only  the  appearance  of 
flesh ; for  a son  who  is  conceived  in  the  womb  and  brought  forth  is 
a real  son,  and  not  one  in  appearance  only  : secondly,  Valentinus, 
who  teaches  that  Christ  brought  flesh  from  heaven,  and  merely 
passed  through  the  Blessed  Virgin,  as  water  passes  through  a 
channel ; thirdly,  Nestorius,  who  asserts  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  was 
not  the  Mother  of  God  because  she  was  not  the  Mother  of  the 
Divinity ; to  whom  Cyril  well  replies  that  she  is  truly  the  Mother  of 
God  although  she  did  not  bring  forth  His  Divinity,  but  His  humanity 
only,  because  she  brought  forth  the  Man,  namely  Jesus,  Who  is 
truly  God  : as  a father  is  truly  called  the  father  of  his  son,  although

he  does  not  beget  his  soul,  but  only  his  flesh,  because  he  begets  a 
man  who  consists  of  soul  and  flesh. 

Yer.  32. — He  shall  be  great , &c.  Great  both  as  God  and  as  man. 
And  He  shall  be  called  the  Son  of  the  Highest ; that  is  through  the 
hypostatic  onion.  He  can  and  ought  of  right  to  be  called  the  Son 
of  God. 

Ver.  33. — And  He  shall  reign  over  the  house  of  Jacob . That  i$ 
over  the  Church,  as  Bede  and  others  say.  This  kingdom  in  David 
was  a temporal  one,  but  in  Christ  a spiritual  and  eternal  one,  be- 
cause He  reigns  over  His  saints  here  by  grace,  and  in  heaven  He 
will  reign  over  them  in  glory.  See  what  I have  said  on  the  king- 
dom of  Christ,  Matt  xxvii.  1 1. 

Yer.  34. — And  Mary  said  to  the  angel \ &c  The  Virgin  had  no 
doubt  concerning  the  truth  of  the  prophesy  and  promise  of  the 
angel,  as  Calvin  blasphemously  asserts,  but  she  was  anxious  as  to 
the  manner  of  its  fulfilment,  lest  the  conception  of  a son  should 
involve  a loss  of  virginity,  and  a breaking  of  the  vow  which  she  had 
made  concerning  it  So  S.  Ambrose,  Augustine,  &c. 

We  may  learn  here  how  great  was  the  zeal  and  love  for  virginity 
which  the  Blessed  Virgin  had,  because,  as  Nyssen  says,  “she  pre- 
ferred chastity  to  the  angelic  tidings ; and  preferred  being  a virgin 
to  being  absolutely  the  Mother  of  God,  as  S.  Anselm  says.  For 
virginity  is  in  itself  a virtue  most  pleasing  to  God,  while  maternity 
is  not  so  absolutely.  I say  absolutely ; for  in  other  respects  mater- 
nity is  an  incomprehensible  dignity  bestowed  by  God  (as  God 
Himself  is  incomprehensible)  and  an  abyss  of  all  graces.  For  on 
account  of  this  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  endowed  with  more  than 
angelic  virginity,  humility,  charity,  and  other  virtues,  that  she  might 
be  worthy  to  become  the  Mother  of  God.  So  S.  Augustine,  S. 
Thomas,  &c. 

Wherefore  Bede  says,  that  by  a divine  gift  it  was  granted  to  her 
first  among  women  to  make  an  offering  of  her  virginity  to  God. 
And  Albertus  Magnus  {super  Missus  Est \ c.  82)  says,  “The  Blessed 
Virgin  is  the  mother  of  all  who  are  in  virginity,  since  she  was  the 
first  to  make  an  offering  of  her  virginity  to  God,  through  which

offering  she  became  the  mother  of  all  virgins.”  Wherefore  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  being  most  anxious  concerning  her  virginity  and 
the  vow  she  had  made  with  respect  to  it,  makes  mention  of  it  as  it 
were  by  way  of  objection  to  the  angel  For  there  was  a conflict 
in  her  between  the  desire  of  conceiving  the  Son  of  God  and  the 
fear  of  losing  her  virginity : and  therefore  she  obtained  both.  The 
sense  therefore  is  : “ I surely  believe  that  I shall  conceive  and  bring 
forth  Jesus,  the  Son  of  God,  but  I am  doubtful  as  to  the  way  in 
which  this  will  be.  I know  not  a man,  because  I have  made  a vow 
of  virginity : if  God  wishes  to  dispense  with  this  vow,  though  it  be 
hard,  yet  I will  obey  the  will  of  God  : but  if  He  seeks  to  know  my 
desire,  I certainly  declare  that  I earnestly  desire  to  preserve  the 
virginity  that  I have  vowed  to  Him  : for  He  who  is  a most  pure  spirit, 
and  therefore  the  first  virgin,  has  Himself  put  it  into  my  mind ; and 
it  will  be  honourable  to  my  Son  Jesus  if  He  is  born  of  a virgin. 
For  I know  what  has  been  foretold  by  Isaiah,  Behold  a virgin  shall 
conceive , and  shall  bring  forth  Emmanuel ; and  it  may  be  the  will  of 
God  that  I should  be  that  virgin.  If  it  is  so,  be  it  so.”  Whence 
on  hearing  immediately  from  Gabriel  that  she  would  conceive  not 
by  a man,  but  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  she  immediately  breaks  forth 
with  great  joy  of  heart,  Behold  the  handmaid  of  the  Lord ; be  it 
unto  me  according  to  thy  word.  And  it  was  this  word  that  God 
wished  to  hear,  so  that  through  the  profession  of  her  virginity  she 
might  merit  to  become  the  Son  of  God. 

Ver.  35. — And  the  Angel  answered  ...  the  Holy  Ghost  shall 
come  upon  thee , &c.  Mark  here  that  the  Incarnation  is  limited  only 
to  the  Person  of  the  Word,  or  Son  of  God:  for  He  alone  was 
incarnate  and  made  man,  and  not  the  Father  nor  the  Holy  Spirit : 
and  yet  the  incarnation  was  the  work  of  the  whole  Trinity,  as  its 
efficient  cause  and  not  only  of  the  Son.  Yet  this  work  of  the 
Incarnation  is  appropriated  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  first,  because  it 
was  a most  holy  work;  secondly,  because  the  works  relating  to 
our  redemption,  and  those  which  most  display  God’s  goodness  are 
appropriated  to  the  Holy  Spirit,  because  He  proceeds  forth  as  the 
ideal  love  of  the  Father  and  the  Son : in  the  same  way  wisdom

THE  CONCEPTION  OF  CHRIST.

is  appropriated  to  the  Son  as  the  Word,  and  omnipotence  to  the 
Father  as  the  first  principle  and  origin.  Moreover,  the  Holy 
Spirit  was  the  framer  of  the  humanity  of  Christ,  because  He 
fashioned  and  animated  it,  but  He  cannot  be  called  its  Father, 
because  He  did  not  contribute  or  communicate  anything  to  it  of 
His  own  substance.  S.  Augustine  (Enchirid.  c.  28). 

Further  S.  Cyril  ( Catcch . 12)  shows  that  a virgin  by  the  power 
of  God  could  conceive  and  bring  forth ; and  first,  in  arguing  with 
the  Gentiles,  he  says,  “ How  is  it  that  ye,  who  say  that  stones 
when  thrown  were  changed  into  men,  maintain  that  a virgin  cannot 
bring  forth  ? How  is  it  that  ye,  who  fable  that  a daughter  was 
bom  out  of  the  head  of  Jupiter,  maintain  that  it  is  impossible  that 
one  can  be  bora  of  a virgin’s  womb?”  And  then,  arguing  with 
the  Jews,  he  says,  “Sara  was  barren,  and  she  brought  forth  a 
child  beyond  the  way  of  nature  at  an  age  when  women  have  lost 
the  power  (to  do  so) : either  then  deny  both,  or  grant  both,  for 
the  same  God  was  the  worker  of  both.”  He  further  says,  that 
God  out  of  the  virgin  Adam  formed  a virgin  woman,  namely  Eve ; 
why  could  He  not  then  in  like  manner  form  a virgin  man  out  of 
a virgin  woman  ? 

Shall  come  upon  thee.  In  order  that  the  conception  of  Christ, 
and  Christ  Himself,  might  be  holy,  not  only  by  reason  of  the 
hypostatic  union  with  the  Word,  but  also  by  reason  of  so  divine 
a conception,  for  He  was  conceived  not  by  a man  or  an  angel, 
but  by  the  Holy  Ghost  Wherefore  Christ,  by  virtue  of  this  con- 
ception, was  not  the  son  of  Adam,  so  as  to  derive  original  sin  from 
him,  and  be  bora  a sinner,  as  we  all  are  born,  but  He  was  most 
pure  and  most  holy. 

Again  Christ  was  conceived  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  because  it  was 
fitting,  since  He  was  both  God  and  man,  that  both  should  be 
recognised  in  the  conception.  For  the  conception  itself  declares 
that  He  was  Man ; for  He  would  not  have  been  conceived  unless 
He  had  been  man ; and  the  manner  of  the  conception  shows  that 
He  was  also  God;  for  to  be  conceived  by  a virgin  without  a 
husband,  shows  that  He  who  was  conceived  was  more  than  man*

S.  LUKE,  C.  I. 


Mystically,  S.  Cyril  of  Jerusalem  ( Catech . 12)  says,  the  Lord  willed 
to  be  bom  of  a virgin,  to  signify  that  His  members  would  be  bom 
according  to  the  Spirit  of  the  Church,  which  is  a virgin. 

Lactantius  gives  another  reason,  which  is  that  Christ,  Who  in 
heaven  is  without  a mother , might  be  on  earth  a*ar*£f 

without  a father.  But  the  first  reason  is  the  chief  one,  namely,  that 
Christ  might  be  bom  without  original  sin. 

Proclus  (Horn,  de  Naiiv.)  says,  “ Mary  is  both  handmaid  and 
mother,  both  virgin  and  heaven  itself.  She  is  the  one  bridge  by 
which  God  comes  down  to  man.  She  is  the  wonderful  web  of 
that  economy,  of  whom  and  in  whom,  in  a certain  ineffable  manner, 
the  admirable  fabric  of  that  union  was  wrought,  of  which  the  Holy 
Spirit  was  the  weaver,  the  power  overshadowing  from  on  high  was 
the  spinner ; the  wool  was  the  old  and  rough  garment  of  Adam ; 
the  woof  was  the  pure  flesh  of  the  Virgin;  the  weaver’s  shuttle 
was  the  immeasurable  grace  of  her  who  was  with  child;  the 
artificer  was  the  Word  which  passed  in  through  the  hearing.” 

The  power  of  the  Highest \ &c.  According  to  Euthymius  and 
Maldonatus,  the  power  of  the  Highest  is  the  Holy  Spirit,  Who 
with  power  brings  the  holy  works  of  God  to  perfection,  so  that 
these  words  are  an  explanation  of  what  the  angel  had  said,  the 
Holy  Ghost  shall  come  upon  thee.  So  Christ  (cap.  xxiv.  49)  says  to 
the  Apostles,  Tarry  in  this  city  ( Jerusalem ) until  ye  be  endued  with 
power  from  on  high,  i.e.  with  the  Holy  Spirit  This  it  is  of  which 
the  Church  speaks,  “ Almighty  and  everlasting  God,  Who  by  the 
co-operation  of  the  Holy  Spirit  didst  prepare  the  body  and  soul 
of  the  glorious  Virgin  Mother  Mary  that  she  might  be  worthy  to 
be  made  a fit  habitation  for  thy  Son.” 

Shall  overshadow  thee.  S.  Gregory  (33  Moral  c.  2)  explains  thus, 
“ The  Word  of  God  in  thee  will  assume  a body,  which  will  be  as  it 
were  a shadow  of  Deity,  for  it  will  as  a shadow  veil  and  conceal 
It.”  And  again  he  says  (18  Moral.  12),  “The  human  body  in  thee 
shall  receive  the  incorporeal  light  of  Divinity.”  Origen  says  also, 
that  the  Body  of  Christ  is  called  a shadow,  because  in  the  Passion 
it  was  humiliated  and  obscured  after  the  manner  of  a shadow.

THE  SON  OF  GOD. 


31 


S.  Ambrose  (on  Psalm  119)  understands  by  the  shadow  this 
present  and  mortal  life  which  the  Spirit  gave  to  Christ,  for  this  is, 
as  it  were,  a shadow  of  the  true  life  and  of  eternity. 

S.  Augustine  (Quasi.  V.  et  N.  T c.  15)  says,  The  power  of  the 
Highest  shall  overshadow  thee , i.e.  shall  attemper  itself  to  thee,  as  a 
shadow  adjusts  itself  to  a body,  for  thy  human  weakness  could  not 
contain  the  fulness  of  its  force  and  power. 

But  more  simply,  the  meaning  is,  It  will  cover  thee  as  with  a veil, 
i.e.,  will  secretly  work  a mighty  operation  in  thee ; for  it  will  be 
such  and  so  great  a one  that  no  man  or  angel  can  penetrate  into  or 
comprehend  it  For,  first,  it  will  form  in  thee  the  perfect  humanity 
of  Christ ; and,  secondly,  it  will  unite  the  same  in  a certain  ineffable 
manner  to  the  Person  of  the  Word. 

Again,  to  overshadow  may  be  taken  as  answering  to  the  Hebrew 
word  py,  to  cover  with  a cloud \ and  so  to  rain  upon , for  a cloud 
pours  forth  rain,  and  hence  by  the  shadow  and  the  cloud  is 
signified  rain,  which  is  poured  forth  from  the  cloud  and  renders 
the  earth  fruitful  An  allusion  seems  to  be  made  to  Psalm 
IxxiL  6,  He  shall  come  down  like  the  rain  into  a fleece  of 
wool 

Wherefore  that  Holy  Thing  which  shall  be  bom  of  Thee  shall  be 
called  the  Son  of  God.  Because  the  Holy  Spirit  will  come  upon 
thee,  and  cause  thee  to  conceive  a son,  the  Son  which  shall  be  born 
of  thee  will  be  holy  from  His  very  conception,  yea,  the  Holy  of 
Holies,  because  He  will  be  called,  and  through  His  hypostatic 
union  with  the  Word  will  truly  be,  the  natural  and  Only  Begotten 
Son  of  God,  and  will  be  called  so  by  God,  by  angels,  and  by  men ; 
for  He  who  is  conceived  by  the  Holy  Spirit  must  needs  be  most 
Holy.  Maldonatus  somewhat  differently  says,  “ Jesus  is  called  the 
Son  of  God,  because  He  will  not  be  begotten  as  the  rest  of  men 
are,  but  by  God  through  the  power  of  the  Spirit,  and  therefore  He 
will  be  holy,  and  the  Son  of  God.”  So  (Luke  iil  38)  Adam  is 
called  the  Son  of  God,  because  he  was  created  not  by  man  but  by 
God. 

He  says,  That  Holy  Thing , not  Man,  to  show  that  this  Son  will

not  be  a mere  man,  but  besides  being  a man  will  also  be  God  (S. 
Greg,  xviii.  Moral ’ c . 27) ; and  also  to  declare  that  Jesus  will  be  holy 
with  a holiness  altogether  perfect  and  natural  on  account  of  the  hypo- 
static union  (Suarez,  m.p.  disp.  18  sect.  1) : so  that  the  meaning  is,  Jesus, 
Who  will  be  bom  of  thee,  will  be  Most  Holy,  yea,  Holiness  itself. 

S.  Bernard  (Serm.  4 super  Missus  Est)  says,  u Why  does  he  say 
merely  that  Holy  Thing , and  no  more  ? Because  there  was  not  any 
proper  or  worthy  expression  that  he  could  use.  If  he  had  said  that 
holy  flesh,  or  that  holy  man,  or  whatever  expression  of  such  a kind 
he  had  used,  he  would  have  seemed  to  himself  to  have  said  but  little. 
He  uses,  therefore,  the  indefinite  expression,  That  Holy  Thing; 
because  whatever  it  was  that  the  Virgin  brought  forth,  It  was  with- 
out doubt  holy  and  in  a singular  manner  holy,  both  through  the 
sanctification  of  the  Spirit  and  the  assumption  of  the  Word.” 

The  Son  of  God  by  nature,  Who  would  make  all  the  faithful,  sons 
of  God  by  grace. 

Ver.  36. — And,  behold ',  thy  cousin  Elizabeth.  The  angel  confirms 
the  miracle  of  the  coming  birth  of  Jesus  of  the  Virgin  and  the  Holy 
Spirit  by  the  similar  miracle  of  the  conception  of  John  by  Elizabeth 
who  was  barren.  At  the  same  time  he  silently  admonishes  the 
Blessed  Virgin  that  she  should  visit  John  and  Elizabeth,  and  fill 
them  with  the  Holy  Spirit  by  saluting  them. 

For  with  God  nothing  shall  be  impossible  (Vulgate,  non  omne 
verbum , no  word , which  is  a Hebraism),  i.e.  nothing,  however  diffi- 
cult or  incredible  to  man ; or,  as  others  take  it,  no  word,  ie.  no 
promise ; which  means  that  God  is  able  to  perform  all  things  that 
He  has  promised,  because  He  is  omnipotent ; and  He  will  really 
perform  them  because  He  is  faithful.  He  says  word,  because  it  is 
as  easy  to  God  to  do  a thing  as  it  is  to  us  to  speak  a word,  and  because 
He  spake  a word  only  and  all  things  were  made.  “ Inasmuch  as,” 
says  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  4 on  Missus  Est),  “ with  God  neither  does  His 
word  fall  short  of  His  intention,  because  He  is  Truth ; nor  His  deed 
fall  short  of  His  word,  because  He  is  Power ; nor  the  manner  (in 
which  the  deed  is  done)  fall  short  of  the  deed,  because  He  is  Wisdom.” 
“ God,”  says  S.  Augustine  (lib.  5 de  Civ.  c.  10),  " can  do  all  things

except  those  things  which  to  be  able  to  do  is  a mark  not  of  power, 
but  of  weakness ; and  which  if  he  were  able  to  do  He  would  not  be 
omnipotent ; such  as  to  die,  to  deceive,  to  err,  to  sin.” 

The  angel  stood,  and  was  silent,  eagerly  expecting  the  answer  and 
consent  of  the  Virgin.  Whence  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  4,  super  Missus  Est) 
says,  that  Adam  and  all  the  patriarchs  and  prophets,  being  anxious 
concerning  the  coming  of  the  Messiah  and  the  salvation  of  men, 
were  waiting  for  this  consent ; and  he  adds  “ the  whole  world,  pros- 
trate at  thy  knees,  is  waiting  for  this : and  rightly,  since  on  thy  words 
depend  the  consolation  of  the  miserable,  the  redemption  of  the 
captives,  the  liberation  of  the  damned,  the  salvation,  in  short,  of  all 
the  sons  of  Adam.  Make  answer,  O Virgin,  speedily,  speak  the 
word  which  earth,  which  the  dwellers  below  and  the  dwellers  on 
high  are  waiting  for.  The  King  and  Lord  of  all  things  Himself 
desires  thine  assent,  by  which  His  purpose  is  to  save  the  world." 

Ver.  38. — And  Mary  said ' &c.  Mark  the  humility,  modesty,  and 
resignation  of  the  Virgin,  for  though  saluted  by  the  angel  as  Mother 
of  God,  she  calls  herself  His  handmaid,  not  His  mother ; handmaid 
by  nature,  mother  by  grace.  Pet  Dam.  (Serm.  3 de  Nativ.  Virg.) 
And  S.  Bernard  ( Serm,  in  Apoc.  12)  says,  “A  great  sign:  deservedly 
is  she  made  mistress  of  all  who  declared  herself  servant  ofall.i} 

Be  it  unto  me  (Biot).  This  word  shows  that  she  consented  and 
yielded  her  assent  to  the  angel  with  respect  to  the  conception  of 
the  Word ; also  that  she  wished,  desired,  and  earnestly  prayed  for 
the  Incarnation  of  the  Messiah,  so  that  He  might  redeem  and  save 
mankind.  For  this  the  Blessed  Virgin  most  ardently  desired  and 
prayed  for.  “ Be  it  so,  is  a mark  of  desire,  not  a sign  of  doubt* 
S.  Bernard  (Serm.  4 sup.  Missus  Est). 

There  is  a question  at  what  precise  moment  the  Son  of  God  became 
incarnate.  1.  Andrew  * of  Crete  is  of  opinion  that  He  was  incarnate 
before  the  angel  came  to  the  Blessed  Viigin.  For  his  words,  the 
Lord  is  with  thee f clearly  signify  that  the  King  Himself  had  come. 

* Elias  is  written  by  error  for  Andrew,  and  many,  if  not  all  his  editors,  have 
followed  k Lapide.  The  passage  referred  to  is  found  in  the  sermon  of  Andrew 
of  Crete  on  the  Annunciation.

2.  Nicephorus  maintains  that  Christ  became  incarnate  when  the 
angel  saluted  her  and  said  Hail,  thou  art  full  of  grace  (Lib.  i.  c.  8). 
S.  Jerome  (Ep.  140)  and  S.  Gregory  Thaumaturgus  favour  this  opinion. 

3.  Others  appear  to  think  that  He  became  incarnate  when  the 
Angel  said  The  Lord  is  with  thee.  S.  Augustine  (Serm.  2 de  Annunc.) 
and  S.  Thomas  (3  p.  qu.  30  art.  4)  and  others  so  explain  it 

But  these  opinions  cannot  be  true ; because  the  angel  after  the 
Hail,  &c.  adds,  Behold \ thou  shall  conceive  in  thy  womb  ; therefore  she 
had  not  yet  conceived.  Again  the  Blessed  Virgin  giving  her  assent 
to  the  angel  says,  Be  it  unto  me  according  to  thy  word;  therefore  it 
had  not  yet  taken  place. 

I say  then  that  the  Word  was  incarnate  as  soon  as  the  Blessed 
Virgin  had  given  her  assent  to  the  angel ; for  he  was  sent  for  this 
purpose ; for  it  was  not  fitting  that  Christ  should  be  conceived  with- 
out the  consent  or  knowledge  of  His  Virgin  Mother ; as  soon  then 
as  she  had  spoken  the  words,  Behold  the  handmaid  of  the  Lord \ Be  it 
unto  me  according  to  thy  word , the  Holy  Spirit  formed  the  Body  of 
Christ,  and  joined  It  Hypostatically  to  the  Word,  or  Person  of  the 
Son  of  God ; in  the  same  way  as  when  the  priest  in  consecration 
says,  This  is  my  Body , by  the  power  of  these  words  the  bread  is 
transubstantiated  into  the  Body  of  Christ.  This  again  is  clear  from 
the  fact  that  as  soon  as  the  Virgin  had  given  her  consent  the  angel, 
having,  as  it  were,  fulfilled  his  mission,  departed  from  her.  It  is  con- 
firmed too  by  the  fact  that  soon  after  the  Blessed  Virgin  had  said 
Be  it  unto  me,  &c.,  when  she  saluted  Elizabeth,  being  saluted  by  her 
in  return  she  was  called  the  Mother  of  the  Lord,  i.e.  of  Christ  Who 
is  God.  The  Virgin,  therefore,  when  she  said,  Be  it  unto  me,  &c.,  was 
made  as  it  were  the  spouse  of  God,  and  our  flesh  was  made  the 
spouse  of  the  Word. 

To  those  who  maintain  a contrary  opinion  it  may  be  replied — 1. 
that  Andrew  of  Crete  seems  to  have  been  of  an  opposite  opinion, 
but  that  he  was  alone  in  maintaining  it ; for  the  rest  contradict  him. 
2.  That  Nicephorus  by  the  words  Hail,  &c.,  understands  the  whole 
of  the  salutation  and  annunciation  made  by  the  angel,  at  the  end  of 
which  the  Word  was  made  flesh.  3.  S.  Augustine,  S.  Thomas,  and

The  Blessed  Virgin  in  the  conception  of  the  Son  received  an 
extraordinary  increase  of  grace  and  perfect  sanctification ; and  this, 
says  Suarez,  may  not  be  doubted  without  temerity.  Whence  Bede 
(Horn.  de.  Visit.)  says,  “ Who  can  say  or  measure  what  grace  then 
filled  the  spirit  of  the  Mother  of  God,  when  so  great  a light  from 
heaven  shone  forth  in  the  mother  of  His  forerunner  ? ” S.  Bernard 
gives  a reason  for  this  ( VoL  i,  condus.  61,  art  i,  cap.  12),  “ In  order 
that  God  should  generate  God,  no  especial  arrangement  was  needed 
on  the  part  of  God,  since  according  to  His  nature  it  was  fitting  that 
in  the  way  of  nature  His  intellect  should  produce  the  Word,  in  all 
things  equal  to  Himself;  but  that  a woman  should  conceive  and 
bring  forth  God  is  and  was  a miracle  ; for  there  was  a necessity,  so 
to  say,  that  she  should  be  raised  to  a certain  divine  equality  by  means 
of  a certain  quasi-infinity  of  perfections  and  graces,  which  equality 
no  creature  had  ever  experienced.  Whence,  as  I believe,  no  human 
or  angelic  intellect  has  ever  been  able  to  attain  to  that  inscrutable 
abyss  of  all  gifts  of  the  Holy  Spirit  which  descended  on  the  Blessed 
Virgin  in  the  hour  of  the  Divine  conception.” 

And  the  angel  departed  from  her.  The  Blessed  Virgin  made 
known  to  some  that  Gabriel  did  not  depart  immediately,  but  stayed 
with  her  for  nine  hours,  being  overcome  with  astonishment  at  the 
Incarnation  of  the  Word  in  her,  and  that  he  adored  the  Word 
incarnate ; as  if  rapt  in  admiration  at  the  incredible  modesty  and 
majesty  of  the  Virgin,  he  were  unable  to  depart  (The  records 
of  S.  George  in  Alga  in  Lusitania  mention  this  tradition.)  But 
though  this  is  a pious  tradition  it  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  certainly 
true. 

Ver.  39. — And  Mary  arose  in  those  days.  Not  on  the  same  day 
on  which  she  was  saluted  by  the  angel,  but  after  two  or  three  days. 
What  was  the  reason  of  her  going  away?  1.  That  she  might 
announce  the  conception  of  the  Word  to  others.  For  Christ 
having  become  incarnate  in  her,  willed  immediately  to  begin  His

mission  as  a Saviour,  for  which  He  had  been  sent  by  the  Father. 
Whence  S.  Ambrose  says,  “She  departed,  not  as  disbelieving  in 
the  oracle,  or  as  uncertain  about  the  messenger,  or  doubtful  of  the 
example,  but  as  rejoicing  in  the  fulfilment  of  her  wish,  conscientious 
in  the  performance  of  her  duty,  and  hastening  on  account  of 
her  joy.” 

2.  To  cleanse  John  from  original  sin,  and  to  fill  him  and  his 
mother  Elizabeth  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  that  so  the  honour  and 
devotion  of  all  to  Christ  might  be  increased. 

3.  To  congratulate  her  kinswoman  on  the  miraculous  conception 
of  John. 

4.  To  give  to  all  future  ages  a remarkable  example  of  humility 
and  charity  which  she  showed  in  visiting  Elizabeth,  though  she  was 
now  made  Mother  of  God  and  Mistress  of  the  world. 

Wherefore,  under  the  title  of  the  Visitation  of  the  Blessed  Virgin, 
many  congregations  have  been  instituted  for  visiting  the  poor 
and  the  sick,  and  those  in  prison,  and  recently  under  this  title 

S.  Francis  of  Sales,  Bishop  of  Geneva,  has  instituted  a congrega- 
tion of  religious  women,  who  are  well  known  throughout  France, 
for  ministering  to  the  sick. 

To  the  hill  country . That  is  Hebron,  according  to  Baronius  and 
others ; or  the  hill  country  of  Judaea. 

Tropologically,  the  soul  filled  with  God,  as  the  soul  of  the 
Blessed  Virgin  was,  ascends  the  mountain  heights,  i.e.  toils  up  the 
steep  paths  of  virtue.  “ The  Word  having  been  conceived  in  the 
mind,”  Bede  says,  “ we  must  ascend  to  the  heights  of  virtue  along 
the  way  of  love;  and  the  city  of  Judah,  i.e.  of  confession  and 
praise,  must  be  reached  by  us ; and  in  the  perfection  of  faith,  hope, 
and  love,  we  must  abide  there  for  three  months.” 

With  haste.  S.  Ambrose  mentions  as  the  first  cause  of  her  haste 
that  she  might  not  tarry  long  out  of  the  house  in  the  public  ways 
“ Learn,  ye  virgins,  not  to  loiter  in  the  streets,  nor  mingle  in  any 
public  talk.”  He  also  adds  a second  reason,  because  she  was  full 
of  joy  and  the  Holy  Spirit ; “ the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit  knows 
nothing  of  slow  endeavours.”

THE  VISITATION  OF  THE  BLESSED  VIRGIN. 


37 


Origen  gives  a third  reason,  because  Christ  in  the  womb  of  the 
Virgin  was  hastening  to  cleanse  John  from  original  sin,  and  to 
sanctify  him.  “ For  Mary,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ who  before  dwelt 
alone  in  the  secret  of  her  chamber,  neither  virgin  modesty  caused 
to  shrink  from  the  public  gaze,  nor  the  rugged  mountains  from 
fulfilling  her  purpose,  nor  the  length  of  the  journey  from  performing 
her  duty.” 

To  a city  of  Judah*  Jerusalem,  according  to  Albertus  Magnus 
and  S.  Bonaventura;  but  Jerusalem  is  generally  mentioned  by 
name,  Jerusalem  also  is  in  the  tribe  of  Benjamin,  not  of  Judah. 
It  is  better,  therefore,  with  Toletus  and  Baronius,  to  suppose  that 
Hebron  is  meant ; for  it  was  situated  in  the  hill  country  of  Judah. 

It  is  very  probable  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  first  went  to  Jeru- 
salem, since  the  feast  of  the  Passover  was  near,  and  then  in  the 
Temple  returned  thanks  to  God,  and  made  an  offering  of  herself 
and  her  child  Jesus  to  Him. 

And  entered  into  the  house  of  Zacharias . This  house  is  thus  de- 
scribed by  Adrichomedus  on  the  authority  of  Nicephorus  in  his 
description  of  the  Holy  Land,  “It  is  one  mile  distant  from 
Emmaus,  near  the  hills.  It  was  still  inhabited  in  the  time  of 
Saligniacus,  and  travellers  were  accustomed  to  salute  it  reverently. 
There  John  was  bom  and  circumcised,  and  concealed  in  a cave  that 
he  might  not  be  slain  with  the  children  of  Bethlehem  by  Herod,  &c. 

And  saluted  Elizabeth^  with  the  usual  Hebrew  salutation,  Peace  be 
to  thee . God  intended  by  means  of  Elizabeth,  being  a matron 
advanced  in  years,  to  make  known  to  the  world  the  conception  of 
the  Virgin,  and  the  secret  Incarnation  of  the  Word  that  had  taken 
place  in  her. 

Elizabeth.  Not  Zacharias;  both  because  he  was  deaf,  and 
because  it  was  not  becoming  that  a man  should  be  saluted  by  the 
Virgin.  Moreover,  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ She  was  the  first  to  give  her 
salutation ; for  the  more  chaste  a virgin  is,  the  more  humble  she 
ought  to  be,  and  the  more  ready  to  give  way  to  her  elders.  Let  her 
then  be  the  mistress  of  humility  in  whom  is  the  profession  of 
chastity.”

S.  LUKE,  C.  1. 


Ver.  41. — And  it  came  to  pass  when  Elizabeth  heard  the  salutation 
of  Mary , &c.  Notice  with  S.  Ambrose,  that  Elizabeth  was  the  first 
to  hear  the  salutation  of  Mary,  but  John  was  the  first  to  perceive  the 
spirit  and  effect  of  her  salutation ; for  to  him,  as  the  future  fore- 
runner of  Christ,  this  salutation  of  the  Virgin,  yea,  even  of  Christ, 
was  chiefly  directed.  Theophylact  says,  " The  voice  of  the  Virgin 
was  the  voice  of  God  incarnate  in  her.” 

It  is  a question  here  whether  the  leaping  of  John  for  joy  (Vul- 
gate ex ultavit,  Greek  itfx/fnjon)  was  a natural  or  rational  move- 
ment Calvin  thinks  that  it  was  only  a natural  one ; but  all  the 
Fathers  and  Orthodox  Doctors  are  of  a contrary  opinion.  Origen 
says,  “Then  first  Jesus  made  His  forerunner  a prophet,”  and 
Irenaeus  (lib.  3 c.  18)  says,  u He  recognised  the  Lord  in  the  womb, 
and  leaping  for  joy  saluted  Him.”  And  S.  Gregory  (lib.  3 Moral 
c.  5),  “ In  his  mother’s  womb  he  was  filled  with  the  spirit  of  pro- 
phecy.” So  also  S.  Cyril,  S.  Ambrose,  S.  Chrysostom.  All  these 
maintain  that  this  leaping  of  John  was  not  only  supernatural,  but 
showed  an  active  use  of  reason,  and  proceeded  from  true  joyfulness 
of  mind ; and  this  is  clear  from  the  words  of  Elizabeth ; The  babe 
leaped  in  my  womb  for  joy. 

Secondly,  this  is  clear,  likewise,  from  the  circumstance  that  John 
communicated  his  joy  to  his  mother. 

Thirdly,  because  in  like  manner  the  Blessed  Virgin  rejoiced 
when  she  sang  the  Magnificat,  therefore  also  John  rejoiced,  who 
was  the  chief  end  and  object  of  the  visitation  of  the  Blessed 
Virgin  and  of  all  these  wonders. 

John  at  this  time  received  the  gift  of  prophecy,  as  the  Fathers 
already  quoted  show.  He  likewise  received  the  extraordinary  gifts 
which  befitted  the  future  forerunner  of  Christ  For  this  had  been 
predicted  by  the  angel  when  he  said,  11  he  shall  be  filled  with  the 
Holy  Ghost  from  his  mother’s  womb.n  In  John,  therefore,  that 
saying  of  S.  Chrysostom  (Horn.  30)  is  true,  “ his  leaping  was  a sign 
of  perfect  soundness ; ” and  also,  of  sanctity. 

Hence  some  think  that  John  was  free  from  sinful  desire,  and 
never  committed  venial  sin ; but  this  privilege  seems  to  have  been

ELIZABETH'S  SALUTATION.

peculiar  to  the  Blessed  Virgin,  to  whom  John  was  inferior.  He 
had,  therefore,  sinful  desire,  and  did  commit  venial  sin,  falling  into 
it  unawares,  but,  perhaps,  never  deliberately.  For  it  is  a rule  of  S. 
Augustine  and  of  theologians,  that  whoever  has  or  has  had  original 
sin,  has  also  sinful  desire,  and  consequently  commits  venial  sin ; but 
John  had  original  sin,  therefore  he  must  have  committed  venial  sin. 

Learn,  morally,  of  what  advantage  the  salutation  and  prayers  of 
the  Saints  are,  and  especially  of  the  Blessed  Virgin,  who  by  one 
word  of  salutation  filled  both  John  and  Elisabeth  with  the  Holy 
Spirit  “ Not  only  the  words,  but  the  very  aspect  of  the  Saints  is 
full  of  spiritual  grace,’1  says  S.  Chrysostom.  For  the  Saints,  and 
above  all  the  Blessed  Virgin,  are  full  of  the  fiery  spirit  of  love. 
Wherefore  he  who  strives  to  make  other  men  spiritual  should  first 
fill  himself  with  the  Divine  Spirit ; for  thus  when  he  speaks  he  will 
breathe  the  same  forth  upon  others,  for  out  of  the  abundance  of  the 
heart  the  mouth  speaketh.  God  also  uses  such  men  as  suitable 
instruments  united  to  Himself.  For  He  is  a most  pure  and  power- 
ful spirit;  wherefore  He  accomplishes  mighty  spiritual  results  by 
means  of  spiritual  men  full  of  zeal,  as  being  like  Himself. 

And  Elizabeth  was  filled , <kc.  She  who  was  before  just  and  holy 
(verse  6)  is  now  made  much  more  just  and  holy,  and  besides  received 
the  gift  of  prophecy.  Moreover  John,  as  I said,  was  first  filled  with 
the  Spirit,  and  then  filled  his  mother  also  with  the  same ; because 
by  his  own  holiness,  merits,  and  prayers,  he  obtained  for  his  mother 
that  she  should  be  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  of  which  he  was  him- 
self full  So  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ Elizabeth  first  heard  the  word,  but 
John  first  experienced  the  grace.  The  mother  was  not  filled  before 
the  son,  but  when  the  son  had  been  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  he 
filled  the  mother  also.” 

Ver.  42. — And  she  spake  out  with  a loud  voice  and  said \ Blessed  art 
thou  among  women . Thou  art  most  blessed  of  all  women  because 
thou  hast  been  chosen  to  be  the  Mother  of  God  Whom  the  whole 
world  cannot  receive. 

Blessed  is  the  fruit  of  thy  womb.  The  fountain  of  all  the  blessings 
and  graces  bestowed  upon  the  Blessed  Virgin  by  God  was  to  be  the

mother  of  God ; for  God  adorned  His  mother  with  every  grace  in 
order  that  she  might  become  an  habitation  worthy  of  Him,  even  that 
she  might  be  worthy  to  become  the  Mother  of  God,  and  whom  would 
such  a Son  bless  rather  than  His  mother.  Elizabeth  therefore,  by 
the  inspiration  of  the  Spirit  knew  that  Mary  had  already  conceived, 
and  that  the  Son  of  God  was  incarnate  in  her.  And  “ He  is  Blessed, 
not  only  as  thou  art,  among  women,  but,  absolutely,  above  angels, 
men,  and  all  creatures,  as  being  the  Creator  and  Lord  of  all  Again 
the  rest  of  the  sons  of  Eve  are  all  under  a curse,  because  they  con- 
tract original  sin  from  her  and  from  Adam.  Christ  alone  is  Blessed 
because  He  is  not  the  natural  son  of  Adam,  but  was  supematurally 
conceived  in  the  Virgin  by  the  Holy  Ghost” 

She  alludes  to  the  prophecy  and  promise  made  to  David,  Of  the 
fruit  of  thy  body  shall  I set  upon  thy  seat , Psalm  132,  n. 

Ver.  43. — And  whence  is  this  to  me , that  the  Mother  of  my  Lord 
should  come  to  met  These  are  words  of  the  greatest  humility  and 
reverence ; John  imitated  his  mother,  saying  when  Christ  came  to 
be  baptized  of  him,  “ I have  need  to  be  baptized  of  Thee,  and 
comest  thou  to  me?” 

Lord , that  is  God,  Who  is  called  absolutely  the  Lord ’ because  He 
is  King  of  kings  and  Lord  of  lords.  Hence  it  is  clear — 1.  That  the 
humanity  of  Christ  was  already  in  Christ  endowed  with  life  and 
united  to  the  Word  or  Son  of  God.  2.  That  the  Blessed  Virgin  is 
rightly  called  Mroxo*,  i.e.f  Mother  of  God  and  not  only  xftarSroxtc, 
Mother  of  Christ,  as  Nestorius  maintained.  3.  That  in  Christ  there 
are  two  natures,  the  human,  for  this  alone  could  He  take  of  His 
Virgin  Mother ; and  the  Divine,  which  the  Father  alone  communi- 
cated to  Him ; but  one  Person,  not  human,  but  Divine.  For  if  in 
Christ  there  had  been  two  persons,  as  there  are  two  natures,  God 
could  not  properly  be  said  to  have  been  born  of  a Virgin,  to  have 
suffered  and  been  crucified,  but  another  person,  that  is  to  say,  a 
man,  or  the  person  of  a man ; but  now  it  is  properly  so  said,  be- 
cause there  is  one  person  in  Christ ; which  is  the  reason  why  the 
attributes  of  the  one  nature  may  be  ascribed  in  the  concrete  to  the 
other,  so  that  this  man,  Jesus,  may  properly  be  called  God,  eternal

and  Almighty ; and  on  the  other  hand,  God  in  Him  may  properly 
be  called  man,  passible  and  mortal,  yea,  He  may  even  be  said  to 
have  suffered  and  died ; because  it  is  the  same  Person,  which  on 
account  of  the  two  natures  which  It  has,  is  at  the  same  time  God 
and  man,  and  accordingly  assumes  to  Itself  the  actions  and  attributes 
both  of  God  and  man.  For  action  belongs  to  persons ; and  this  sole 
(divine)  Person  in  Christ  is  signified  alike  by  the  word  man,  or 
Jesus,  and  by  the  word  God  or  Son  of  God.  Wherefore  what  is 
truly  said  of  one  is  also  truly  said  of  the  other. 

Ver.  44. — The  babe  leaped . Symbolically,  the  leaping  of  John 
prefigured  his  own  martyrdom ; for  by  his  dancing  he  represented 
the  dancing  of  the  daughter  of  Herodias,  by  which  having  pleased 
Herod,  she  asked  and  obtained  of  him  the  head  of  John. 

Ver.  45. — Blessed \ &c.  Elizabeth,  therefore,  knew  by  the  Holy 
Spirit  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  had  believed  the  angel  when  he 
announced  the  conception  and  nativity  of  Christ.  “ Blessed  art 
thou,  both  in  fact  because  thou  already  bearest  Christ  within  thee, 
and  also  in  hope,  because  thou  shalt  bring  forth  Him  Who  will 
make  thee  and  all  who  believe  in  Him  blessed  in  heaven : Blessed 
therefore  art  thou  before  God  and  men.”  Elizabeth  silently  censures 
the  unbelief  of  her  own  husband. 

Ver.  46. — And  Mary  said , My  soul>  &c.  Fitly  does  Mary  make 
answer  to  the  praises  of  herself  celebrated  by  Elizabeth,  by  referring 
them  to  their  fountain,  i.e.  to  God.  S.  Bernard  (. Serm . in  Apoc.  12) 
says,  “Truly  this  is  a song  of  high  praise,  but  also  of  devout 
humility  which  suffers  her  not  to  retain  anything  for  herself,  but 
gives  all  back  rather  to  Him  Whose  blessings  bestowed  upon 
herself  she  was  celebrating.  Thou,  she  says,  magnifiest  the  Mother 
of  the  Lord,  but  my  soul  doth  magnify  the  Lord.  Thou  declarest 
that  thy  son  leaped  for  joy  at  my  voice,  but  my  spirit  has  rejoiced 
in  God  my  Saviour.  He  rejoices  as  the  friend  of  the  bridegroom 
at  the  voice  of  the  bridegroom.  Thou  sayest  she  is  blessed  which 
believed,  but  the  cause  of  faith  and  blessedness  is  the  regard  of 
the  Celestial  Goodness,  so  that  on  this  account  the  rather  all 
generations  will  call  me  Blessed,  because  God  hath  regarded  the

low  estate  of  his  handmaid.”  S.  Bernard  then  shows  that  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  though  she  was  most  humble,  yet  in  the  faith  of 
the  promise  made  by  the  angel  she  was  lifted  high  in  soul,  so  that 
she  doubted  not  that  she  was  elected  to  so  great  a mystery,  but 
believed  that  she  would  soon  be  the  true  Mother  of  God  and 
man;  for  the  grace  of  God  so  works  in  His  elect,  “that  neither 
does  humility  make  them  feeble  spirited,  nor  does  exaltation  of 
soul  make  them  proud.”  God  magnifies  man  in  one  way,  and 
man  magnifies  God  in  another.  God  magnifies  a man  when  He 
heaps  upon  him  riches  and  honours,  graces  and  gifts,  and  raises 
him  above  others ; but  man  cannot  magnify  God  in  this  way,  for 
he  cannot  add  anything  to  Him  either  great  or  small.  He  is  said 
therefore  to  magnify  God  when  he  proclaims  His  greatness,  i.e. 
His  majesty,  almighty  power,  holiness,  wisdom,  &c.  The  meaning  of 
the  Blessed  Virgin's  words  therefore  is,  Thou,  O Elizabeth,  magnifiest 
me  in  honouring  me  with  the  magnificent  title  of  Mother  of  God, 
but  I magnify  God  Who  has  made  me  great,  in  giving  me  so 
great  a Son,  Who  is  God  Himself,  and  has  thought  fit  to  bring 
to  pass  in  me  the  great  mystery  of  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word, 

The  Incarnation  of  the  Word  was  the  greatest  of  all  the  works 
of  God.  i.  It  was  a work  of  the  highest  power,  to  unite  heaven 
to  earth,  God  to  man ; 2.  of  the  highest  goodness,  by  which  God 
communicated  Himself  wholly  to  man ; 3.  of  the  highest  wisdom, 
by  which  He  effected  this  union  in  a Divine  Person,  so  that  the 
integrity  of  each  nature,  the  human  and  the  divine,  was  preserved 
to  it 

With  this,  therefore,  begins  the  song  of  the  Blessed  Virgin,  which 
of  all  the  songs  of  Holy  Scripture,  of  Moses,  Deborah,  &c.,  is  the 
most  excellent,  as  being  the  most  full  of  the  Divine  Spirit  and  exulta- 
tion. The  Church,  accordingly,  uses  it  daily  in  the  Office  of  Vespers, 
in  order  that  she  may  by  it,  in  the  highest  manner,  celebrate  the 
glories  and  praises  of  God,  and  render  the  highest  thanks  to  Him 
for  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  and  His  other  gifts,  and  that  she 
may  drink  in  the  same  affections  of  devotion,  piety,  love,  and  exul- 
tation that  in  uttering  it  the  Blessed  Virgin  drank  in  from  heaven.

mart's  song  of  praise. 


43 


There  are  three  parts  in  this  song.  In  the  first  (verse  46-50), 
the  Blessed  Virgin  praises  God  for  the  peculiar  blessings  bestowed 
upon  herself  by  God,  especially  for  the  conception  of  the  Word. 
In  the  second  (verse  50-54),  she  praises  Him  for  the  common 
blessings  bestowed  upon  His  whole  people  before  the  coining  of 
Christ  In  the  third  (verse  54  to  the  end),  she  returns  to  this 
greatest  blessing  of  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  which  had  been 
promised  to  the  fathers,  and  made  known  to  herself 

My  souL  Not  only  my  tongue,  nor  my  hand  only,  but  my  soul 
itself  with  all  its  power  magnifies  God.  From  the  inmost  recesses 
of  my  soul,  with  all  the  powers  of  my  mind,  I praise  and  glorify 
God ; I employ  and  entirely  devote  all  the  strength  of  my  soul  in 
His  praise ; so  that  my  understanding  contemplates  Him  alone,  my 
will  loves  and  celebrates  no  being  but  Him,  my  memory  dwells  upon 
nothing  but  Him,  my  mouth  speaks  of  and  celebrates  nothing  but 
Him,  my  hand  performs  only  those  things  which  tend  to  His  service, 
my  feet  move  forwards  only  to  those  things  which  tend  to  His  glory. 

Symbolically,  Toletus  says,  The  Blessed  Virgin  rightly  says  my 
soul — 1.  Because  she  alone  had  her  soul  in  her  own  power,  and  was 
mistress  over  it,  because  she  possessed  it  in  patience,  having 
dominion  over  all  its  affections  and  passions.  But  we  do  not  pos- 
sess our  souls,  because  we  are  ourselves  possessed  by  anger,  pride, 
concupiscence  or  some  other  like  passion.  2.  Because  she  had 
wholly  delivered  up  her  soul  to  her  Son ; and  those  things  which 
belonged  to  her  Son  were  hers  also.  Whence  her  soul  having  been 
delivered  up  to  her  Son  returned  entirely  to  her  own  power,  and 
she  truly  calls  it  my  soul  3.  On  account  of  her  loving  affection  for 
it;  for  the  more  any  one  loves  God,  the  more  he  loves  his  own 
soul  Since,  therefore,  the  Blessed  Virgin  loved  God  chiefly  above 
all  men,  and  had  never  committed  any  sin,  she  loved  her  own  soul 
very  greatly.  And  that  which  we  love,  on  account  of  our  love  for 
it  we  call  our  own.  She  therefore  who  so  loved  her  own  soul,  truly 
called  it  her  own. 

And  my  spirit  hath  rejoiced.  Exultavit.  The  Blessed  Virgin, 
admiring  the  divine  power,  holiness,  justice,  benignity  of  the  Spirit

of  God  incarnate  in  her,  exults  and  leaps  and  sings  for  joy.  Euthy- 
mius  (in  Ps.  9)  says,  44  Exultation  is,  as  it  were,  an  intensified  joy, 
which  causes  the  heart  to  leap  up  vehemently  with  excess  of  joy, 
and  to  be  raised  on  high.”  Cajetan  also  says,  " Exultation  is  an 
overflowing  joy,  which  breaks  forth,  modestly  however  and  seriously, 
in  the  external  signs  of  gesticulation,  singing,  and  jubilation. 

There  is  an  allusion  here  to  Isaiah  lxl  10, 1 will  greatly  rejoice  in 
the  Lord \ and  my  soul  shall  be  joyful  in  my  God ; and  still  more  to 
the  words  of  Anna,  1 Sam.  ii.  1.,  My  heart  rejoiceth  in  the  Lord, 
&c.,  for  as  Anna,  who  was  barren,  rejoiced  in  conceiving  Samuel 
by  the  miraculous  help  of  God,  so  the  Blessed  Virgin  rejoiced  in 
conceiving  Emmanuel  (of  whom  Samuel  was  a type)  by  the  power  of 
the  Holy  Spirit 

S.  Augustine,  writing  on  the  Magnificat,  shows  that  the  Virgin 
here  does  two  things : first,  she  praises  the  goodness  and  mercy  of 
God,  as  in  the  preceding  verse  she  had  praised  His  power  and 
majesty ; secondly,  she  pours  forth  the  expression  of  the  sweetness 
and  delight  which  she  had  received  in  the  conception  of  her  Son ; 
and  in  this  he  says  that  the  Mother  of  God  imitated  the  angels, 
who  in  heaven  perform  these  two  things,  viz.,  meditate  on  the 
incomprehensible  majesty  of  God,  and  enjoy  His  ineffable  good- 
ness and  sweetness ; and  they  so  admire  them  as  to  rejoice  in  and 
love  them.  His  words  are,  41  Thou  hast  seen  His  majesty,  thou 
hast  tasted  His  sweetness ; therefore  that  which  thou  hast  received 
inwardly,  thou  hast  poured  forth  abroad,  and  thou  hast  rejoiced  in 
His  justice.  My  spirit  hath  rejoiced ; the  soul  magnifies ; the  spirit 
rejoices.  In  God  my  Saviour : the  word  God  denotes  His  power; 
the  word  Saviour  (or  salvation)  denotes  His  mercy.  For  these  are 
two  things  which  the  spirits  of  angels  and  saints  in  that  fountain  of 
good  drink  in  by  eternal  contemplation ; viz.,  the  incomprehensible 
Majesty  of  God,  and  His  ineffable  goodness;  the  one  of  which 
produces  a sacred  fear,  and  the  other  love ; they  venerate  God  for 
His  majesty;  they  love  Him  for  His  goodness;  so  that  love  being 
joined  with  reverential  fear  may  not  be  lost,  and  fear  being  joined 
with  love  may  not  have  torment”

MARY’S  SONG  OF  PRAISE.

Lastly,  as  in  the  conception  of  the  Word  the  very  highest  of 
blessings  was  bestowed  upon  the  Virgin,  so  she  experienced  the 
very  highest  exaltation  on  account  of  it,  so  that  her  spirit  seemed 
to  leap  forth  for  joy  from  her  body,  and  to  hasten  forth  towards 
God;  and  perhaps  it  would  have  done  so,  had  not  God  by  His 
power  kept  it  in  her  body.  For  when  she  died  several  years  after, 
she  died  not  of  sickness,  but  of  love,  joy,  and  the  desire  of  seeing  her 
Son,  as  Suarez  and  other  theologians  think.  Moreover  this  exal- 
tation, Albertus  says,  was  not  transient,  but  remained  as  a habit 
through  the  whole  of  her  life.  He  adds,  that  on  account  of  her 
possessing  this  continual  exultation  in  God,  she  was  above  all 
entirely  dead  to  the  world  and  to  this  mortal  life ; so  that  her  life 
was  always  hid  with  Christ  in  God,  and  being  present  in  the  angelic 
court  she  dwelt  in  the  sanctuary  of  God,  and  she  could  say  in  a 
more  excellent  manner  than  Paul  or  any  other  creature,  MI  live, 
yet  not  I,  but  Christ  liveth  in  me.”  Gal  vi. 

My  Spirit . That  is,  my  soul,  as  Euthymius  and  others  say;  as  if 
my  Spirit  hath  rejoiced,  &c.,  were  the  same  as  my  soul  doth  magnify , 
&c.  But  the  opinion  of  Toletus  and  others  is  better,  who  think 
that  the  spirit  is  more  than  the  soul ; wherefore  by  the  soul  they 
understand  the  intellect,  and  by  the  spirit  the  will.  More  simply, 
by  the  soul  you  may  understand  the  lower  part  of  the  soul,  which 
regards  natural  objects;  by  the  spirit  the  superior  part,  which 
beholds  spiritual  and  divine  things.  The  soul,  therefore,  is  natural 
and  contemplates  natural  things ; the  spirit  is  supernatural  and  con- 
templates heavenly  things.  The  spirit,  therefore,  signifies. — i.  the 
mind ; 2.  the  vehement  and  fervent  impulse  of  the  mind  towards 
joy ; 3.  that  this  impulse  is  inspired  by  the  Holy  Spirit  Moreover, 
the  Spirit,  as  being  the  superior,  draws  the  soul  and  body  along  with 
it,  so  that  they  likewise  may  exult  with  joy,  according  to  the  saying 
in  Psalm  84,  “ My  heart  and  my  flesh  rejoice  in  the  living  God.” 

In  God  my  Saviour  Vulgate,  salutari  meo;  Greek,  eonrrj^  /aou.

S.  LUKE,  C.  I. 


She  says  my  Saviour — i.  Because  Jesus  is  my  son.  a.  Because 
He  is  also  my  Saviour,  both  because  He  has  preserved  me  above 
others  from  all  sin,  and  filled  me  with  all  grace,  and  because  He 
has  made  me  the  mediatrix  of  salvation  for  all  men,  so  that  I am 
as  it  were  the  cause  and  the  mother  of  salvation  to  all  who  are 
to  be  saved. 

S.  John  of  Damascus,  when  the  hand  with  which  he  had  written 
the  defence  of  the  worship  of  sacred  images  had  been  cut  off  by 
Leo  the  Isaurian,  and  had  been  miraculously  restored  by  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  sang  the  words,  " My  spirit  hath  rejoiced  in  God 
my  Saviour,  and  in  His  Mother,  for  He  that  is  mighty  hath  done 
to  me  great  things.” 

Ver.  48. — For  He  hath  regarded , &c.  S.  Augustine  (super  Mag- 
nificat) says,  “This  is  the  grace  of  her  exultation,  that  He  hath 
regarded  the  low  estate  of  His  handmaiden : it  is  as  if  she  said, 
because  I exult  in  His  grace,  therefore  my  exultation  is  from  Him ; 
and  because  I love  His  gifts  on  account  of  Himself,  therefore  I 
exult  in  Him.  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  57  in  Cant.)  says,  “God  regards 
the  earth  and  causes  it  to  tremble;  He  regards  Mary  and 
infuses  grace.  He  hath  regarded,  she  says,  the  lowliness  of  His 
handmaiden,  for,  behold,  from  henceforth  all  generations  shall 
call  me  blessed.  These  are  not  the  words  of  one  lamenting  or 
fearing,  but  of  one  rejoicing.  Hence  He  says  to  her,  Arise  quickly, 
my  love,  my  dove,  my  fair  one,  and  come  away.” 

Lowliness , or  low  estate.  Vulgate,  humilitatem ; Greek,  rawtlwin. 
Humility  here  properly  means  lowliness  of  estate,  not  the  virtue 
of  humility  as  opposed  to  pride,  for  this  is  called  rawuHtf^ewii; 
for  humility  alone  among  virtues  is  ignorant  of  itself ; and  he  who 
boasts  of  his  humility  is  proud,  not  humble. 

Secondly,  however,  by  humility  may  be  understood  the  virtue 
itself  of  humility ; for  on  account  of  this  God  had  regard  to  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  and  chose  her  for  His  mother ; for  a humble  person 
recognises  his  virtues  as  being  the  gifts  of  God ; wherefore  among 
them  he  sees  also  his  own  humility,  but  he  ascribes  it  not  to 
his  own  strength,  but  to  the  grace  which  he  had  received  from  God.

THE  HUMILITY  OF  MARY.

As,  therefore,  the  Blessed  Virgin  here  recognises  her  election  to 
be  the  Mother  of  God  (which  was  a far  greater  thing),  so  likewise 
she  recognises  that  she  was  fittingly  adorned  for  so  great  a dignity 
by  her  humility,  virginity,  and  other  virtues  which  had  been  imparted 
to  her  by  God.  For  a humble  person  recognises  his  own  low 
estate,  his  misery,  his  poverty,  yea,  even  his  own  nothingness,  and 
ascribes  all  lhat  he  is  and  has  to  God,  Whose  he  is,  and  says  with 
the  Psalmist,  Not  unto  us,  O Lord,  not  unto  us,  but  unto  Thy  Name 
give  the  glory \ 

Listen  to  S.  Augustine  {Serm.  2 de  Assump.),  “O  true  humility 
which  hath  borne  God  to  men,  hath  given  life  to  mortals,  made 
new  heavens,  and  a pure  earth,  and  given  liberty  to  the  souls  of 
men.  The  humility  of  Mary  was  made  the  heavenly  ladder  by 
which  God  came  down  to  earth.  For  what  does  regarded  mean 
but  approved  ? For  many  seem  in  the  sight  of  men  to  be  humble, 
but  their  humility  is  not  regarded  by  the  Lord.  For  if  they  were 
truly  humble,  then  they  would  not  wish  to  be  praised  by  men, 
and  their  spirit  would  not  rejoice  in  the  world  but  in  God."  And 
S.  Chrysostom  {Horn.  2 in  Ps.  50)  says,  " The  greatest  sacrifice  01 
all  is  humility,  for  the  same  man  who  by  sinning  has  separated 
himself  from  God,  subjects  himself  to  Him  by  humility,  when  he  is 
converted  to  penitence.”  And  lastly  S.  Bernard  says,  “ It  is  humility 
which  truth  begets  for  us,  and  it  has  not  heat,  and  it  is  humility 
which  love  forms  and  inflames.  The  latter  consists  in  affection, 
the  former  in  knowledge:  by  the  former  we  learn  that  we  are 
nothing,  and  we  learn  it  from  ourselves  and  our  own  weakness; 
by  the  latter  we  tread  underfoot  the  glory  of  the  world,  and  we 
learn  it  from  Him  Who  emptied  Himself,  and  Who,  when  men 
sought  to  make  Him  a king,  fled ; but  when  He  was  sought  for 
reproaches  and  for  the  Cross,  He  did  not  flee,  but  offered  Himself 
willingly.”  The  Blessed  Virgin  had  both  these  (humility  and  love) 
in  an  eminent  and  heroic  degree. 

For  behold  from  henceforth,  &c.  S.  Augustine  says  here,  “ Thou, 
0 Elizabeth,  sayest  concerning  me,  Blessed  art  thou  who  believedst  ; 
but  I say,  From  this  time  (when  I conceived  the  Son  of  God)  all

generations  shall  call  me  blessed.  Mary,  who  was  humble  before 
God,  and  lowly  before  men  on  account  of  God,  obtained  witness 
that  she  was  regarded  in  both  respects  : for  both  her  humility 
before  God  was  acceptable,  and  her  low  estate  before  men  was 
changed  into  glory.  Wherefore  it  follows,  from  henceforth  all 
generations  shall  call  me  blessed.” 

Blessed.  Gerson  (super.  Magnificat)  says,  “Thou  art  worthy 
of  our  praises,  O Holy  Virgin,  thrice  and  four  times  blessed. 
Blessed — i.  because  thou  didst  believe.  2.  Because  thou  art 
full  of  grace,  according  to  the  salutation  of  Gabriel.  3.  Because 
Blessed  is  the  fruit  of  thy  womb.  4.  Because  He  that  is 
mighty  hath  done  to  thee  great  things.  5.  Because  thou  art  the 
Mother  of  the  Lord.  6.  Because  thou  art  fruitful  and  yet  retainest 
the  honour  of  virginity.  7.  Because  thou  seemest  to  have  none 
like  thee,  among  those  that  were  before  thee,  or  among  those  that 
come  after.” 

AU  generations.  All  future  ages  and  generations  of  the  faithful 
Cardinal  Hugo  says,  “All  generations,  i.e.  all  nations  of  Jews  and 
Gentiles,  of  men  and  women,  of  rich  and  poor,  of  angels  and  of 
men,  because  all  through  her  have  received  a saving  benefit : men 
have  received  reconciliation ; angels  restoration  (of  their  numbers). 
For  Christ  the  Son  of  God  wrought  salvation  in  the  middle  of  the 
earth,  that  is,  in  the  womb  of  Mary,  which  by  a certain  wonderful 
propriety  is  called  the  middle  of  the  earth.  For,  as  S.  Bernard 
says,  towards  it  look  both  those  who  dwell  in  heaven  and  those 
who  dwell  in  the  lower  regions,  i.e.  in  purgatory,  and  those  who 
dwell  in  the  world.  The  first,  that  they  may  be  filled  up  again,  the 
second  that  they  may  be  delivered,  the  third  that  they  may  be 
reconciled.  And  then,  assigning  the  reason,  he  adds,  from 
henceforth  therefore,  O Blessed  Virgin,  all  generations  shall  call 
thee  blessed,  because  thou  hast  brought  forth  life,  grace,  and  glory 
for  all  generations,  life  for  the  dead,  grace  for  sinners,  glory  for 
the  miserable.  Therefore  it  is  said  of  her,  Judith,  c.  xv.  io, 
44  Thou  art  the  glory  of  Jerusalem,  thou  art  the  joy  of  Israel,  thou  art 
the  great  rejoicing  of  our  people,  because  thou  hast  done  coura-

geously.  The  first  is  the  word  of  the  angels,  whose  loss  was 
repaired  by  her;  the  second  is  the  word  of  men,  whose  sadness 
was  by  her  changed  into  joy;  the  third  is  the  word  of  women, 
whose  dishonour  was  done  away  with  by  her;  the  fourth  is  the 
voice  of  the  dead,  whose  captivity  was  brought  back  by  her.** 

The  truth  of  this  prophecy  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  is  clear  from  the 
event;  for  we  have  seen  her  worshipped  and  honoured  by  all 
nations  and  generations  with  shrines,  churches,  festivals,  con- 
gregations, societies  of  religious,  vows,  supplications,  litanies  in 
such  numbers  as  the  rest  of  the  Saints  joined  together  do  not 
obtain;  yea,  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  alone  is  paid  the  worship  of 
hyperdulia,  as  to  God  is  paid  the  worship  of  latria,  while  to  the 
rest  of  the  Saints  is  paid  the  worship  of  dulia.  Thy  honour,  thy 
praise  and  glory,  O Blessed  Virgin,  will  live  as  long  as  the  angels 
shall  live,  as  long  as  men  shall  live,  as  long  as  Christ  shall  live,  as 
long  as  God  shall  be  God,  for  ever  and  ever. 

Ver.  49. — Far  He  that  is  mighty  hath  done  to  me  great  things . 
For  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  is  a greater  work  than  the  creation 
of  the  whole  world;  wherefore  the  Blessed  Virgin,  as  being  the 
Mother  of  God,  is  greater  than  all  angels,  all  men,  and  all  creatures 
taken  together.  Augustine  (Serm.  2 de  Assump.)  says,  “What 
great  things  hath  He  done  unto  thee,  O Lady,  that  thou  shouldest 
merit  to  be  called  blessed  ? I truly  believe  that  thou,  a creature, 
gavest  birth  to  the  Creator;  a servant,  thou  broughtest  forth  the 
Lord.”  “He  that  is  mighty  hath  done  to  me  wonderful  things," 
says  Titus,  “since  I,  still  a virgin,  have  conceived  by  the  will  of 
God,  passing  over  the  bounds  of  nature;  I have  been  accounted 
worthy,  without  being  joined  to  a husband,  to  be  made  a mother, 
not  of  any  one,  but  of  the  Only  Begotten  Son  of  God." 

Cardinal  Hugo  mentions  twelve  great  things  belonging  to  the 
Virgin : — 1.  Sanctification  in  the  womb  of  her  mother.  2.  The  saluta- 
tion of  the  angel.  3.  The  fulness  of  grace.  4.  The  conception  of  her 
Son.  5.  Fruitful  virginity.  6.  Virgin  fruitfulness.  7.  Her  honoured 
humility.  8.  Her  ready  obedience.  9.  The  devotion  of  her  faith.

dominion  over  heaven.  S.  Thomas  {part . i,  qu.  25,  art  6)  teaches 
that  it  is  possible  for  God  to  do  better  works  than  He  has  done 
with  the  exception  of  three:  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word;  the 
maternity  of  God ; and  the  beatitude  of  man  which  consists  in  the 
vision  of  God ; for  God  can  do  nothing  better  or  greater  than  these, 
because  nothing  can  be  greater  or  better  than  God  Himself.  The 
Blessed  Virgin  is  called  by  Hesychius,  Bishop  of  Jerusalem  (ham. 
2 de  S.  Maria ),  n The  entire  complement  of  the  Trinity,  because 
both  the  Holy  Ghost  came  to  her,  and  sojourned  with  her,  and  the 
Father  overshadowed  her,  and  the  Son,  borne  in  her  womb,  dwelt 
within  her.” 

He  that  is  mighty . Vulgate,  potens ; Greek,  6 dvrarfa.  This  is  one 
of  the  ten  names  of  God,  for  the  Septuagint  used  to  render  the  Hebrew 
word  122  (gibbor),  i.e.  mighty,  strong,  whence  is  derived  Gabriel , ie. 
the  strength  of  God.  The  Blessed  Virgin,  says  Titus,  adds  this — first, 
that  no  one  may  disbelieve  this  mystery.  Let  no  one  wonder  if  I a 
virgin  have  conceived,  for  He  Who  hath  wrought  this  work  is  the 
Mighty  God.  Secondly,  that  she  may  show  that  what  the  angel  had 
promised  (verse  35)  is  fulfilled  in  her,  the  power  (Greek,  dufa/us)  of 
the  Highest  shall  overshadow  thee.  She  alludes  to  Isa.  vil  14  and 
ix.  6,  His  name  shall  be  called  Wonderful \ Counsellor , the  Mighty  God 
122  (Elgibbor),  i.e.  mighty,  strong  as  a giant ; whence  Gabriel 
announced  His  birth,  whose  name  signifies  the  power  and  strength 
of  God. 

And  holy  is  His  name.  The  Blessed  Virgin  shows  that  the 
promise  of  the  angel,  The  Holy  Ghost  shall  come  upon  thee,  was  ful- 
filled ; and  therefore  she  says,  And  holy  is  His  Name. 

Toletus  and  Francis  Lucas  are  of  opinion  that  the  Virgin  here 
celebrates  two  great  things  as  done  to  her  by  God — 1.  The  Incarna- 
tion of  the  Word,  by  which  she  was  made  the  Mother  of  God,  and 
therefore  the  mistress  and  queen  of  all  angels  and  men ; and,  2. 
Her  own  preparation  and  sanctification  for  the  accomplishment  of 
the  Incarnation  in  her.  For  as  it  was  a work  of  power  for  God  to 
be  made  man  of  a virgin,  so  it  was  a work  of  holiness  to  prepare 
the  Virgin  so  as  to  be  fit  for  conceiving  in  her  womb  the  Holy  and

THE  INCARNATION  OF  THE  WORD. 


51 


Immaculate  Word  of  God,  For  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  so  sancti- 
fied by  the  Holy  Ghost  that  she  contracted  no  sin  at  all,  and 
far  exceeded  all  the  angels,  even  the  seraphim,  in  grace  and 
holiness. 

But  more  plainly  and  fully,  we  may  refer  both  clauses  of  this  verse 
to  both  works,  namely,  to  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word  as  well  as  to 
her  own  preparation  and  sanctification  for  It  For  each  of  these 
was  a work  of  the  excellent  power  as  well  as  holiness  of  G6d, 
because  each  was  accomplished  by  the  coming  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
upon  her  to  sanctify  both  Christ  and  the  Virgin ; according  to  the 
announcement  of  the  angel,  Thai  Holy  Thing  which  shall  be  bom  of 
thee  shall  be  called  the  Son  of  God . For  Christ  was  the  Holy  of 
Holies,  the  Fount  of  holiness,  sanctifying  the  whole  world. 

The  meaning  therefore  is,  God  Himself,  as  signified  by  His  own 
name,  is  holy,  possesses  all  purity,  holiness,  power,  perfection,  and 
therefore  is  to  be  worshipped,  adored,  and  celebrated  in  every  way. 
God  therefore  is  holy  in  all  His  works,  and  above  all  in  this  most 
holy  mystery  of  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word ; by  which  He  sancti- 
fied Christ,  the  Blessed  Virgin,  and  all  the  faithful. 

Lastly,  God  incarnate  is  called  holy  because  He  assumed  flesh 
and  blood  for  the  purpose  of  offering  it  to  God,  both  in  life,  and  on 
the  cross,  and  in  His  death  for  the  salvation  of  men.  For  as  S. 
Isidorus  says  (lib.  15,  Origin,  c.  14),  w Nothing  was  called  holy  among 
the  ancients  unless  it  was  consecrated  or  sprinkled  with  the  blood 
of  a victim.  Also  that  is  holy  (sanctum)  which  is  ratified  (sancitum) 
with  blood;  moreover  to  ratify  (sancire)  is  to  confirm.”  See  Heb. 
ix.  12,  &c.  S.  Augustine  (lib  2 de  Serm.  Dom.  31)  says,  “That  is 
holy  which  it  is  impious  to  violate  and  defile ; and  assuredly  any 
one  is  held  guilty  of  this  crime  who  only  attempts  or  wills  it  with 
regard  to  a holy  thing,  which  nevertheless  remains  by  its  nature  in- 
violable and  incorruptible.”  But  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  5 in  Vigil. 
Haftv.)  makes  sanctity  or  holiness  consist  in  clemency  and  gentle- 
ness, according  to  that  saying  concerning  Moses,  Ecclesiasticus  xlv.  4, 
He  that  sanctified  him  in  his  faithfulness  and  meekness ; and  he 
continues,  “ In  order  that  sanctification  may  be  perfect  we  have  need

to  learn  gentleness  and  courtesy  in  social  life  from  the  Saint  of 
Saints  ; as  He  says  Himself,  Learn  of  Me,  for  1 am  meek  and  lowly  in 
heart.” 

Hence  some  more  recent  interpreters  refer  the  words  Holy  is  His 
Name , to  the  following  verse,  and  His  mercy , &c.,  as  if  this  were  the 
holiness  of  God  ; but  literally  they  must  be  referred  to  what  precedes, 
as  I have  said.  Hence  Euthymius  (in  Ps \ n)  says,  “He  properly 
is  called  pious  (o*/o$)  who  observes  piety  and  religion  in  those 
things  which  pertain  to  God ; but  he  is  called  holy  (dyiot)  who  is 
made  a partaker  of  the  Divine  nature  by  following  the  path  of 
virtue.”  Further,  holy  (sanctus)  in  Hebrew  is  ttnp,  that  is,  removed 
and  separated  from  all  vice,  blemish,  and  even  from  intercourse  with 
the  vulgar ; as  God  is  especially,  Whose  holiness  and  majesty  is  so 
far  removed,  so  lofty  and  exalted,  that  it  infinitely  transcends  all 
gods,  angels,  and  men.  Whence  S.  Dionysius  ( de  Divin.  nom.  c.  12) 
says,  “ Since  holiness  is  free  from  all  taint,  and  is  purity  altogether 
perfect  and  immaculate,  hence  God,  from  the  superabundance  of 
the  purity  and  all  the  excellences  with  which  He  is  filled,  is  called 
the  Holy  of  Holies.”  And  Bede  says,  “His  name  is  called  holy 
because  in  the  height  of  His  marvellous  power  He  transcends  every 
creature,  and  is  widely  removed  from  the  works  which  He  has 
made.  This  is  better  understood  in  the  Greek  tongue,  in  which 
the  very  word  that  means  holy  (dyw)  signifies  as  it  were  to  be  apart 
from  earth  : and  by  imitation  of  Him  in  our  small  measure  we  are 
taught  to  separate  ourselves  from  all  who  are  neither  holy  nor 
dedicated  to  God,  by  those  words  of  the  Lord,  Be  ye  holy , for  1 
am  holy ; for  whoever  has  consecrated  himself  to  God  will  rightly 
appear  as  one  free  from  the  world  ; for  he  is  able  even  himself  to  say, 
while  we  walk  upon  the  earth  we  have  our  conversation  in  heaven.” 

Christians  therefore  being  called  by  Christ  to  fulness  of  holiness 
ought  to  be  holy  (whence  they  are  continually  called  by  S.  Paul 
holy  [or  saints]),  yea,  more  holy  than  all  the  faithful  who  lived  in 
the  time  of  Moses,  Abraham,  &c ; for  Christianity  is  nothing  else 
than  the  life  of  Christ  Let  the  Christian  therefore  so  live  as  it 
becomes  the  disciple  of  Christ,  so. that  his  life  may  be  a living

THE  STRENGTH  AND  POWER  OF  GOD.  S3 

image  of  the  holiness  of  Christ,  so  that  whoever  sees  and  hears 
him,  may  seem  to  himself  to  see  and  hear  Christ  in  him. 

Ver.  50. — And  His  mercy , &c.  As  God  is  all-powerful  and 
all-holy,  so  is  He  all-merciful,  and  that  continually  towards  all 
who  in  any  age  love  Him,  and  therefore  fear  to  offend  Him.  This 
is  the  second  part  of  this  song,  in  which  the  Blessed  Virgin  passes 
from  the  peculiar  benefits  bestowed  by  God  upon  herself,  to  those 
bestowed  in  common  upon  all  Israel,  i.e.  upon  all  the  faithful 

Ver.  51. — He  hath  shewed  strength , &c.  The  Virgin  has  been 
praising  the  mercy  of  God  towards  those  who  fear  Him,  and  now 
she  goes  on  to  praise  His  severity  and  justice  towards  those  who 
despise  Him. 

With  His  arm.  The  strength  and  power  of  God  are  anthro- 
pomorphically  expressed  by  the  hand,  the  finger,  the  right  hand, 
but  most  of  all  by  the  arm : for  the  strength  of  man  puts  itself 
forth  in  his  arms.  The  meaning  therefore  is,  God  has  in  every  age 
wrought  many  things  by  His  mighty  arm,  as  in  the  case  of  Pharaoh 
by  Moses,  &c.  But  much  more  has  God  shown  His  power  by 
causing  Christ  to  become  incarnate  in  me,  by  Whom  He  will 
mightily  overthrow  Lucifer,  hell,  death  and  sin.  Whence  Bede 
and  Theophylact  understand  by  His  arm  here,  mystically,  the 
Son  of  God  incarnate  in  the  Virgin.  For  He  is  the  power  of  God, 
i Cor.  i.  24.  There  is  an  allusion  to  Isa.  liii.  1,  To  whom  is  the  arm 
of  the  Lord  revealed  t 

He  hath  scattered  the  proud ; as  He  scattered  and  overthrew 
Pharaoh,  Nebuchadnezzar,  &c. 

In  the  imagination  of  their  heart.  Vulgate,  mente  cordis  sui. 
Some  refer  these  words  to  the  heart  of  God,  so  that  the  meaning 
will  be,  God  by  His  own  heart,  i.e.  His  will  and  decree,  scattered 
the  proud : so  S.  Augustine  explains  it  “ In  the  imagination  (or 
purpose)  of  His  heart,”  he  says,  " that  is,  in  His  deep  counsel  He 
scattered  them.  It  was  deep  counsel  for  God  to  become  man 
for  me,  and  for  the  innocent  to  suffer  in  order  that  the  guilty  might 
be  redeemed.”  The  Carthusian  (Denis)  follows  this  explanation,  " In 
the  purpose,  i.e.  in  the  intention  and  will  of  His  heart,  i.e.  of  His

understanding,  by  which  He  discerns,  judges,  and  orders  all  things. v 
But  from  the  Greek  it  is  clear  that  the  word  sui  is  not  to  be  referred 
to  the  heart  of  God,  but  to  the  heart  of  the  proud ; for  the  Greek 
is  avr£r,  of  them.  Whence  Euthymius  says,  God  scattered  those 
who  were  proud  in  their  heart. 

Others  refer  the  word  sui,  of  them,  to  the  word  dispersit,  scattered, 
so  that  the  meaning  is,  God  hath  scattered  the  proud  by  means 
of  the  purpose  (Greek,  diavolq)  of  their  heart,  because  He  turns 
back  their  proud  machinations  to  their  own  destruction,  so  that 
He  disperses  them,  according  to  that  saying  Job  v.  13,  He  taketh 
the  wise  in  their  own  craftiness ; as  He  did  to  Pharaoh  when  he 
followed  the  Hebrews  through  the  Red  Sea,  by  drowning  him 
with  all  his  followers  in  the  same  sea;  and  to  the  brethren  of 
Joseph  who  sold  him  that  they  might  destroy  him,  but  God  by 
this  very  thing  exalted  Joseph  and  constrained  his  brethren  to  bow 
down  to  him. 

Ver.  52. — He  hath  put  doivn,  &c.  As  He  put  down  the  proud 
Saul  from  his  royal  throne  by  putting  the  humble  David  in  his 
place ; so  He  put  the  humble  Mordecai  in  the  place  of  the  proud 
Haman,  and  Esther  in  the  place  of  Vashti.  God  has  done,  and 
does,  and  will  do  the  same  in  every  age.  Wherefore  these  past  tenses. 
He  hath  scattered,  put  down,  exalted,  are  to  be  taken  in  the  widest 
sense,  as  signifying  any  time,  future,  present,  or  past,  according  to 
the  Hebrew  idiom.  He  hath  put  down  therefore  signifies  He 
does  and  will  put  down.  The  Virgin  alludes  to  the  words  of 
David,  Psalm  cxiii.  7,  He  raiseth  up  the  poor  out  of  the  dust, 
&c. ; and  of  Hannah,  x Sam.  ii.  7,  The  Lord  maketh  poor  and 
maketh  rich,  &c 

Moreover,  as  often  at  other  times,  so  at  the  time  of  the  Nativity 

of  Christ  God  put  down  the  mighty  from  their  seat  almost 

throughout  the  whole  world,  which,  after  Julius  Caesar,  Pompey, 
Lepidus,  Antony,  and  other  kings,  tyrants,  and  princes  had  been 
removed,  He  had  put  in  subjection  to  Augustus  alone  who  was 
a type  of  Christ,  as  Cyrus  had  been,  Isa.  xlv.  1.  Whence,  when 

Christ  was  born,  he  refused  the  title  of  Lord  which  was  offered

to  him.  Then  also  God  put  down  from  their  seat  Hyrcanus  and 
Aristobulus,  who  were  contending  with  each  other  for  the  govern- 
ment over  Judaea.  Herod  also,  the  infanticide,  was  deprived  of 
his  life  and  kingdom ; and  shortly  afterwards  his  whole  royal 
progeny  perished ; as  also  did  that  of  Augustus  Caesar,  that  it 
might  be  declared  that  Christ  was  now  bom,  and  that  every 
kingdom  was  due  to  him  and  was  prepared  for  Him,  as  Daniel 
foretold,  c.  vii.  14. 

Ver.  53. — He  hath  filled  the  hungry  , &c.  So  He  fed  the  Hebrews 
with  manna  from  heaven  for  forty  years  in  the  wilderness.  So  He 
fed  Elias  when  he  was  hungry  by  an  angel,  and  Daniel  in  the  den 
of  lions  by  Habakkuk,  and  Paul,  the  first  hermit,  by  a raven.  So  also 
He  fed  the  Blessed  Virgin,  hungering  and  thirsting  after  righteous- 
ness, with  the  Word  Incarnate,  and  He  feeds  all  the  faithful  with 
the  same  in  the  Holy  Eucharist,  and  will  feed  them  still  more  in 
heaven.  By  the  hungry  the  poor  are  intended,  since  the  Virgin 
opposes  the  rich  to  them. 

Ver.  54. — He  hath  holpen  His  servant  Israel.  God  hath  taken 
by  the  hand,  raised  up,  helped  and  restored  His  people  Israel, 
whom  He  loved  and  kept  as  a son  or  servant.  He  did  this 
formerly  by  Moses,  Joshua,  David,  &c. ; and  now  much  more  has 
He  done  it,  by  sending  to  Israel  the  Messiah  that  had  been 
promised.  For  at  that  time,  the  commonwealth  and  Church  of 
Israel  had  fallen  into  ruins,  since  the  sceptre  had  been  taken  away 
from  them,  and  transferred  to  Herod  and  the  Romans ; and  the 
priests,  intent  on  their  own  gain,  were  negligent  of  the  welfare  of 
the  people;  wherefore  the  people  were  grievously  afflicted  with 
various  miseries  of  mind  and  body.  God  therefore  at  a season- 
able time  sent  Christ  that  He  might  deliver  out  of  them  all  His  own 
Israel,  that  is,  all  the  faithful  who  were  converted  to  Him,  both 
from  among  the  Jews  and  Gentiles;  whence  S.  Augustine  says, 
u He  helped  Israel ; not  the  Israel  which  He  found ; but  He 
helped  Israel  that  He  might  make  him ; as  a physician  helps  a sick 
man,  that  He  might  heal  the  weak,  and  redeem  the  captive,  that 
He  might  justify  the  impious,  and  save  the  just.”  For  Israel  in

Hebrew  is  the  same  as  the  man  who  sees  God,  or  rather,  one  who  has 
power  with  God,  Gen.  xxxii.  28.  This  is  the  third  part  of  this  song 
in  which  the  Blessed  Virgin  passes  from  the  common  blessings 
in  old  times  bestowed  by  God  upon  Israel,  to  the  peculiar  one  of 
the  Messiah  already  incarnate  in  herself,  which  was  the  greatest 
and  most  excellent  of  alL 

In  remembrance,  &c.  The  cause  why  God  sent  Christ  was  His 
compassion  on  Israel  and  the  whole  human  race,  doomed  to  death 
and  hell  on  account  of  their  sins.  Whence  S.  Leo  says,  “ The  cause 
of  our  restoration  is  none  else  than  the  compassion  of  God.”  God 
is  said  to  have  remembered,  because  He  seemed  to  have  left  men 
in  their  miseries  for  four  thousand  years  and  to  have  forgotten  His 
promise  made  to  the  Fathers ; now  as  it  were  having  remembered 
it,  He  fulfilled  it  in  Christ ; for  this  compassion  is  none  other  than 
the  salvation  brought  by  Christ. 

Ver.  55. — As  he  spake  to  our  fathers,  &c.  The  Virgin  declares 
that  this  mercy,  viz.  the  salvation  brought  by  Christ,  had  been 
promised  by  God  from  ancient  times  to  the  fathers,  Adam, 
Abraham,  &c. ; so  that  the  Incarnation  of  Christ  was  not  a for- 
tuitous event,  but  from  eternity  had  been  provided  and  decreed  by 
God  for  the  salvation  of  Israel  and  of  the  whole  world,  and  had 
been  promised  in  time  to  all  the  Patriarchs  from  the  beginning  of 
the  world;  who  themselves  eagerly  desired  the  same,  and  though 
they  besought  God  for  it  with  ardent  longings,  yet  they  did  not 
obtain  it,  because  God  had  decreed  to  reserve  this  great  gift  for 
this  time  and  age. 

To  Abraham  and  his  seed ’ These  words  are  to  be  referred  to  the 
words  in  remembrance  of  His  mercy , not  to  the  words  as  He  spake  to 
our  fathers , which  are  to  be  enclosed  in  a parenthesis.  God  by 
making  Christ  to  be  incarnate  remembered  His  mercy  formerly 
promised  by  Him  to  Abraham  and  his  seed,  that  is,  to  the  Israelites 
his  descendants.  For  Christ  was  especially  promised  to  them,  but 
inasmuch  as  they  rejected  Him,  God  turned  His  mercy  aside  from 
them  to  the  Gentiles  who  gladly  received  Him.  He  remembered 
Abraham  both  because  he  was  the  first  Patriarch  of  Israel,  and  also

because  he  excelled  in  faith  and  was  therefore  called  by  God  the 
father  of  the  faithful,  and  received  the  promise  concerning  Christ 
Who  should  be  bom  of  his  seed. 

Wherefore  this  seed,  i.e.  the  children  and  posterity  of  Abraham, 
js  not  to  be  understood  carnally  of  the  Jews  descended  from  him 
according  to  the  flesh,  but  spiritually  of  the  faithful  believers  in 
Christ  both  Jews  and  Gentiles,  for  these  follow  the  example  of  the 
faith  of  Abraham  the  father  of  the  faithful. 

For  ever.  This  word  may  be  referred  either  to  the  word  seed,  so 
that  the  meaning  is,  the  seed  of  Abraham  will  last  for  ever,  or  to  the 
word  mercy.  God  hath  remembered  His  mercy,  that  is  the  salvation 
to  be  given  through  Christ ; and  it  was  His  will  that  it  should  endure 
not  for  a hundred  or  a thousand  years  only,  but  for  all  eternity. 
Either  sense  comes  to  the  same. 

Ver.  56. — And  Mary  abode  with  her  about  three  months , &c.  She 
ministered  to  Elizabeth  her  kinswoman,  refreshing  her  with  her  holy 
ministrations  and  conversation,  and  sanctifying  her,  and  John  like- 
wise. So  S.  Ambrose  says,  u It  was  not  only  for  the  sake  of  friend- 
ship that  she  abode  so  long,  but  for  the  advancement  also  of  so 
great  a prophet ; for  if  at  her  first  coming  the  child  had  advanced  so 
far  that  at  the  salutation  of  Mary  he  leaped  in  the  womb,  and  his 
mother  was  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  how  much  may  we  suppose 
that  the  presence  of  the  holy  Mary  added  during  so  long  a time  ? ” 
So  also  Origen  (Hon 1.  9)  shows  that  during  these  three  months,  owing 
to  the  presence  of  the  Virgin  both  John  and  Elizabeth  made  wonder- 
ful progress  in  holiness. 

There  is  a question  here  whether  the  Blessed  Virgin  remained 
until  the  nativity  of  John.  Theophylact,  Euthymius,  Jansenius 
maintain  that  she  did  not 

They  prove  this — 1.  because  the  Blessed  Virgin  came  in  the  sixth 
month,  and  remained,  as  it  were,  three  months  (Vulg.  quasi  tres 
menses),  therefore  she  departed  before  the  ninth  month  was  com- 
pleted, and  therefore  before  Elizabeth  gave  birth  to  the  child ; a. 
because  after  the  departure  of  the  Virgin,  S.  Luke  relates  the  birth  of 
the  child,  without  making  any  mention  of  the  Virgin  ; 3.  and  chiefly,

because  it  was  not  fitting  that  the  Virgin  should  be  present  at  the 
birth ; 4.  because  it  was  proper  that  she  should  avoid  the  crowd 
which  would  gather  together  at  the  birth. 

The  contrary  opinion  is  equally,  and  even  more,  probable ; and  is 
maintained  by  Origen,  S.  Ambrose,  &c. — x.  because  it  would  have 
been  discourteous  to  remain  up  to  the  birth  and  leave  immediately 
before  it ; 2.  because  at  the  time  of  the  birth  Elizabeth  most  needed 
the  presence,  help,  and  consolation  of  the  Virgin ; 3.  because  the 
Virgin  remained  three  months  for  this  very  purpose,  that  she  might 
behold,  embrace,  and  bless  John,  the  wonder  of  the  world,  and  the 
forerunner  of  Christ,  and  on  the  other  hand  that  John  when  bom 
might  behold  and  venerate  the  mother  of  the  Lord,  and  Christ 
the  Lord  in  her.  Whence  Bede  says,  “Mary  remained  until, 
Elizabeth’s  full  time  having  come,  she  saw  the  nativity  of  the 
forerunner  of  her  Lord,  on  account  of  whom  chiefly  she  had 
come.” 

And  she  returned  to  her  own  house . To  Nazareth.  This  house 
of  the  Virgin  was  translated  by  angels  to  Loretto,  as  I have  said 
before. 

Ver.  57. — And  Elizabeths  full  time  came , &c.  S.  Luke  adds  the 
account  of  Elizabeth’s  bringing  forth  to  that  of  the  visitation  of  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  as  an  effect  to  a cause.  For  the  Blessed  Virgin  by 
her  prayers  and  merits  obtained  for  John  both  his  nativity  and  his 
sanctification  ; for  for  this  purpose  she  had  come  from  Nazareth  and 
had  remained  with  her  for  three  months. 

And  she  brought  forth  a son.  John  the  Baptist  on  June  24th ; for 
then  the  Church  keeps  the  yearly  celebration  of  his  birth,  observing 
it  in  his  case  alone,  as  it  does  also  in  the  case  of  Christ  For  as 
regards  the  rest  of  the  Saints  the  Church  celebrates  not  the  day  of 
their  birth,  but  that  of  their  death  on  which  they  passed  horn  a life 
of  misery  to  one  of  blessedness. 

Ver.  58. — And  her  neighbours , &c.  So  was  fulfilled  the  promise 
of  the  Angel  (v.  14),  Many  shall  rejoice  at  his  birth.  Truly  as  S. 
Ambrose  says,  “ The  bringing  forth  of  the  Saints  causes  the  rejoicing 
pf  many,  for  it  is  a common  blessing ; for  justice  is  a public  virtue,”

For  the  just  by  their  example  benefit  all;  many  also,  as  John  did, 
benefit  them  by  their  preaching. 

Ver.  59. — They  came.  That  is,  the  priests  and  relations  whose 
office  it  was  to  perform  the  rite  of  circumcision. 

To  circumcise.  Notice  here  that  the  Jews  were  not  always  cir- 
cumcised in  the  synagogue.  For  that  John  was  circumcised  at  home 
is  inferred  from  the  following  verse,  in  which  it  is  clearly  implied 
that  his  mother  was  present,  who  could  not  at  that  time  according 
to  the  law  (Lev.  xii.  4)  leave  the  house. 

Also  by  circumcision  an  infant  was  purged  from  original  sin,  and 
united  to  the  church,  or  company  of  the  faithful,  whence  at  that  time 
the  name  of  some  faithful  person,  especially  of  the  father,  grand- 
father, or  some  relation  was  given  to  the  infant,  as  is  now  done  in 
baptism. 

Ver.  60. — And  his  mother , &c.  Elizabeth,  who  on  the  salutation 
of  the  Virgin,  being  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  had  learned  the 
mystery  of  the  Incarnation  of  the  Word,  learned  also  the  name  of 
her  son  not  from  Zacharias  but  from  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  all  the 
other  things  that  had  happened  to  Zacharias  in  the  temple  when  he 
was  burning  incense.  For  as  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ She  could  not  be 
ignorant  of  the  Forerunner  of  the  Lord  who  had  prophesied  of 
Christ” 

Ver.  61. — And  they  said \ There  is  none  of  thy  kindred , &c.  This 
is  an  earthly  custom  ; but  John  was  a citizen  of  heaven,  not  of  the 
earth;  whence  he  received  from  heaven  a celestial  name.  “Observe,” 
as  S.  Ambrose  and  Bede  say,  “ that  the  name  belongs  not  to  the 
family  but  to  the  prophet.” 

Ver.  62. — They  made  signs , &c.  Lest  perchance  the  mother  had 
made  a mistake  in  assigning  the  name,  they  refer  to  the  father,  to 
whom  both  the  infant  and  the  giving  of  a name  to  the  infant  belonged. 
They  made  signs  ; “because,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “his  unbelief  had 
deprived  him  of  speech  and  hearing,  they  question  him  by  signs.” 

Ver.  63. — His  name  is  John.  S.  Ambrose  remarks  that  it  is  said 
his  name  is,  not  will  be;  so  that  the  meaning  is,  we  do  not  give  a 
name  to  him  who  has  received  one  from  God,  “ he  has  his  own  name^

Isaac  received  his  name  from  the  laughter  of  his  mother;  Cain 
because  he  was  the  possession  of  his  mother  Eve ; Moses  because 
he  was  drawn  out  of  the  water,  &c. ; so  also  John  received  his  name 
from  the  grace  and  mercy  which  he  received,  not  in  his  conception, 
but  when  he  was  visited  by  the  Blessed  Virgin. 

And  they  all  wondered,  both  at  the  agreement  between  the  father 
and  mother,  and  at  the  name,  which  was  an  unknown  one  in  the 
family;  for  they  did  not  know  that  it  had  been  revealed  from 
heaven  to  Zacharias. 

Ver.  64. — And  his  mouthy  &c.  That  is,  he  began  to  speak.  S. 
Ambrose  says,  “ Rightly  from  that  moment  was  his  tongue  loosed,  for 
that  which  unbelief  had  bound  faith  set  free.99  When  he  saw  John 
really  bom,  he  believed  the  promise  made  to  him  by  the  angel 
concerning  him.  John  therefore,  as  he  had  filled  his  mother  when 
in  her  womb  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  so  now  when  bom  breathed 
the  same  spirit  upon  his  father.  Whence  S.  Gregory  Nazianzen 
says,  “The  birth  of  John  broke  the  silence  of  Zacharias;  for  it 
were  unreasonable,  when  the  voice  of  the  Word  had  come  forth, 
that  the  father  should  remain  speechless.” 

Moreover,  Theophylact  says,  “All  these  things  were  done 
(economically,  that  John  might  be  esteemed  a witness  of  Christ 
worthy  of  credit;"  and  Bede,  “The  future  prophet  is  commended 
by  previous  auspices.99 

Symbolically,  S.  Ambrose  says,  “Because  John  was  a voice 
(according  to  the  words,  1 am  the  voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilder - 
ness),  therefore  at  his  birth  his  father,  who  had  been  dumb,  recovered 
his  voice." 

Ver.  65. — And  fear  came  on  all  that  dwelt,  &c.  That  is,  a 
religious  fear  and  reverence  towards  God  Who  had  done  so  many 
wonderful  works  concerning  John  both  as  to  his  father  and  mother. 
For  where  God  displays  his  power  there  arises  on  the  part  of 
men  towards  Him  and  His  majesty  a sacred  feeling  of  fear  and 
reverence.

THE  HAND  OF  THE  LORD  WITH  JOHN.  6l 

Ver.  66. — What  manner  of  child  shall  this  he,  Sec.  God  did  this 
in  order  that  by  means  of  these  signs  He  might  stir  up  the  minds 
of  all  men  to  the  veneration  of  John  as  the  future  forerunner  and 
disdoser  of  Christ,  and  in  order  that  He  might  procure  authority 
for  him ; and  that  so  his  testimony  concerning  Christ  might 
outweigh  every  objection.  Christ  revealed  to  S.  Bridget  (Lib. 
Revel,  cap.  io 8)  that  there  were  three  saints  who  had  pleased  Him 
above  all  others,  viz.,  the  Blessed  Virgin,  Mary  Magdalen,  and 
John  the  Baptist,  and  that  the  demons,  being  struck  with  terror 
at  his  birth,  bewailed  and  lamented  when  the  angels  and  pious 
Israelites  rejoiced. 

And  the  hand  of  the  Lord  was  with  him.  The  hand,  that  is  the 
wonderful  power,  providence,  care,  grace,  and  favour  of  God  (for 
of  all  these  the  hand  is  the  symbol)  displayed  themselves  in  this 
boy,  so  that  it  might  be  seen  that  he  was  singularly  formed, 
chosen,  and  destined  for  great  things.  And  God  showed  this — i.  by 
announcing  his  nativity  by  an  angel  to  his  father  Zacharias ; 2.  by 
unloosing  the  tongue  and  the  ears  of  Zacharias  at  his  birth,  so 
that  he  might  speak  the  praises  of  God;  3.  by  illuminating  and 
impelling  him  to  prophesy  concerning  the  boy ; 4.  by  giving  to 
Elizabeth  when  old  and  barren  this  offspring  by  a miracle ; 5.  by 
giving  to  the  boy  a new  and  unusual  name.  All  which  things, 
being  for  the  most  part  miracles,  portended  that  John  would  be 
a great  man  and  a prophet,  and  that  God  would  accomplish  great 
things  by  him ; and  all  who  saw  or  heard  these  things  were  filled 
with  great  fear,  joy,  and  hope. 

S.  Ambrose,  Origen,  and  Euthymius  add  that  John  himself  felt 
that  the  hand  of  God  was  upon  him ; since  he  felt  every  day  that 
by  the  operation  of  God  he  grew  and  advanced  in  the  use  of 
reason,  in  holy  inspirations  and  desires,  in  the  love  and  worship 
of  Christ,  in  grace  and  in  merits  beyond  what  was  natural  to  his 
years. 

Ver.  67. — And  his  father  Zacharias  was  filled , Sec.  Zacharias 
already  had  the  Holy  Spirit,  for  he  was  a just  man  (as  we  read  in 
verse  6) ; yet  he  by  the  birth  of  John  received  so  great  a fulness

of  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  both  sanctifying  and  rendering 
him  acceptable,  and  also  gratuitously  given,  i.e.  of  the  spirit  of 
prophecy,  and  he  was  filled  with  so  great  a love  for  Christ,  already 
incarnate  in  the  womb  of  the  Virgin,  that  he  broke  forth  into  this 
prophetic  song  which  the  Church  sings  daily  in  the  Divine  Office 
at  Lauds. 

Ver.  68. — Blessed  be  the  Lord  God  of  Israel  Zacharias  in  this 
song  does  two  things,  i.  He  praises  God  for  the  Messiah  incarnate 
in  the  Virgin,  a.  From  verse  76  to  the  end  he  praises  God  by 
addressing  his  son  John,  and  celebrates  his  office  as  the  forerunner 
of  Christ. 

The  God  of  Israel  For  although  He  is  the  God  of  all  men,  yet 
He  is  especially  the  God  of  Israel,  i.e.  of  His  faithful  people, 
whether  they  were  Jews  and  Israelites  as  formerly,  or  Christians 
as  in  these  days. 

Hath  redeemed , &c.  God  by  means  of  Christ  already  incarnate 
had  begun  the  work  of  the  redemption  and  deliverance  of  the  whole 
world  from  the  yoke  of  slavery  to  the  devil,  sin,  death,  and  hell, 
under  which  it  had  been  held  for  four  thousand  years,  but  especially 
the  redemption  of  Israel,  i.e.  of  the  Jewish  people,  to  whom 
especially  the  Messiah  had  been  promised.  Zacharias  by  the  spirit 
of  prophecy  knew  of  the  incarnation  of  the  Messiah  in  the  womb 
of  the  Virgin,  and  therefore  that  the  redemption  of  the  world  was 
already  begun,  inasmuch  as  the  Redeemer  was  conceived  Who 
after  a few  years  was  about  to  complete  the  redemption  of  the 
world  by  His  death  on  the  Cross. 

And  hath  raised  up  an  • horn  of  salvation.  In  Scripture  horn 
signifies  strength,  power,  victory,  glory,  and  consequently  a king- 
dom ; for  all  the  glory  and  strength  of  horned  animals  consists  in 
their  horns,  as  S.  Chrysostom  says.  Hence  S.  Cornelius,  pontiff 
and  martyr,  is  represented  in  painting  with  a horn,  and  received 
his  name  from  it  because  with  the  strength  of  an  horn  he  resisted 
the  Emperor  Decius,  and  triumphed  gloriously  over  him  by  martyr- 
dom. See  what  I have  said  on  Hab.  iil  4,  Dan.  viii.  4,  and  Deut 
xxxiii.  17.

A HORN  OF  SALVATION.  6$ 

The  meaning,  therefore,  is  that  God  has  again  raised  up  the  horn, 
r.i.  the  excellent  power  and  glory  of  the  kingdom  of  Israel  by  Christ 
the  Son  of  David,  which  horn  had  flourished  in  the  times  of  Joshua, 
and  David,  and  Solomon,  but  had  now  fallen ; and  this  horn  was 
not  temporal  but  spiritual,  as  I have  said  on  verse  32.  There  is 
an  allusion  to  Ezek.  xxix.  21,  In  that  day  the  horn  of  the  house  of 
Israel  shall  hud  forth.  It  is  clear,  therefore,  that  the  horn  of 
salvation  is  Jesus  Christ  Himself  the  Saviour,  and  his  power,  victory, 
and  kingdom ; according  to  that  saying  of  Hannah,  1 Sam.  iL  10, 
The  Lord  shall  give  strength  unto  Bis  king  and  exalt  the  horn  of  His 
anointed.  Tropologically,  Bede  says,  “The  horn  stretches  beyond 
the  flesh,  and  so  the  kingdom  of  Christ  reaches  beyond  the  world 
and  the  joys  of  the  flesh;  according  to  which  figure  David  and 
Solomon  were  consecrated  kings  by  the  horn  of  oil.”  And  Origen 
explains  Isa.  v.  1,  a vineyard  hath  been  planted  in  a horn  (Vulgate, 
vinea  facta  est  in  comu\  as  meaning  the  Church  has  been  planted 
in  Christ. 

Ver.  70. — By  the  mouth  of  His  holy  prophets.  All  the  pro- 
phets prophesied  of  Christ,  eg.  Isa.  xix.  20 ; Jerem.  xxx.  10 ; 
Ezek.  xiil  21. 

Ver.  71. — I hat  we  should  he  saved  from  our  enemies.  As  God 
spake  by  the  prophets,  and  promised  salvation,  i.e.  the  deliverance 
and  salvation  of  Israel  and  the  whole  world  from  captivity  to  the 
devil,  sin,  death,  and  hell,  so  now  hath  He  accomplished  the  same, 
by  giving  a horn  of  salvation,  i.e.  a strong  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ 
Observe  that  Zacharias  here  interprets  the  ancient  prophecies  of  the 
kingdom  and  salvation  of  Christ,  not  in  a temporal  but  in  a spiritual 
sense,  as  is  clear  from  verse  73  and  the  following. 

Ver.  72. — To  perform  the  mercy . As  God  promised  Christ  to  our 
fathers,  so  now  has  He  fulfilled  His  promises,  and  has  shown  Christ 
to  their  posterity,  by  Whom  He  will  deliver  also  the  fathers  from 
limbus,  and  bless  them,  and  bring  them  into  heaven  with  Himself. 
Whence  Theophylact  says,  “The  grace  of  Christ  reaches  even  to 
those  who  were  dead ; for  through  him  all  will  rise  again  : He  also 
fulfilled  the  hope  of  the  fathers;19  for  as  Theophlact  says  again,

S.  LUKE,  c.  I. 


“ When  the  fathers  see  their  sons  enjoying  such  blessings,  they 
rejoice  and  are  partakers  of  their  joy,  in  the  same  way  as  if  the 
blessings  had  been  bestowed  upon  themselves.” 

His  Holy  Covenant — This  covenant  was  made  by  God  with 
Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob,  Gen.  xii.  3,  and  xxvL  4,  and  xxviii.  14 ; 
and  it  is  this,  in  thy  seed  shall  all  the  families  of  the  earth  be  blessed . 
Jeremiah  explains  this  blessing,  ch.  xxxi.  31. 

Ver.  73. — The  oath.  This  may  be  referred — 1.  To  the  word 
remember.  So  Euthymus  takes  it  2.  It  may  be  referred  to  the 
word  mercy.  3.  It  may,  more  properly,  be  referred  to  the  word 
covenant ; so  that  the  meaning  is,  God  hath  sent  Christ,  that  He 
might  show  Himself  mindful  of  the  covenant,  by  which  He 
promised  Him  to  the  fathers ; which  covenant  is  that  great  oath 
which  He  sware  to  Abraham. 

Or  4,  you  may  refer  the  word  oath  more  plainly  and  easily  to  the 
word  perform  in  the  preceding  verse;  so  that  three  reasons  may 
be  signified  here  on  account  of  which  God  has  raised  up  this  horn 
of  salvation — 1.  that  He  might  perform  His  mercy;  2.  that  He 
might  remember  his  covenant;  3.  that  He  might  fulfil  His  own 
oath  by  which  He  swore  to  Abraham  that  He  would  multiply  his 
spiritual  seed,  rather  than  his  seed  according  to  the  flesh,  as  the 
stars  of  heaven,  and  that  in  his  seed  He  would  bless  all  nations. 
Gen.  xxii.  16,  and  Heb.  vl  13,  14.  The  Hebrews  often  leave  words 
to  be  understood  from  those  which  precede  or  follow : so  here  the 
word  oath  is  used  for  the  performance  and  fulfilment  of  the  oath . 
for  these  words  were  spoken  by  Zacharias  when  he  was  exulting, 
and,  as  it  were,  absorbed  in  joy;  so  that  he  has  regard  to  and 
pours  forth  not  so  much  words  as  things ; whence  in  his  words  he 
often  falls  into  solecisms  and  other  defects. 

Ver.  74. — That  we  being  delivered,  &c.  He  explains  the  oath  of 
God,  Le.  the  blessing  which  He  promised  to  Abraham,  and  con- 
firmed with  an  oath,  and  shows  that  it  consists  in  the  salvation 
which  Christ  brought,  that  being  set  free  by  His  grace  from  our 
enemies,  viz.,  from  sin,  the  devil,  and  hell,  to  which  we  had  been 
as  it  were  enslaved,  we  may  now  serve  God  in  holiness.  This

HOLINESS  AND  RIGHTEOUSNESS.

service  is  latria  which  is  the  worship  due  to  God  alone ; for  in  the 
Greek  it  is  Xarpu uf. 

Ver.  75. — In  holiness  and  righteousness.  This  is  the  oath,  or 
blessing  of  God  sworn  to  Abraham,  vis.  the  salvation  and  grace  of 
Christ  and  of  His  Gospel,  the  excellence  and  perfection  of  which 
He  beautifully  describes  in  these  words.  For  the  first  part  of  which 
it  consists  is  liberty,  that  is  deliverance  from  the  slavery  of  sin  and 
the  devil  The  second  is  service,  that  is  the  worship  of  the  true 
and  most  high  God.  The  third  is  love,  not  slavish  fear ; for  the 
Jews  served  God  through  fear  of  punishment,  but  Christians  serve 
Him  like  sons  with  a free  love,  Rom.  viii  15.  The  fourth  part  is 
inward  and  true  holiness  and  righteousness,  not  outward  and 
placed  in  washings,  sacrifices,  and  other  ceremonies  like  the 
righteousness  which  the  Jews  had.  The  fifth  part  is  expressed  in 
the  words  before  God,  so  that  we,  considering  that  we  are  always 
before  the  eyes  of  God,  Who  beholds  the  hearts  of  every  one,  may 
strive  to  show  forth  before  Him  a pure  and  holy  heart,  and  to  per- 
form all  our  works  out  of  such,  knowing  that  God  looks  into  us  and 
beholds  the  very  bottom  of  our  heart,  and  according  to  it  will 
judge  our  works.  The  sixth  part  is,  that  we  should  perform  these 
things,  not  on  one  day,  month,  or  year,  but  all  our  days  by  per- 
severing in  them  even  unto  death. 

Holiness  has  respect  to  God,  and  consists  in  the  holy  worship  of 
God.  Righteousness  has  respect  to  our  neighbour,  and  consequently 
to  oneself.  Holiness,  therefore,  gives  to  God  what  is  His  due, 
Righteousness  to  men  what  is  their  due,  so  that  each  should  give  to 
each  what  is  owing  to  him  either  from  justice  or  charity,  and  con- 
sequently that  a man  shduld  give  to  himself  temperance,  modesty  and 
humility,  by  which  he  may  conform  himself  aright  to  the  rule  of  the 
law  and  of  virtue,  for  this  is  what  he  ought  to  render  to  himself  By 
holiness  and  righteousness,  therefore,  every  observance  of  virtue  is 
signified  that  is  prescribed  in  the  decalogue ; for  holiness  has  respect 
to  the  precepts  of  the  first  table  which  pertain  to  God,  righteousness 
to  those  of  the  second,  which  concern  our  neighbour  and  our  self. 

These  therefore  are  the  duties  of  the  evangelical  life  to  which  Christ

calls  us.  This,  therefore,  is  the  vocation  of  the  faithful,  namely, 
that  denying  ungodliness  and  worldly  lusts  we  should  live  soberly , 
righteously , and  godly  in  this  present  life , looking  for  that  blessed  hope 
and  the  glorious  appearing  of  the  great  God  and  our  Saviour  Jesus 
Christy  Tit  i L 12,  13,  so  that  we  should  imitate  the  holiness  of  God 
and  of  Christ,  and  Christ  should  seem  to  live,  act,  and  speak  in  us ; 
who  gave  Himself  for  ust  that  He  might  redeem  us from  all  iniquity%  and 
purify  unto  Himself  a peculiar  people , zealous  of  good  works , Tit  ii. 
14,  according  to  that  saying  of  S.  Paul,  I live}yet  not  Iy  but  Christ 
liveth  in  me9  Gal  ii.  20.  Let  each,  therefore,  contemplate  the  life 
and  character  of  Christ,  and  in  them  let  him  behold  as  in  a mirror 
his  own,  and  he  will  see  whether  he  is  a true  Christian  or  only  a 
false  painted  one. 

Ver.  76. — And  thou , child.  And  thou  John,  though  thou  art  only 
now  eight  days  old,  yet  when  thou  art  twenty-nine  years  old,  thou 
wilt  be  a Prophet  announcing  and  pointing  out  the  Christ  This  is 
the  second  part  of  the  song  in  which  Zacharias  passes  from  Christ 
to  his  son,  and  foretells  that  he  will  be  the  Prophet  and  Forerunner 
of  Christ  S.  Ambrose,  Origen,  Theophylact,  and  Titus  say  that  the 
infant,  inasmuch  as  he  had  been  gifted  with  the  use  of  reason  in  the 
womb  of  his  mother,  understood  these  words  in  which  his  father 
addressed  him.  Ambrose  says,  “ He  could  hear  the  voice  of  his 
father  who  before  he  was  born  heard  the  salutation  of  Mary.  He 
surely  knew  that  there  were  certain  organs  of  hearing  in  a prophet, 
which  were  unclosed  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  not  by  the  growth  of  the 
body.”  Bede  adds,  “ Unless  perhaps  Zacharias  is  to  be  supposed  to 
have  wished,  as  soon  as  he  was  able  to  speak,  to  declare  rather  for 
their  instruction  who  were  present,  the  future  gifts  of  his  son,  which 
he  had  learnt  long  before  from  the  angeL” 

For  thou  shall  go  before.  As  for  kings  when  approaching,  the 
roads  are  wont  to  be  prepared,  levelled  and  advanced,  by  removing 
stones,  filth,  and  other  impediments  or  eyesores,  so  thou,  my  son, 
wilt  prepare  a way  for  Christ  the  King,  by  removing  whatever 
might  be  an  offence  to  Him  in  the  minds  of  the  Jews,  by  exhorting 
them,  by  word  and  example,  to  repent  and  to  receive  Jesus  as

the  true  Messiah  sent  by  God,  and  to  believe  and  obey  Him,  and 
so  obtain  from  Him  salvation  and  forgiveness  of  sins  and  the  grace 
of  God. 

Ver.  77. — To  give  knowledge  of  salvation,  &c.  That  the  Jews  may 
know  that  they  ought  to  hope  and  seek  for  salvation  from  Christ 
the  Saviour  in,  It.  for,  the  remission  of  sins,  so  that  they  may  obtain 
it  from  Christ  through  faith  in  Him  and  baptism,  for  in  this  con- 
sists the  salvation  of  Christ;  for  sins  are  not  remitted  except 
through  the  salvation  and  grace  of  Christ  Whence  Bede  says,  M As 
if  desiring  to  explain  the  name  of  Jesus,  he  frequently  makes 
mention  of  salvation ; but  lest  you  should  think  it  was  a temporal 
and  carnal  salvation  which  was  promised,  he  says,  for  the  forgiveness 
of  their  sins? 

Ver.  78. — Through  the  tender  mercy , &c.  Vulg.,  Viscera  miseri- 
cordice;  bowels  of  mercy : this  expression  signifies  the  most  inward 
and  greatest  mercy  of  God. 

The  Dayspring.  Observe — 1.  That  this  Dayspring  (Vulg.,  oriens) 
is  in  the  Greek  fraroXi),  Le.  rising,  as  of  the  sun,  or  shooting  up  as  of 
a branch.  The  word  is  used  especially  of  Christ;  whence  the 
Chaldean  version  renders  it  in  Zechariah  iil  8 and  vl  12  by 
Messiah,  le.  Christ 

2.  That  Zechariah  here  alludes  (1.)  to  the  passage  Mai.  iv.  2.  To 
you  that  fear  my  name  the  Sun  of  Righteousness  shall  arise  {orietur) 
with  healing  in  His  wings ; and  to  Wisd.  v.  6,  and  to  Isaiah  lx.  i, 
and  Num.  xxiv.  17,  There  shall  arise  a star  out  of  Jacob  and  a 
sceptre  (Vulg.,  virga,  a rod)  shall  spring  forth  out  of  Israel,  viz. 
Christ,  Who  as  a star  or  a sun  will  illuminate  us,  and  will  make  us 
glad  with  all  grace,  and  as  a leader  and  sun  will  go  before  us  on  the 
way  to  heaven.  (2.)  Zacharias  refers  to  Zech.  iil  8,  Behold  I will 
send  forth  my  servant  the  Branch  : Vulg.,  orientem,  Greek  a»aroXi|» ; 
and  to  Zech.  vl  12,  Behold  the  man  whose  name  is  the  Branch;  and 
to  Isaiah  iv.  2,  In  that  day  the  Branch  of  the  Lord  shall  be  beautiful 
and  glorious:  where  the  Septuag.  translates,  In  that  day  God  shall 
shine  forth  in  counsel  with  glory  ; and  Jerem.  xxiii.  5,  I will  raise 
unto  David  a righteous  Branch . In  Zech.  iii.  and  vi.,  the  Septuag.

renders  Branch  (ortens)  by  &**ro X$,  and  S.  Luke  has  taken  the  word 
(which  is  not  found  anywhere  else)  from  those  passages. 

Observe,  3.  That  in  Zech.  iii.  and  iv.,  for  aWoXi}  the  Hebrew  is 
nDX,  which  properly  signifies  a shoot,  as  S.  Jerome  teaches : whence 
the  Sept  elsewhere  renders  it  by  ftk<kerw<i ; but  the  word  is  used 
to  signify  many  other  things  by  metaphor.  This  is  clear  from 
Ezek.  xxix.  21,  &c. ; and  also  from  the  Septuag.,  which  renders  the 
word  in  Zech.  iii.  and  vi.  (as  I have  said  before)  by  awtroX^,  which, 
although  it  may  be  used  generally  of  any  springing  up,  even  of 
herbs  (according  to  Suidas),  yet  is  properly  used  of  the  rising  of 
the  sun,  moon,  and  stars. 

I say  therefore  that  Christ  is  called  a Branch,  but  a Branch  from  the 
sun,  i.e.  a heavenly  and  divine  Branch.  This  is  clear  (1.)  because  the 
word  a»aroXi9  properly  has  this  meaning.  (2.)  Because  of  what  follows, 
the  Branch  (or  Day  Spring)  from  on  high , i.e.  from  God  and  heaven : 
and  shine  on  those  who  sit  in  darkness  and  the  shadow  of  death ; all 
which  expressions  clearly  refer,  not  to  the  shooting  forth  of  an  earthly 
branch,  but  of  the  sun  or  a star.  So  Theophilus,  Euthymius,  &c. 

Observe,  that  Christ  is  called  both  a heavenly  and  an  earthly 
Branch:  for  Christ  has  two  generations;  a divine,  by  virtue  of 
which  He  is  the  offspring  of  the  Father;  and  a human,  by  virtue 
of  which  He  is  the  offspring  of  His  mother  and  of  David.  Thus 
He  is  spoken  of  by  Isaiah,  Zechariah,  and  others  as  a Branch, 
(1.)  because  He  will  shoot  forth  as  a new  Branch  from  the  root  of 
Jesse  or  David  which  seemed  to  have  dried  up ; a Branch  I say, 
at  first,  shooting  forth  in  heaven,  and  then  transplanted  on  to  the 
earth.  (2.)  By  the  word  Branch  is  signified  the  littleness  and  lowliness 
of  Christ  at  His  birth,  which  afterwards  increased  to  so  great  a 
size  that  the  whole  world  was  embraced  by  its  shadow,  according 
to  the  parable  of  the  grain  of  mustard  seed.  (3.)  Christ  is  signified 
(by  the  same  expression  Branch  or  Dayspring)  as  a second 
Melchisedec,  without  father  as  man ; i.e.  as  a shoot  springing  up 
from  the  earth  alone,  signifying  that  He  was  born  of  a virgin 
mother : but  as  God,  without  mother,  because  he  was  generated 
from  the  Father,  like  a beam  from  the  sun

"THE  DAYSPRING **  AND  "THE  BRANCH.”  69 

Observe  also,  that  to  Christ  are  rightly  attributed  three  qualities 
which  belong  both  to  the  sun,  and  to  a branch,  because  (1.)  He 
arose  in  heaven  with  splendour  and  glory,  and  then  shooting 
forth  from  heaven  He  sprang  up  on  earth.  For  Christ  is  the  Tree 
of  Life  transplanted  to  earth  from  the  celestial  paradise  by  the 
Incarnation,  and  thence  again  ascending  to  heaven  and  paradise, 
by  the  vision  and  fruition  of  Himself  He  bestows  upon  His  Saints 
an  eternity  of  the  highest  glory.  & Jerome  on  Zech.  vL  is, 
explaining  the  passage  mystically,  says,  “ He  who  is  called  Jesus 
because  He  saved  the  world,  is  also  called  the  Dayspring  {mens) 
because  in  His  day  righteousness  arose:  and  He  is  celebrated 
in  the  words  of  the  Psalm,  Truth  shall  flourish  out  of  the  earth, 
because  being  sprung  from  the  womb  of  a virgin  in  the  consum- 
mation of  the  ages,  He  said  I am  the  Truth?  And  again,  “ He 
who  is  crowned  with  our  virtues  will  arise  and  will  be  called  the 
Dayspring ; to  Whom  the  Father  said,  Thou  art  my  Sou,  this  day 
have  I begotten  Thee;  according  to  that  saying  of  Isaiah  (xi  1), 
Then  shall  come  forth  a rod  out  of  the  stem  of  Jesse,  and  a blossom 
shall  grow  up  from  his  root? 

But  other  Fathers  rightly  interpret  the  word  oriens  as  signifying 
the  sun  rising  from  on  high,  namely  heaven,  by  which  they 
understand  Christ  Who  is  the  Light  of  the  world,  and  therefore 
was  bom  on  the  earth,  that  by  means  of  the  flesh  He  might  be 
as  it  were  a transparent  sun  illuminating  every  man  that  comes  to 
Him.  So  Bede,  &a,  and  S.  Gregory  {Lib.  20  in  Job , cap.  18),  who 
says,  " Because  the  light  rises  from  the  east,  He  is  rightly  called 
the  Dayspring,  by  the  light  of  Whose  righteousness  the  night  of 
our  iniquity  is  illuminated." 

In  both  ways,  therefore,  ought  the  word  oriens  to  be  understood 
here,  as  alluding  both  to  th£  springing  up  of  a shoot  and  to  the 
rising  of  the  sun : for  Christ  is  a heavenly  shoot,  and  He  is 
likewise  a sun  shooting  forth  and  springing  from  a Virgin  on  the 
earth,  as  I have  already  said.

mood,  so  that  the  meaning  will  be,  Arise,  shine,  O my  son, 
like  some  new  sun  of  the  world  (for  Zacharias  is  addressing  John), 
so  that  through  faith  in  Christ  thou  mayest  illuminate  sinners 
who  are  sitting  in  the  darkness  of  errors  and  sins,  and  restore 
them  to  the  light  of  truth,  righteousness,  and  salvation,  and  deliver 
them  from  the  tyranny  of  the  devil. 

2.  It  is  better  to  take  iwfAvou  as  an  infinitive ; so  that  the  mean- 
ing  will  be,  Christ  has  visited  us  like  a sun  from  on  high,  to  bring 
the  light  of  true  doctrine,  grace,  righteousness,  and  joy  both  to  the 
fathers  who  were  dead,  and  to  sinners  who  are  alive,  who  both 
were  sitting  in  darkness  and  the  shadow  of  death.  For  literally  the 
fathers  were  sitting  in  the  dark  limbus  of  Hades,  as  it  were  in  the 
shadow  of  death.  And  mystically,  sinners  were  sitting  in  darkness, 
ie.  in  dark  errors,  vices,  and  sins.  S.  Chrysostom  and  others  by 
darkness  understand  errors,  by  the  shadow  of  death  sins;  it  is 
better,  though,  to  take  each  expression  as  applying  to  both ; so  that 
darkness  means  common  errors  and  faults,  and  the  shadow  of  death 
serious  errors  and  wickedness. 

To  guide  our  feet  into  the  way  of  peace . That  is,  that  Christ  by 
the  light  of  His  faith  and  grace  may  direct  us  into  the  way  of 
righteousness ; for  this  is  the  way  of  peace ; for  righteousness  is  the 
way  and  means  to  attain  peace  and  tranquillity  of  mind ; both  peace 
with  God  and  men  in  this  life,  and  beatific  peace  in  heaven  ; accord- 
ing to  Isaiah  xxxii.  17.  And  the  work  of  righteousness  shall  be 
peace , . . . and  my  people  shall  dwell  in  the  beauty  of  peace,  and  in  sure 
dwellings ; for  by  peace  the  Hebrews  signify  every  blessing,  and 
eternal  felicity  and  beatitude  itself.  Hence  Christ  is  called  by 
Isaiah  (ix.  6),  The  Prince  of  peace  and  the  Father  of  the  coming  age; 
and  he  adds,  of  peace  there  shall  be  no  end 

Ver.  80. — And  the  child  grew,  &c.  As  John  grew  in  body,  so  also 
he  waxed  strong  in  spirit,  because  the  Holy  Spirit  from  day  to  day 
filled  him  with  greater  wisdom,  grace,  and  strength.  Hence  we 
conclude  that  the  use  of  reason,  which  was  bestowed  upon  John  in 
the  womb,  continued  after  his  nativity  and  increased.  So  Theo- 
phylact  says,  “ The  more  the  child  grew,  the  more  the  powers  of  the

JOHN'S  RETIREMENT  INTO  THE  DESERT. 


71 


Spirit  were  manifested  in  him,  being  an  organ  capable  of  receiving 
them.”  And  Titos  says,  “according  to  the  proportion  and  increase 
of  his  age,  he  advanced  in  grace  and  spirit”  The  same  is  said  ol 
the  child  Jesus,  bat  after  a different  manner  and  sense. 

And  was  m the  deserts.  Hence  we  conclude  that  John  from  a 
boy  retired  into  the  desert,  and  there  remained  till  his  thirtieth 
year,  when  he  began  to  show  himself  to  the  people,  and  to  preach 
repentance  to  them,  and  faith  in  Christ 

Baronius  is  of  opinion  that  this  retirement  and  flight  of  John 
into  the  desert  took  place  through  fear  of  the  infanticide  Herod ; 
for  although  John  was  not  living  in  the  coasts  of  Bethlehem,  yet  on 
account  of  the  fame  of  his  wonderful  nativity  the  fear  and  anger 
of  Herod  extended  to  him;  for  fearing  that  he  was  the  king  of 
the  Jews,  ue.  the  Messiah,  whom  the  Magi  were  asking  for,  he 
commanded  him  to  be  killed.  Wherefore,  that  he  might  not  be 
murdered  by  Herod,  he  was  taken  away  by  his  mother  when  two 
years  old  into  the  desert;  and  was  hidden  there  in  a cave. 
Cedrenus  adds,  that  his  mother  died  after  forty  days  in  the  same 
cave,  and  that  an  angel  undertook  the  charge  of  bringing  up  John. 
Peter  Alexandrinus  adds,  that  Herod  commanded  his  father 
Zacharias  to  be  killed  between  the  temple  and  the  altar,  because 
he  had  removed  his  son  out  of  the  way. 

The  cause,  therefore,  of  the  retirement  of  John  into  the  desert 
was  the  fear  of  Herod ; but  there  were  besides  other  and  greater 
causes  both  on  the  part  of  God  and  John.  The  first  was  that  in 
the  desert  he  might  avoid  the  occasions  of  sinning  which  are 
supplied  by  associating  with  men.  The  second  was  that  he  might 
freely  reprehend  the  vices  of  the  Jews  without  fear  of  any  one, 
inasmuch  as  he  knew  no  one,  but  like  an  angel  come  down  from 
heaven,  preached  heavenly  truths.  Theophylact  says,  “He  de- 
parted that  he  might  be  brought  up  beyond  the  reach  of  the  malice 
of  the  multitude,  and  might  not  be  afraid  of  censuring  any  one. 
The  third  cause  was,  that  as  a future  preacher  of  repentance  he 
might  himself  first  give  a pattern  of  it  by  living  severely  in  the 
desert ; for  austerity  of  life  gives  great  power  to  a preacher.  The

fourth  was  that  by  conversing  continually  with  God  and  the  angels, 
he  might  lead  an  angelic  life ; according  to  the  words,  Behold \ I send 
My  angel \ and  he  shall  prepare  the  way  before  Me , Mai.  iii.  i.  For 
John,  living  apart  from  the  world  in  the  desert,  had  time  for  fasting, 
prayer,  and  contemplation ; “ that,”  as  Origen  says,  “ he  might  have 
leisure  for  prayer,  and  might  hold  converse  with  the  angels,  and 
call  upon  God,  and  hear  Him  answering  and  saying,  4 Behold,  here  I 
am.’”  The  fifth  was  that  he  might  be  a witness  to  Christ  above  all 
exception ; for  in  the  desert  he  could  have  been  taught  by  no  man, 
but  only  by  God  and  the  angels.  Wherefore  he  was  taught  of  God 
falUdaxrtc.  John  therefore  in  the  desert  was  an  inhabitant  of 
heaven,  both  because  he  had  the  heaven  for  a home  and  a roof, 
and  because  by  continually  contemplating  heaven,  he  in  mind 
dwelt  in  heaven,  and  emulated  the  life  of  those  who  dwell  in 
heaven. 

Gregory  Nazianzen  (in  orat.  20  in  praise  of  S.  Basil)  calls  John 
the  highest  Philosopher;  “Basil,”  he  says,  “retired  hence  with 
us  to  Pontus,  and  ruled  over  the  schools  of  piety  which  were  in 
those  parts,  and  with  Elias  and  John,  the  greatest  philosophers, 
embraces  solitude.”  Elias  of  Crete,  commenting  on  orat  1 of 
S.  Gregory,  gives  another  reason  for  the  solitary  life  of  John ; 
“Since  Christ  and  John  were  relations,  therefore  lest  John  might 
seem  to  bear  witness  to  Christ  because  of  his  relationship  to  Him, 
it  was  brought  about  by  the  grace  of  the  Holy  Spirit  that  he  should 
lead  a solitary  life  during  the  whole  period  of  his  early  years,  that  he 
might  nt»t  seem  to' give  this  testimony  (to  Christ)  through  friend- 
ship of  through  some  kind  of  artifice,  but  that  he  might  announce 
the  very  fact  as  if  he  had  learnt  it  from  God ; and  therefore  he 
said  : I knew  Him  not ; but  He  that  sent  me  to  baptize  with  water, 
the  same  said  unto  me,  4 Upon  Whom  thou  shalt  see  the  Spirit 
descending  like  a dove,  and  remaining  on  Him,  the  same  is  He 
which  baptizeth  with  the  Holy  Ghost’” 

Symbolically,  Nicetas  (in  orat.  38  on  S.  Greg.  Naxianzen ),  says, 
44  John  is  a figure  of  those  who  are  sanctified  from  childhood,  and 
by  going  onwards  to  the  end  preserve  a most  pious  and  constant

habit  of  virtue.  For  when  as  jet  he  was  in  his  mother’s  womb, 
he  recognised  his  Lord,  and  leapt  with  great  joy.” 

Lastly,  the  same  S.  Gregory  Nazianzen,  following  the  example  of 
S.  John,  retired  with  S.  Basil  into  solitude,  the  spiritual  delights 
and  fruits  of  which  he  thus  describes  (prat  1) : — “ Nothing  seemed 
to  me  so  much  to  be  desired  by  any  one  as  that  a man  should  lead 
a life  superior  to  those  things  which  we  behold  with  our  bodily  eyes, 
with  closed  senses  placed  where  he  is  free  from  the  desires  of  the 
flesh  and  the  world,  and,  except  as  far  as  necessity  requires,  coming 
into  contact  with  no  human  things,  and  holding  converse  with 
himself  and  with  God.  Such  a man  ever  bears  about  in  himself 
visions  of  Divine  purity,  unmingled  with  any  earthly  and  delusive 
forms ; and  he  is  altogether  a pure  mirror  of  the  things  of  God  and 
of  Divine  things,  and  receives  light  by  means  of  light  (that  is  to 
say,  a clearer  light  by  means  of  that  which  is  less  dear),  and  already 
in  hope  beholds  the  blessedness  of  the  future  life,  and  holds 
converse  with  the  angels,  and  though  still  on  earth  he  leaves  earth 
behind,  and  is  placed  on  high  by  the  Spirit”  Wherefore  the 
Fathers  speak  everywhere  of  John  as  a prince  of  the  monastic  life, 
of  which  Christ  was  the  Leader ; as  I have  shewn,  S.  Matt  iv.  1.

CHAPTER  IL 

I  Augustus  taxetn  all  the  Roman  empire.  6 The  nativity  of  Christ:  8 one  angel 
relateth  it  to  the  shepherds  : 13  many  sing  praises  to  God  for  it.  21  Christ  is 
circumcised:  22  Mary  purified.  28  Simeon  and  Anna  prophesy  of  Christ:  40 
who  increaseth  in  wisdom , 46  questioneth  in  the  temple  with  the  doctors , 5 l and 
is  obedient  to  his  parents. 

AND  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days,  that  there  went  out  a decree  from  Caesar 
Augustas,  that  all  the  world  should  be  taxed. 

2  ( And  this  taxing  was  first  made  when  Cyrenius  was  governor  of  Syria.) 

3  And  all  went  to  be  taxed,  every  one  into  his  own  city. 

4  And  Joseph  also  went  up  from  Galilee,  out  of  the  city  of  Nazareth,  into 
Judaea,  unto  the  city  of  David,  which  is  called  Bethlehem  ; (because  he  was  of 
the  house  and  lineage  of  David  :) 

5  To  be  taxed  with  Mary  his  espoused  wife,  being  great  with  child. 

6  And  so  it  was,  that,  while  they  were  there,  the  days  were  accomplished 
that  she  should  be  delivered. 

7  And  she  brought  forth  her  firstborn  son,  and  wrapped  him  in  swaddling 
clothes,  and  laid  him  in  a manger ; because  there  was  no  room  for  them  in  the 
inn. 

8  And  there  were  in  the  same  country  shepherds  abiding  in  the  field,  keeping 
watch  over  their  flock  by  night 

9  And,  lo,  the  angel  of  the  Lord  came  upon  them,  and  the  glory  of  the  Lord 
shone  round  about  them  : and  they  were  sore  afraid. 

10  And  the  angel  said  unto  them.  Fear  not : for,  behold,  I bring  you  good 
tidings  of  great  joy,  which  shall  be  to  all  people. 

11  For  unto  you  is  bom  this  day  in  the  city  of  David  a Saviour,  which  is 
Christ  the  Lord. 

12  And  this  shall  be  a sign  unto  you ; Ye  shall  find  the  babe  wrapped  in 
swaddling  clothes,  lying  in  a manger. 

13  And  suddenly  there  was  with  the  angel  a multitude  of  the  heavenly  host 
praising  God,  and  saying, 

14  Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good  will  toward  men. 

15  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  the  angels  were  gone  away  from  them  into  heaven, 
the  shepherds  said  one  to  another,  Let  us  now  go  even  unto  Bethlehem,  and  see 
this  thing  which  is  come  to  pass,  which  the  Lord  hath  made  known  unto  us. 

16  And  they  came  with  haste,  and  found  Mary,  and  Joseph,  and  the  babe 
lying  in  a manger. 

17  And  when  they  had  seen  it,  they  made  known  abroad  the  saying  which  was 
told  them  concerning  this  child

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  S.  LUKE.  75 

18  And  all  they  that  heard  it  wondered  at  those  things  which  were  told  them 
by  the  shepherds. 

19  But  Mary  kept  all  these  things,  and  pondered  them  in  her  heart 

20  And  the  shepherds  returned,  glorifying  and  praising  God  for  all  the  things 
that  they  had  heard  and  seen,  as  it  was  told  unto  them. 

21  And  when  eight  days  were  accomplished  for  the  circumcising  of  the  child, 
his  name  was  called  JESUS,  which  was  so  named  of  the  angel  before  he  was 
conceived  in  the  womb. 

22  And  when  the  days  of  her  purification  according  to  the  law  of  Moses  were 
accomplished,  they  brought  him  to  Jerusalem,  to  present  him  to  the  Lord  ; 

23  (As  it  is  written  in  the  law  of  the  Lord,  Every  male  that  openeth  the  womb 
shall  be  called  holy  to  the  Lord ;) 

24  And  to  offer  a sacrifice  according  to  that  which  is  said  in  the  law  of  the 
Lord,  A pair  of  turtledoves,  or  two  young  pigeons. 

25  And,  behold,  there  was  a man  in  Jerusalem,  whose  name  was  Simeon  ; 
and  the  same  man  was  just  and  devout,  waiting  for  the  consolation  of  Israel : and 
the  Holy  Ghost  was  upon  him. 

26  And  it  was  revealed  unto  him  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  that  he  should  not  see 
death,  before  he  had  seen  the  Lord's  Christ. 

27  And  he  came  by  the  Spirit  into  the  temple  : and  when  the  parents  brought 
in  the  child  Jesus,  to  do  for  him  after  the  custom  of  the  law, 

28  Then  took  he  him  up  in  his  arms,  and  blessed  God,  and  said, 

29  Lord,  now  lettest  thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  according  to  thy  word  : 

30  For  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation, 

31  Which  thou  hast  prepared  before  the  face  of  all  people ; 

32  A light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles,  and  the  glory  of  thy  people  Israel 

33  And  Joseph  and  his  mother  marvelled  at  those  things  which  were  spoken 
of  him. 

34  And  Simeon  blessed  them,  and  said  unto  Mary  his  mother,  Behold,  this 
child  is  set  for  the  fall  and  rising  again  of  many  in  Israel ; and  for  a sign  which 
shall  be  spoken  against ; 

35  (Yea,  a sword  shall  pierce  through  thy  own  soul  also,)  that  the  thoughts  of 
many  hearts  may  be  revealed. 

36  And  there  was  one  Anna  a prophetess,  the  daughter  of  Phanuel,  of  the 
tribe  of  Aser  : she  was  of  great  age,  and  had  lived  with  an  husband  seven  years 
from  her  virginity ; 

37  And  she  was  a widow  of  about  fourscore  and  four  years,  which  departed 
not  from  the  temple,  but  served  God  with  fastings  and  prayers  night  and  day. 

38  And  she  coming  in  that  instant  gave  thanks  likewise  unto  the  Lord,  and 
spake  of  him  to  all  them  that  looked  for  redemption  in  Jerusalem. 

39  And  when  they  had  performed  all  things  according  to  the  law  of  the  Lord, 
they  returned  into  Galilee,  to  their  own  city  Nazareth. 

40  And  the  child  grew,  and  waxed  strong  in  spirit,  filled  with  wisdom : and 
the  grace  of  God  was  upon  him. 

41  Now  his  parents  went  to  Jerusalem  every  year  at  the  feast  of  the  passover. 

42  And  when  he  was  twelve  years  old,  they  went  up  to  Jerusalem  after  the 
custom  of  the  feast. 

43  And  when  they  had  fulfilled  the  days,  as  they  returned,  the  child  Jesus 
tarried  behind  in  Jerusalem  ; and  Joseph  and  his  mother  knew  not  of  it.

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


44  Bat  they,  supposing  him  to  have  been  in  the  company,  went  a day’s 
journey  ; and  they  sought  him  among  their  kinsfolk  and  acquaintance. 

45  And  when  they  found  him  not,  they  turned  back  again  to  Jerusalem,  seeking 
him. 

46  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  after  three  days  they  found  him  in  the  temple, 
sitting  in  the  midst  of  the  doctors,  both  hearing  them,  and  asking  them  questions. 

47  And  all  that  heard  him  were  astonished  at  his  understanding  and  answers. 

48  And  when  they  saw  him,  they  were  amazed  : and  his  mother  said  unto  him, 
Son,  why  hast  thou  thus  dealt  with  us?  behold,  thy  father  and  I have  sought  thee 
sorrowing. 

49  And  he  said  unto  them,  How  is  it  that  ye  sought  me?  wist  ye  not  that  I 
must  be  about  my  Father’s  business  ? 

50  And  they  understood  not  the  saying  which  he  spake  unto  them. 

51  And  he  went  down  with  them,  and  came  to  Nazareth,  and  was  subject  unto 
them : but  his  mother  kept  all  these  sayings  in  her  heart. 

52  And  Jesus  increased  in  wisdom  and  stature,  and  in  favour  with  God  and  man. 

Ver.  1. — And  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days  (in  which  John  the 
Baptist  was  born)  there  went  forth  a decree,  &c.  The  Syriac  for  “ all 
the  world,”  has  “ all  the  people  of  his  dominion,”  subject,  that  is, 
to  Augustus  and  the  Romans.  For  we  have  the  authority  of 
Suetonius  that  Augustus  did  not  rule  over  the  Goths,  the 
Armenians,  or  the  Indians.  This  enrolment  was  made,  both  that 
the  number  of  men  under  the  sway  of  Augustus  might  be 
known,  and  also  with  a view  to  collecting  the  tribute  to  be 
taken  to  the  Roman  treasury,  exhausted  by  so  many  wars ; for  each 
person  gave  in  an  account  of  his  income.  It  is  probable  that  the 
Jews  gave  what  they  otherwise  gave  in  taxes  according  to  their 
law,  half  a shekel  apiece,  that  is  two  reals.  Exod.  xxx.  n-16; 
Matt  xxii.  19. 

From  Ccesar.  The  true  name  of  this  Caesar  was  Octavius  or 
Octavian,  the  sister’s  son  of  Julius.  He  being  the  first  Monarch  of 
Rome,  extended  the  glory  of  the  empire  and  added  to  it  in  a won- 
derful degree ; hence  he  received  the  surname  of  Augustus  in  the 
eighteenth  year  of  his  reign  (from  which  date  Censorinus  reckons  the 
years  of  Augustus,  and  calls  them  the  Augustian  or  Augustsean  years) 
as  though  he  were  some  divinity  come  down  from  heaven.  For  he 
reigned  in  the  greatest  peace,  plenty,  splendour,  and  felicity  for  fifty- 
seven  years.  Hence  the  proverb,  “ Happier  than  Augustus,  better 
than  Trajan.”  This  census  was  taken  by  Augustus  when  he  had

the  whole  world  in  a state  of  peace,  and  had  therefore  closed  the 
temple  of  Janus  for  the  third  time,  in  the  fortieth  year  of  his  reign. 
And  all  this  happened  under  the  guidance  of  God,  that  He  might 
signify  that  Christ  was  now  born,  who  was  to  bring  peace  to  all  the 
world.  So  Bede,  “ A lover  of  peace,  He  would  be  born  in  a time  of 
the  most  profound  quiet  And  there  could  be  no  plainer  indication 
of  peace  than  that  a census  should  be  taken  of  the  whole  world, 
whose  master  Augustus  was,  having  reigned  at  the  time  of  Christ’s 
nativity  for  some  twelve  years  in  the  greatest  peace,  war  being  lulled 
to  sleep  throughout  all  the  world.”  Wherefore  the  Virgin  Mother  of 
God  appeared  to  Augustus  in  the  Capitol  bearing  the  Infant  in  her 
arms,  Augustus  himself  having  already  learned  from  the  Oracle  of 
Apollo  that  a Hebrew  child  was  bom  who  had  imposed  silence 
upon  the  Oracles  of  Idols,  and  having  erected  an  altar  in  the 
Capitol  with  the  title,  “The  Altar  of  the  Firstborn  of  God.”  Hence 
Constantine  the  Great  built  on  that  spot  a temple  to  the  memory  of 
Mary,  Mother  of  God,  which  exists  to  this  day,  and  is  commonly 
called  the  “Ara  Cceli”  There  too  the  place  is  shown  where 
Augustus  saw  the  vision.  So  Baronius,  following  Suidas,  Nicephorus, 
and  others,  in  the  materials  of  his  “Annals.”  Moreover,  in  the 
same  reign  there  flowed  out  of  the  earth,  in  the  shop  of  a certain 
deserving  man,  at  Rome,  a plentiful  fountain  of  oil,  which  lasted 
the  whole  day;  and  the  spot  is  still  shown  in  the  Church  of  St 
Maria  in  Trastevere.  “ By  this  sign,”  says  Osorius,  book  vi.  ch.  20, 
“what  more  plainly  declared  than  the  birth  of  Christ  in  the  reign 
of  Caesar  Augustus  ? ” “ For  4 Christ  * being  interpreted  is  4 The 
Anointed’” — because  He  hath  anointed  us,  and  doth  anoint  us 
with  the  oil  of  grace  and  of  gladness  through  all  the  days  of  our 
mortal  life.  The  question  arises,  In  what  year  of  Augustus  was 
Christ  boro?  The  opinions  of  the  learned  and  of  chronologists 
differ  on  this  point  The  first  opinion  is  that  Christ  was  born  in  the 
41st  Julian  year,  the  40th  of  the  reign  of  Augustus,  the  36th  of 
Herod,  that  is,  A.U.C.  749,  the  fourth  year  of  Olympiad  193.  The 
Julian  years  date  from  that  in  which  Julius  Caesar  reformed  the 
calendar,  the  last  year  but  one  of  his  life.  This  opinion  agrees

very  well  with  Sacred  and  Profane  histories.  The  only  objection  to 
it  is  that  in  S.  Luke  iii.  i and  23.  It  is  said  of  Christ  that  when 
He  was  baptized  He  “was  beginning  to  be  about  thirty  years 
old,”  while  according  to  this  view  He  must  have  been  thirty- 
two,  or  nearly  as  much,  for  Augustus  reigned  fifty-seven  years. 
The  answer  given  to  this  is  that  Christ  is  called  about  thirty  years, 
because  He  was  thirty-two.  In  the  same  way  S.  Augustine  is  said 
in  the  old  Breviaries  to  have  been  baptized  in  his  thirtieth  year, 
when  he  really  was  thirty-three,  as  the  lately  corrected  Breviaries 
have  it 

The  second  opinion  is  that  Christ  was  born  in  the  41st  year  of 
Augustus,  A.U.C.  750.  So  think  Sulpicius  Severus  and  S.  Jerome; 
Irenseus  and  Tertullian  also  are  inclined  to  this  opinion. 

The  third  places  the  date  in  the  42nd  year  of  Augustus,  A.U.C. 
751.  So  Clement  of  Alexandria  and  Cassiodonus  among  the 
ancients,  Scaliger  and  the  Martyrologium  Romanum  for  the  25th 
December  among  the  modems.  I have  accordingly  taken  this 
date  in  the  Chronological  Chart  which  I have  prefixed  to  the 
Pentateuch. 

The  fourth  is  the  43d  of  Augustus,  A.U.C.  752.  So  S. 
Epiphanius,  Eusebius,  Nicephorus,  and  others.  Francis  Suarez, 
Maldonatus,  and  others  incline  to  this  opinion. 

The  fifth  makes  it  the  44th  of  Augustus,  A.U.C.  753.  So  Joannes 
Lucidus,  and  Dionysius  Exiguus  with  their  followers. 

The  sixth  is  the  45th  of  Augustus,  A.U.C.  754.  So  Paul  of 
Middlesburgh,  Bishop  of  Sempronia,  Peter  of  Aliacum,  Bellarmine, 
and  Bede ; and  very  recently,  but  with  great  exactitude,  our  own 
Petavius,  in  the  “ Rationarium  Temporum.” 

All  these  opinions  have  their  probabilities  and  also  their  difficulties. 
In  a matter  of  so  much  doubt  there  can  be  no  certainty  of  definition. 
With  the  first  the  early  Annals  in  Epiphanius  expressly  agree,  the 
old  Chronicle  in  Eusebius,  and  an  anonymous  chronologist  writing 
1400  years  ago.  In  its  favour  there  is  also,  first,  that  in  that  year 
the  temple  of  Janus  was  shut,  and  there  was  the  greatest  peace  in 
the  world,  as  I have  said.  Secondly,  that  Herod  in  the  37th  year

THE  YEAR  OF  CHRIST’S  BIRTH.

of  his  reign  (the  41st  of  Augustus),  and  a little  before  his  death, 
ordered  the  children  under  two  years  to  be  slain,  Matt  iL  Christ 
must,  therefore,  have  then  been  in  His  second  year.  This  argument  is 
strong,  and  can  scarcely  be  solved  except  by  torturing  the  expression 
“ a bimatu  ” [Greek  Airoug].  Thirdly,  Christ  must  have  been 
bom  in  a leap  year,  as  is  clear  if  we  count  back  from  the  present 
to  the  birth  of  Christ,  for  every  hundredth  year  is  a leap  year.  But 
the  40th  year  of  Augustus  was  a leap  year,  and  the  41st  and  42d 
were  not  For  the  first  year  of  the  Julian  Era  was  a leap  year,  as 
Macrobius,  Censorious  and  others  tell  us,  and  therefore  the  tenth 
leap  year  of  the  Era  must  have  been  the  year  41 — or  the  40th  year 
of  Augustus.  Besides  which,  it  is  clear  from  Josephus,  Dion, 
Hegesippus,  and  others,  that  Herod  ruled  altogether  thirty-seven 
years,  and  died  in  the  year  43  of  the  Julian  Era,  before  the  Passover . 
Therefore  Christ  could  not  have  been  bom  under  him  in  that  or  any 
following  year  in  the  end  of  the  year — namely,  in  December. 

Lastly,  this  was  the  year  in  which  Augustus  introduced  to  the 
Forum,  with  great  pomp,  his  grandson  Caius  Caesar, — the  son  of  his 
daughter  Julia  and  his  son-in-law  Marcus  Agrippa — he,  on  that 
occasion,  laying  aside  the  “toga  prsetexta,”  and  putting  on  the 
“ virilis  ” — according  to  the  Roman  custom.  For  Caius  was  bom 
AU.C.  734,  in  the  consulship  of  M.  Apuleius  and  P.  Silius— -as 
Lipsius  shows  from  Dio,  from  the  stone  of  Ancyra,  and  from  other 
documents.  Therefore  A.U.C.  749  must  have  been  that  in  which 
he  assumed  the  “ toga  virilis  ” — he  then  entering  on  his  sixteenth 
year. 

In  this  same  year  it  was  that  God  the  Father  introduced  to  the 
world  His  Son  Jesus  Christ,  the  Lord  of  Heaven  and  Earth,  that 
through  Him  He  might  adopt  as  sons  all  that  believed  in  Him,  and 
make  them  heirs  of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven. 

From  this  view  likewise  we  may  easily  understand  why  Christ  did 
not  come  to  Jerusalem  before  the  twelfth  year  of  His  age ; namely, 
because  Archelaus,  the  son  of  Herod,  reigned  there  until  that  year, 
and  he,  like  his  father,  was  a source  of  danger  to  Christ  Archelaus 
reigned  ten  years,  add  to  these  the  two  last  years  of  Herod  and

we  have  the  twelve  years,  after  which  Archelaus  was  driven  into 
exile,  and  then  Christ  freely  and  without  fear  went  to  the  Temple 
at  Jerusalem. 

Ver.  2. — And  this  taxing  was  first  made  when  Cyrenius  was 
governor  of  Syria.  Firsts  that  is  general , — throughout  all  the  world, 
which  had  now  been  lulled  into  peace  under  Augustus  and  the 
Romans;  for  there  was  a particular  census  taken  in  several  pro- 
vinces prior  to  this  general  one.  So  Paulus  Orosius,  Bede,  Mai- 
donatus,  Jansenius,  Toletus,  Franciscus  Lucas  and  others.  Firsts 
again,  because  a second  was  taken  ten  years  after,  when  Cyrenius 
was  sent  to  Syria  to  superintend  it,  for  the  purpose  of  confiscating 
the  property  of  Archelaus  who  was  then  exiled; — see  Josephus, 
Antiq.  bk.  xviii.,  ch.  i.  Tertullian,  “ against  Marcion”  bk.  iv.,  ch. 
7,  19,  and  36,  says  that  this  first  enrolment  was  made  under 
Sentius  Saturninus,  who  was  sent  expressly  for  the  purpose  by 
Augustus  at  the  time  when  Cyrenius  was  governor  of  Syria  in  all 
things, — and,  consequently,  with  respect  to  this  census  as  well  Or, 
according  to  others,  Cyrenius  began  the  census,  and,  being  called 
away  to  a war  against  the  Homonadians— over  whom  he  shortly 
after  triumphed — left  it  to  Saturninus  to  finish. 

Hence  it  follows  that  this  enrolment  and  census  was  not  a 
lustral  or  quinquennial,  but  a new  and  universal  one ; the  second 
and  most  celebrated  of  the  three  made  by  Augustus,  in  the 
Consulship  of  Censorinus  and  Asinius,  as  the  stone  of  Ancyra, 
Suetonius,  and  Josephus,  Antiq.  xvil,  ch.  3,  have  it  The  first 
census  was  that  which  Augustus  took  twenty  years  before  in  his 
sixth  consulate  and  the  seventeenth  year  of  his  reign,  M.  Agrippa 
his  son-in-law  being  his  colleague,  while  the  third  was  twenty  years 
after,  in  the  last  year  of  his  reign  and  his  life,  with  Tiberius,  who 
had  married  Julia  at  the  death  of  Agrippa,  his  mother  Livia  having 
married  Augustus. 

The  time  occupied  in  making  one  of  these  enrolments  was  five 
years. 

Cyrenius.  This  was  P.  Sulpitius  Quirinus,  Cyrinus,  or  Cyrinius 
whom  Augustus  had  appointed  tutor  to  Caius  Caesar  when  he  went

THE  ENROLMENT  AT  BETHLEHEM.

to  Syria,  and  whom  he  ordered  to  remain  as  governor  when  Cains 
died  there,  as  Velleius  the  companion  of  Cains,  Suetonius,  Floras, 
Dio,  and  others  record. 

Ver.  3. — And  all  went  to  detoxed,  every  one  into  kis  own  city . To 
the  cities  from  which  their  respective  families  took  their  origin ; as 
the  house  of  David,  of  which  Joseph  and  Christ  were  born,  took 
theirs  from  Bethlehem ; David  having  been  born  and  brought  up 
in  Bethlehem.  The  Jews  had  divided  their,  nation  into  twelve 
tribes  and  these  again  into  different  families,  and  so  the  Romans, 
in  taking  the  census  among  them,  followed  this  division. 

Indeed  all  this  was  taking  place  under  the  direction  of  God, 
that  it  might  be  clear  to  the  whole  world  that  Christ,  then  newly 
bom  in  Bethlehem,  was  of  the  tribe  of  Judah  and  the  house 
of  David,  and  that  He  was  the  Messiah,  as  the  Prophets  had 
foretold. 

To  be  taxed — The  Greek  dT*yzd<fx6tai  means  both  to  be  enrolled 
and  to  make  a declaration . Each  one  was  enrolled,  and  made  a 
declaration  of  allegiance  to  him  who  enrolled  him,  namely:  to 
Cyrenius,  as  the  vicegerent  of  Augustus.  For  at  Rome  all  as 
to  whose  loyalty  towards  Augustus  and  the  Senate  there  was  no 
doubt,  were  enrolled  as  citizens  and  subjects,  but  elsewhere  they 
were  said  to  make  a declaration  of  allegiance,  as  being  foreigners 
subdued  by  the  Roman  arms.  Orosius,  book  vL,  last  chapter, 
infers  from  this  enrolment  that  Christ  was  a Roman  citizen,  that 
He  might,  as  it  were,  tacitly  signify  that  all  Christians  must  be 
subjects  to  the  Roman  Pontiff  and  Church. 

Symbolically,  by  this  enrolment  is  signified  the  coming  of  Christ 
to  free  us  from  the  servitude  of  the  devil,  and  subdue  all  the 
world  to  His  faith  and  worship,  not  by  force  of  arms,  but  by  the 
efficacy  of  His  grace;  and  for  this  cause  it  was  that  Augustus 
at  that  time  refused  the  title  of  “Lord,”  as  Orosius  and  others 
testify. 

Again,  S.  Gregory,  Homily  viii.  in  Evang.,  says,  “ Why  is  it  that  a 
census  of  all  the  world  is  taken  when  the  Lord  is  about  to  be  bom, 
except  that  it  is  by  this  means  clearly  shown  that  He  was  appearing

in  the  flesh  who  should  enrol  His  elect  in  eternity?  For,  on  the 
other  hand,  it  is  said  of  the  reprobate  by  the  Prophet,  Let  them  be 
blotted  out  of  the  book  of  the  living,  and  not  be  written  with 
the  Just”  So  too  Origen:  “To  one  who  regards  the  matter 
attentively  it  seems  to  present  a kind  of  mystery,  as  though,  in  the 
enrolment  of  the  whole  world,  it  behoved  Christ  too  to  be  enrolled, 
that  being  enrolled  with  all  other  men  He  might  sanctify  all,  and 
that  having  entered  in  the  census  with  all  the  world,  He  might 
grant  to  the  world  something  in  common  with  Himself.” 

Hence  it  appears  that  Christ  was  enrolled  not  immediately  after 
His  birth,  but  eight  days  after  His  circumcision ; for  at  His 
circumcision  the  name  of  Jesus  was  given  Him,  and,  in  the 
presence  of  the  inhabitants  of  Bethlehem,  who  were  of  the  house 
of  David,  entered  on  the  public  tablets  which  Cyrenius  forwarded 
to  Augustus,  to  wit  that  Jesus  the  Son  of  Mary  was  born  in 
Bethlehem,  of  the  lineage  of  David.  So  Justin  “ ApoL  ii.,  ad  Antoni- 
num  Pium,”  Origen,  and  others. 

Ver.  6. — And  so  it  was  that , while  they  were  there , the  days  were 
accomplished  that  she  should  be  delivered  Here  the  prophecy  of 
Micah,  v.  2,  that  Christ  should  be  born  in  Bethlehem,  was  ful- 
filled. 

Went  up — from  Nazareth,  where,  at  the  annunciation  of  the  angel, 
the  Blessed  Virgin  had  conceived  Christ  Hence  Christ  was  called 
by  the  Jews  a Galilean  and  a Nazarene. 

To  Bethlehem , which  was  beyond  Jerusalem,  and  two  hours 
journey  from  it;  so  that  from  Nazareth  to  Bethlehem  was  a journey 
of  three  days  or  more,  and  the  Blessed  Virgin,  though  near  her 
delivery,  accomplished  it,  as  many  piously  suppose,  on  foot  S. 
Bernard,  in  his  sermon  on  the  words  “A  great  sign  appeared  in 
heaven  ” of  the  Apocalypse,  says,  “ She  went  up  to  Bethlehem,  her 
delivery  being  now  at  hand,  bearing  that  most  precious  trust, 
bearing  a light  burden,  bearing  Him  by  whom  she  was  borne.  . . . 
She  alone  conceived  without  defilement,  carried  without  trouble,  and 
brought  forth  her  Son  without  pain.”  S.  Gregory,  Horn,  in  Evang., 
says,  “ And  well  is  He  bom  in  Bethlehem.  For  Bethlehem  means

THE  BIRTH  OF  JESUS.  83 

*The  House  of  Bread.1  And  He  it  is  who  says,  *1  am  the 
Living  Bread  that  came  down  from  Heaven.*  ” 

Her  days  were  accomplished.  She  brought  forth,  not  under  the 
influence  of  the  fatigue  of  the  journey,  but  naturally. 

Observe  that  Christ  was  born  a little  after  the  winter  solstice, 
when  the  days  begin  to  increase,  John  the  Baptist  a little  after  the 
summer  solstice,  when  the  days  begin  to  decrease.  For,  as  John 
himself  said,  “He  must  increase,  but  I must  decrease.”  So  SL 
Augustine  remarks. 

Ver.  7. — And  she  brought  forth  her  firstborn  Son , and  wrapped 
Him  in  swaddling  clothes , and  laid  Him  in  a manger,  because  there 
was  no  room  for  Him  in  the  inn . She  brought  Him  forth  naturally 
like  other  mothers,  and  was,  therefore,  truly  and  naturally  the 
mother  of  Christ,  and  therefore  of  God,  for  Christ  is  God.  More- 
over the  Blessed  Virgin  was  more  the  parent  of  Christ  than  other 
mothers  are  of  their  children ; for  from  her  Christ  received  all  His 
substance,  and  other  sons  receive  it  not  only  from  their  mother 
and  but  also  from  their  father.  Hence  the  love  between  Christ 
His  mother  was  far  greater  than  that  between  other  mothers 
and  their  offspring,  for  the  love  which  is  divided  between  mother 
and  father  was,  in  the  case  of  the  Virgin,  united  and  kept 
together,  since  she  was  to  Him  in  place  of  both  mother 
and  father.  Secondly,  as  she  conceived  so  she  brought  forth, 
remaining  a virgin,  so  that  Christ  was  bom  while  the  womb  of 
his  mother  was  closed,  and  penetrated  as  the  rays  of  the  sun 
penetrate  glass. 

Thirdly,  the  Blessed  Virgin,  as  she  conceived  without  con- 
cupiscence, so  also  brought  forth  without  pain,  or  any  of  the 
concomitants  of  ordinary  childbirth.  So  say  the  Fathers  every- 
where. 

So  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  all  vigorous  and  in  good  health, 
absorbed  in  the  love  and  contemplation  of  her  Son,  each  moment 
expecting  His  birth,  and  longing  to  see  and  embrace  Him. 

And  she  herself  on  a certain  anniversary  of  the  Nativity  made 
a revelation  to  S.  Bridget,  as  the  latter  tells  us  in  book  vi.  ch.  88

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


of  her  Revelations,  saying,  “When  He  was  bom  of  me  He  went 
forth  from  my  closed  virgin  womb  with  unspeakable  joy  and 
exultation.  ...  I brought  Him  forth  as  thou  hast  now  seen  me, 
kneeling  alone  in  prayer  in  the  stable.  For,  with  such  exultation 
and  gladness  of  soul  did  I bear  Him  that  I felt  no  trouble  nor 
any  pain ; but  straightway  I wrapped  Him  in  the  clean  clothing 
which  I had  prepared  long  before.  And  when  Joseph  saw  these 
things,  he  marvelled  with  great  joy  and  gladness  that  I had  brought 
forth  without  assistance.”  And  in  the  “ Angelic  Discourse,”  ch. 
xv. — “God  Himself  bent  low  His  majesty,  and,  descending  into 
the  womb  of  the  Virgin  . . . formed  in  purest  fashion  from  the 
flesh  and  blood  of  the  Viigin  alone  His  Human  Body.  And 
therefore  is  that  most  chosen  Mother  fitly  likened  to  the  burning 
bush  which  Moses  saw,  that  took  no  hurt.  . . . Moreover  as,  when 
the  Son  of  God  was  conceived,  He  entered  throughout  the  whole 
body  of  the  Virgin  with  His  Divinity,  so,  when  he  was  bom 
with  His  Humanity  and  His  Godhead,  He  was  poured  forth 
throughout  her  body,  like  all  its  sweetness  shed  whole  from 
the  bosom  of  the  rose,  the  glory  of  maidenhood  remaining  entire 
in  His  Mother.” 

There  is  a question  as  to  what  place  was  the  first  to  receive 
Christ  at  His  birth.  Barradius  thinks  it  was  the  ground,  that 
Christ  might  teach  us  humility.  Others  think  that  Christ  was 
received  into  the  arms  of  His  Mother,  with  exceeding  joy, — for 
this  would  seem  to  be  becoming  for  such  a mother  and  such  a son, 
and  would  be  natural,  and  is  gathered  from  what  Luke  immediately 
adds,  “and  wrapped  Him  in  swaddling  clothes.”  Taking  Him  in 
her  hands  she  adored  Him,  kneeling,  and  then  kissed  Him  most 
sweetly,  and  wrapped  Him  in  the  clothes  and  bands.  Suarez 
thinks  that  Christ,  as  soon  as  He  was  bom,  was  laid  by  angels 
in  the  arms  of  His  most  holy  and  loving  Mother;  S.  Gregory  of 
Nyssa  implies  the  same.  This  would  be  the  place  most  becoming 
to  Him,  and  most  consonant  to  the  wishes  both  of  Son  and 
Mother ; and  from  thence  she  placed  Him  in  the  manger. 

S.  Bridget,  Revel  bk.  viii.  ch.  47,  implies  that,  at  His  birth,

MARY  ADORES  HER  NEW-BORN  SON.  85 

Christ  came  of  His  own  accord  into  the  hands  of  His  sweet 
Virgin  Mother,  and  this  may  be  piously  believed  with  great  pro- 
bability. 

Ribadaneira  says  that  there  is  a tradition  to  the  effect  that  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  as  soon  as  she  saw  Christ,  struck  with  wonder  at 
God  made  Man,  prostrated  herself  on  the  ground  before  Him, 
and,  with  the  deepest  reverence  and  joy  of  heart,  saluted  Him 
with  the  words,  Thou  art  come  to  one  who  has  longed  for  Thee, 
my  God ! my  Lord ! my  Son ! — not  doubting  that  she  was  under- 
stood by  Him,  infant  as  He  was ; and  that  thus  she  adored  Him, 
kissing  his  feet  as  God,  His  hands  as  her  Lord,  and  His  face  as 
her  Son. 

Christ,  says  S.  Bernard, 'sermon  4,  “On  the  Nativity,”  when  bom 
cried  and  shed  tears  like  other  infants ; both  that  He  might  begin 
to  weep  for  and  wash  away  our  sins  and  also  that  He  might 
conform  himself  to  other  infants ; as  Solomon,  who  was  a type 
of  Christ,  says,  “And  when  1 was  bora,  I drew  in  the  common 
air,  and  fell  upon  the  earth,  which  is  of  like  nature,  and  the  first 
voice  which  I uttered  was  crying,  as  all  others  do.  . . . For  there  is 
no  king  that  had  any  other  beginning  of  birth.”  Wisdom  vii.  3-5. 

All  the  angels  accompanied  Christ,  their  God  and  Lord,  to 
earth,  as  all  royal  households  accompany  a king  when  he  goes 
abroad.  They  were  amazed  at  God  the  immeasurable  as  it  were 
straitened  into  a span’s  breadth,  they  venerated  Him  and  adored 
Him.  Such  is  the  meaning  of  the  Apostle  where  he  says,  “ And 
again,  when  He  bringeth  His  Firstborn  into  the  world,  He  saith, 
And  let  all  the  angels  of  God  worship  Him,”  Heb.  i.  6. 

And  so  it  came  to  pass  that  this  stable  was,  as  it  were,  turned 
into  the  highest  heaven, — full  of  angels,  yea,  of  cherubim  and 
seraphim,  who  all,  leaving  heaven,  came  down  to  adore  their  God 
made  Man.  Such  was  the  work  of  the  Incarnation  and  Nativity 
of  the  Word, — hitherto  inconceivable,  and,  as  it  were,  incredible 
to  the  angels,  as  being  the  supreme  and  appropriate  work  of  the 
Divine  Power,  Wisdom,  Justice,  and  Clemency — surpassing  every 
understanding  of  men  and  ot  angels.

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


The  reasons  why  Christ  would  be  made  Man  and  born  on  earth 
were  many.  First,  that  suffering  and  dying  in  the  flesh  He  might 
redeem  us  from  our  sins  and  from  hell.  That  He  might  teach  us 
by  example  rather  than  word  the  way  of  salvation,  and  give  us  a 
perfect  specimen  of  sanctity  and  of  all  virtues,  but  especially  of 
the  most  profound  humility.  “ Dig  within  thyself,”  says  S. 
Augustine,  “the  foundation  of  humility,  and  so  shalt  thou  arrive 
at  the  summit  of  charity.” 

Another  reason  was  that  Christ  wished  to  become  our  kinsman 
and  brother,  nay,  our  very  flesh  and  blood,  in  order  that  He  might 
deal  as  flesh  with  flesh,  as  man  with  man,  as  equal  with  equaL 
Hence  S.  Bernard  {Serin.  3,  super  Missus  Est)  says,  “ He  has  been 
sent ; — let  us  strive  to  be  made  like  as  this  little  one ; let  us  learn 
of  Him,  for  He  is  meek  and  humble  of  heart,  lest  the  Great  God 
be  made  Man  to  no  purpose.” 

A third  reason  is,  that  Christ  took  upon  Him  the  meanness, 
the  lowliness,  the  ills  of  our  flesh,  not  for  Himself  but  for  us,  to 
prick  the  icy  hearts  of  men  with  the  effectual  stimulus  of  love  and 
stir  them  up, — nay,  force  them,  to  love  Him  in  return.  For  Christ, 
in  His  Incarnation,  is  ever  calling  aloud  to  us ; I have  given  Myself 
all  to  thee,  do  thou  in  turn  give  thyself  whole  to  Me.  For  this  did 
I take  flesh  upon  Me,  that  thou  mightest  say  with  Paul,  I live 
now  not  I,  but  Christ  lives  in  me.  Listen  to  S.  Ambrose, — u He 
therefore  was  a little  infant  that  thou  mightest  be  a perfect  man — 
He  swathed  in  bands  that  thou  mightest  be  freed  from  the  snares 
of  death — He  in  a crib  that  thou  mightest  be  on  the  altars — He 
on  earth  that  thou  mightest  be  in  heaven — He  had  not  room  in 
the  inn,  that  thou  mightest  have  more  abiding  places  among  the 
inhabitants  of  heaven.  . • . His  poverty,  therefore,  is  my  heritage, 
and  the  weakness  of  my  Lord  is  my  strength.” 

A fourth  reason  is  that  we  could  not  conceive  the  idea  of  God, 
who  is  a pure  and  uncreated  spirit,  so  God  clothed  Himself  in 
our  flesh  that  we  might  see  Him  with  our  eyes  and  hear  Him  with 
our  ears.  It  is  this  that  the  Church  sings  in  the  Preface  of  the 
Mass  of  the  Nativity ; — “ Because  by  the  Mystery  of  the  Incarnate

Word  a new  effulgence  of  Thy  glory  has  shone  upon  the  eyes  of 
our  soul,  that  coming  to  know  God  visibly  we  may  by  Him  be  rapt 
into  yearning  after  things  that  are  not  seen.” 

Firstborn — and  only  born.  The  firstborn  is  he  who  is  bom  first, 
though  no  other  be  begotten  after  him;  for  such  an  one  enjoys 
the  rights  and  privileges  of  primogeniture. 

And  wrapped  Him  in  swaddling  clothes — poor  and  cheap,  but 
dean  and  decent  Cyprian,  or  whoever  is  the  author  of  the  book, 
“ On  the  Chief  Works  of  Christ,”  in  serm.  i,  says,  “ In  place  of 
purple  some  rags  are  got  together,  instead  of  the  regal  equipage 
a few  fragments;  the  Mother  is  also  the  nurse  and  pays  devoted 
attention  to  her  beloved  Offspring.”  The  Ethiopian  version, 
instead  of  “ wrapped  Him  in  swaddling  clothes,”  has  u bound 
His  thumbs,”  as  though  this  were  the  sign  by  which  the  Infant 
was  recognised  by  the  shepherds.  This  is  connected  with  the 
Ethiopian  tradition  that  the  Queen  of  Sheba,  when  she  returned  to 
Ethiopia  from  her  visit  to  Solomon,  brought  forth  a son  called 
Menelich,  whom  she  had  conceived  by  him,  and  that  she  sent  this 
son  back  to  Jerusalem,  putting  on  his  thumb  the  ring  which 
Solomon  had  given  her,  that  by  this  sign  he  might  be  known  by 
his  father. 

And  laid  Him  in  a manger . Passing  over  the  various  opinions 
on  the  subject  recorded  by  Baronius  and  others,  we  may  note 
that  the  place  of  Christ's  birth  was  not  the  stable  belonging  to 
some  rustic  dwelling,  but  a cave  hewn  out  of  a rock  at  the  eastern 
end  of  the  city  of  Bethlehem.  This  is  on  the  authority  of  & 
Jerome,  “Ep.  18  ad  Marcellam,”  Bede,  Mde  Locis  Sanctis”  ch.  8, 
and  others.  Whether  the  cave  were  within  or  without  the  city  of 
Bethlehem  authorities  are  not  agreed.  Bede  says  that  a miraculous 
perennial  spring  took  its  rise  in  the  rock  of  the  cave,  and  was  still 
flowing  in  his  time ; he  also  records  that  the  whole  cave  was  cased 
in  marble  by  the  Christians,  and  adorned  with  a magnificent 
church  built  above  it  That  there  was  in  this  cave  a wooden 
manger,  well  known  to  all  the  shepherds  of  that  part,  is  clear  from 
the  fact,  that  the  shepherds  soon  found  the  spot  when  the  angel

indicated  it  to  them  by  this  sign.  This  manger  was  taken  from 
rhence  to  Rome,  and  there  placed  in  the  Basilica  of  S.  Maria 
Maggiore,  where  it  is  religiously  visited  and  venerated. 

Christ  was  placed  in  the  manger  for  two  reasons ; first,  because 
there  was  no  place  better  fitted  to  hold  Him — the  straw  in  it 
forming  a kind  of  bed  on  which  the  tender  babe  might  repose; 
and,  secondly,  that  in  the  rigour  of  winter,  He  might  be  warmed 
by  the  breath  of  the  ox  and  the  ass.  For  the  tradition  goes  that 
an  ox  and  an  ass  were  tethered  to  this  manger,  and  such  is  the 
common  belief  of  the  faithful.  Of  these  two  animals  the  Church 
interprets  the  words  of  Habakkuk  iii  2,  “In  the  midst  of  two 
animals  shalt  Thou  be  known”  (Vulgate),  and  appropriates  also 
Isaiah  i.  3,  “ The  ox  knoweth  his  owner,  and  the  ass  his  master’s 
crib,” — such  is  the  explanation  given  on  these  passages  by  S. 
Jerome,  Nazianzen,  Cyril,  Paulinus,  and  others,  quoted  by  Baronius. 

Gregory  of  Nyssa  “ On  the  Nativity”  gives  a mystical  reason  as 
follows : — “ A manger  is  the  dwelling-place  of  beasts ; in  such  a 
place  is  the  Word  born,  that  the  ox  may  know  his  owner,  and  the 
ass  the  resting-place  of  his  Lord.  Now,  the  ox  is  the  Jew  under  the 
yoke  of  the  Law ; and  the  ass  is  an  animal  fitted  for  bearing  burdens, 
— the  Gentile  groaning  under  the  grievous  burden  of  idolatry. 
Moreover,  the  ordinary  food  of  beasts  is  hay.  . . . But  the  rational 
animal  eats  bread,  wherefore  the  Bread  of  Life  which  came  down 
from  heaven  is  laid  in  the  crib  where  the  food  of  beasts  is  wont  to 
be  placed,  that  even  animals  void  of  reason  may  share  the  food  of 
reasonable  beings.” 

Many  mothers  of  Saints,  following  the  example  of  Christ,  have 
brought  forth  their  sons  in  a stable.  The  mother  of  S.  Francis, 
being  pregnant,  and  unable  to  gave  birth  to  her  child,  advised  by  a 
poor  pilgrim  to  betake  herself  to  a stable,  did  as  she  was  told,  and 
there  gave  birth  to  S.  Francis,  the  imitator  of  Christ’s  poverty.  So 
says  Ribadaneira  in  his  life.  Let  all  Christians  look  at  and  contem- 
plate Christ  in  the  manger,  and  consider  Who  and  What  He  is, 
— what  He  does,  for  whom  and  why  He  does  it  For  Christ  in  the 
manger,  God  made  Man,  the  Word  become  a babe, — is  the  love

and  admiration  of  all  the  angels  and  all  the  faithful,  at  whom  they 
stand  amazed  and  shall  be  amazed  for  all  eternity.  For  who  will 
not  be  astonished  if  he  look  thoughtfully  at  this  Child  and  ask  Him, 
Who  art  thou,  O Babe  of  Bethlehem  ? and  hear  Him  answer ; learn 
of  Isaiah, — “ Unto  us  a child  is  bom,  unto  us  a Son  is  given,  and  the 
government  shall  be  upon  His  shoulder,  and  His  name  shall  be 
called  Wonderful,  Counsellor,  the  Mighty  God,  the  everlasting  Father, 
the  Prince  of  Peace.  Isaiah  ix.  6. 

“ O God,  we  have  thought  of  thy  loving  kindness  in  the  midst 
of  Thy  temple.  For  this  God  is  our  God  for  ever  and  ever,  He 
will  be  our  guide  unto  death.  Ps.  xlviii 

Let  Solomon,  the  wisest  of  kings,  teach  who  this  is; — “The  Lord 
possessed  me  in  the  beginning  of  His  way,  before  His  works  of  old. 

. . . When  He  prepared  the  heavens  I was  there : when  He  set 
a compass  upon  the  face  of  the  depth  . . . Then  I was  by  him, 
as  one  brought  up  with  him.  Prov.  viil  22. 

And  let  the  Sybil  of  the  Gentiles  tell  us  in  Virgil’s  Fourth  Ertegun 


“ The  last  great  age,  foretold  by  sacred  rhymes, 

Renewed  its  finished  coarse,  Satarnian  times 
Roll  round  again ; and  mighty  years  begun 
From  their  first  orb,  in  radiant  circles  run. 

The  base  degenerate  iron  offspring  ends ; 

A golden  progeny  from  heaven  descends." 

— Dry  den's  “ Pastoral 


With  reason,  then,  does  S.  Augustine  exclaim,  “ O miracles  1 O 
prodigies ! O mysteries  1 Brethren,  the  laws  of  nature  are  changed, 
God  is  bora  as  a Man,  a virgin  is  pregnant  . . . God  who  is  and 
was  the  Creator  becomes  a creature,  He  who  is  unmeasured  is  held, 
He  who  makes  men  rich  is  made  poor,  the  Incorporeal  is  clothed 
with  flesh,  the  Invisible  is  seen.  . . . What  was  it  that  so  great  a 
God  did,  lying  in  so  small  a covering  of  flesh  in  the  crib?  Let  us 
hear  Him  as  He  teaches  us  from  His  Manger-Throne, — teaching  not 
by  word  but  by  example."  I,  who  with  three  of  my  fingers  poise  the

of  thee  alone,  O man,  to  deliver  thee  from  thy  sin  and  from  the 
eternal  flames  of  hell,  and  to  bring  thee  to  the  happiness  of  heaven, 
have  come  “ leaping  upon  the  mountains,  bounding  over  the  hills ; ” 
— from  heaven  have  I leapt  down  upon  earth,  from  the  bosom  of 
the  Father  to  the  Virgin’s  womb.  Through  the  bowels  of  My  com- 
passion have  I “ the  Dayspring  from  on  high  ” visited  thee ; I have 
joined  in  one  person  the  Word  with  flesh,  a spirit  with  the  slime  of 
earth,  God  with  man,  and  most  intimate  have  I made  the  union.  I 
have  become  a little  child,  thy  bone  and  thy  flesh,  I am  made  man 
to  make  thee  God.  Within  the  manger,  the  food,  as  it  were  of  the 
ox  and  the  ass,  I lie  among  the  beasts,  because  thou  wast  living 
like  unto  the  beasts, — wallowing  in  flesh  and  blood.  Thou  hadst 
become  as  the  horse  and  the  mule  that  have  no  understanding. 
For  man  when  he  was  in  honour  did  not  understand,  and  was  com- 
parable to  the  senseless  brutes  and  became  like  unto  them.  There- 
fore did  I take  flesh  upon  Me,  that  thou  mayest  eat  My  flesh,  that 
joining  it  to  thy  flesh  thou  mayest  breathe  the  breath  of  Heavenly 
and  Divine  Life.” 

I am  the  Way,  the  Truth,  and  the  Life.  If,  then,  thou  wouldst 
not  err,  follow  Me  as  the  way  to  heaven ; hearken  unto  Me  as  the 
Truth;  embrace  Me  as  the  true  Life.  Vain  is  wealth,  vain  are 
pleasures,  vain  the  honours  of  this  world,  which  foolish  mortals, 
like  silly  children,  follow  after  and  covet  so  greedily.  True  riches, 
true  pleasures,  undying  honours  are  in  heaven ; — these  doth  God 
enjoy,  and  His  angels  and  His  saints ; — aspire  after  these.  Am  I, 
Christ,  the  King  of  kings,  bom  poor  and  needy,  and  dost  thou,  O 
Christian,  seek  after  comforts  and  riches  ? Have  I,  the  uncreated 
and  illimitable  Wisdom,  chosen  for  Myself  the  pains  of  flesh  and  of 
spirit,  and  wilt  thou  indulge  in  the  delights  both  of  the  one  and  of 
the  other?  I,  whom  the  heavens  cannot  contain,  am  shut  up  in  a 
tiny  body  and  in  this  paltry  manger,  and  art  thou,  Christian, 
ashamed  to  be  despised  as  a little  one  and  lowly  ? Not  in  Herod’s 
palace  would  I be  bom,  not  in  the  palace  of  Augustus,  but  in  a 
cavern,  in  a manger ; I chose  to  dwell  in  humble  cottages,  and  pre- 
ferred the  sheepfold  before  the  royal  court,  but  thou  dost  follow

after  courts  and  the  things  of  courts.  Sons  of  men,  why  delight  ye 
in  vanity,  and  why  seek  ye  after  a lie  ? 

“The  stable  cries  aloud  * — says  S.  Bernard,  sermon  5,  “On  the 
Nativity  " — “the  manger  cries  aloud,  His  tears  and  His  clothes. 
The  stable  cries  out  that  it  is  ready  to  be  the  shelter  and  hospital 
of  man  who  has  fallen  among  thieves;  the  manger,  that  food  is 
ready  for  man  that  is  become  like  to  the  beasts ; His  tears  and  His 
clothes  that  with  them  man’s  bleeding  wounds  are  now  washed  and 
wiped  dry.” 

Because  there  was  no  room  for  them  in  the  inn — namely,  for  Mary 
and  Joseph.  The  reading  “for  Him,”  adopted  by  some,  is,  there- 
fore, incorrect  Barradius,  who  is  among  these,  gives  as  a reason 
why  the  Blessed  Virgin  brought  forth  in  the  cave,  and  why  Christ 
was  laid  to  rest  in  a manger  and  not  in  a bed,  that  all  the  places  in 
the  inn  had  already  been  taken  by  the  crowd  of  richer  people  who 
were  flocking  thither  for  the  census.  It  is  very  likely  that  in  a 
small  town  like  Bethlehem  there  was  only  one  inn  ; as  S.  Luke  here 
implies.  But  this  came  to  pass  by  the  supreme  foreknowledge  and 
providence  of  Christ,  that  he  might  give  us  an  example  of  the 
greatest  humility  and  poverty.  Hiding  Himself  away,  however,  He 
was  made  manifest  and  glorified  by  God,  through  the  star  that 
summoned  the  wise  men,  the  angels  sent  to  the  shepherds,  the  over- 
turning of  idols,  and  other  miracles  which  Orosius,  bk.  vL  ch.  20, 
and  Baronius  in  his  annals,  vol  1,  recount 

And  there  were  in  the  same  country  shepherds  abiding  in  the  field \ 
keeping  watch  over  their  flock  by  night  In  the  fields  and  plains  about 
Bethlehem.  St  Jerome,  Ep.  27,  Brochardus,  and  others  say  that 
it  was  the  same  place  where  Jacob  fed  his  flocks,  and  which  was 
called  the  Tower  of  Edar,  or  the  flock,  because  it  is  rich  in 
pasturage;  Gen.  xxxv.  21.  Here,  then,  it  was  that  the  angels  sang 
“ Glory  to  God  in  the  highest ; ” and  S.  Helena  built  on  the  spot  a 
Church  in  honour  of  the  Holy  Angels.  The  place  is  about  a mile 
from  Bethlehem. 

Abiding  in  the  field.  In  Greek  dy£au\ov>ne — passing  the  night

and  ay£ oc  is  a field . Theophylact  interprets  singing  in  the  fields 
as  though  from  auXi/V,  to  sing. 

From  these  words  Joseph  Scaliger  argues  that  Christ  was  born  in 
September ; for  it  is  then,  he  says,  and  not  in  December,  the  depth 
of  winter,  when  everything  is  stiff  with  frost  or  snow,  that  sheep  are 
herded  and  fed  in  the  fields.  However,  that  Christ  was  born  on 
the  25th  of  December  is  the  common  tradition  of  the  Church  and  of 
all  ages.  In  answer  to  Scaliger*s  argument,  it  may  be  urged  that  in 
warm  climates,  such  as  Palestine,  flocks  stay  in  the  fields  even  in 
winter ; whether  in  the  open  air,  or  in  sheds  prepared  for  the  purpose, 
such  as  there  doubtless  would  have  been  in  “the  Tower  of  Edar.” 
So  in  Italy  one  sees  sheep  and  cattle  feeding  on  the  plains  the 
whole  winter. 

Keeping  watch  over  their  flocks  by  night.  In  the  Greek  faldeewm 
4>uXaxac — keeping  watch  through  the  four  watches  of  the  night 
to  guard  their  flocks  lest  they  might  be  pillaged  by  wolves  or 
robbers.  Hence  we  gather  that  Christ  was  bom  in  the  night, 
probably  after  midnight,  when  the  25th  day  of  December  was 
beginning.  And  this  is  signified  mystically  (for  there  is  another 
and  literal  interpretation  of  the  passage)  by  the  words  of  Wisdom 
xviiL  14: — “For  while  all  things  were  in  quiet  silence,  and  that 
night  was  in  the  midst  of  her  swift  course,  Thine  Almighty  Word 
leaped  down  from  heaven  out  of  Thy  royal  throne,  as  a fierce 
man  of  war  into  the  midst  of  a land  of  destruction.” 

In  memory  of  the  event  the  Church  of  the  Three  Shepherds  was 
afterwards  built  on  this  spot  Lucius  Dexter  in  his  Chronicle, 
which  he  dedicates  to  S.  Jerome,  says,  “A.U.C  752,  in  the  consulship 
of  Lentulus  and  Messala,  one  year  before  the  consulship  of  Augustus 
and  Sylvanus,  Christ  is  bom,  and  is  pointed  out  to  three  shepherds 
who  were  holy  men.”  See  Baronius,  AG  1. 

Ver.  9. — And,  lo,  the  angel  of  the  Lord  came  upon  them,  and  the 
glory  of  the  Lord  shone  round  about  them,  and  they  were  sore  afraid. 
“An  angel,”  says  Titus,  “in  a body  which  he  had  assumed  to  signify 
that  God  had  assumed  a body,  and  had  made  Himself  visible  to 
man  by  means  of  the  flesh  He  had  taken  upon  Him.”

AN  ANGEL  APPEARS  TO  THE  SHEPHERDS. 


93 


The  author  of  the  work  “De  Nadyitate  Dii,”  attributed  to  S. 
Cyprian,  Toletus,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others  think  that  this  angel 
was  Gabriel,  for  it  was  he  who  appeared  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  and 
to  Zachariah,  and  he  was  the  agent  in  all  this  matter  of  the  Incar- 
nation. 

Came  upon  them.  In  the  Greek  twnj  which  some 

translate  “ stood  over  them,”  like  an  angel  coming  down  from 
heaven.  These  shepherds,  being  Jews  and  believers,  are  called  by 
an  angel,  for  angels  often  appeared  to  the  Jews ; the  Magi,  being 
Gentiles  and  astrologers,  are  called  by  a star.  See  S.  Gregory, 
Horn,  io,  on  the  Gospels.  Euthymius  gives  four  reasons  why  the 
angel  appeared  first  to  the  shepherds,  and  not  to  Scribes  or  rich 
citizens.  The  first  is  that  here  at  Christ’s  crib,  all  things  breathe 
poverty  and  lowliness,  and  the  simple  shepherds,  poor  and  humble 
as  they  are,  are  more  pleasing  to  God  than  proud  rich  men,  and 
incredulous  Scribes  and  Pharisees — “ I thank  Thee,  O Father,  Lord 
of  heaven  and  earth,  because  Thou  hast  hidden  these  things  from  the 
wise  and  prudent,  and  revealed  them  unto  babes.  Even  so,  Father : 
for  so  it  seemed  good  in  Thy  sight,”  Matt  xl  25.  Theophylact 
remarks  on  this  passage:  “ He  has  overcome  the  learned  by  the 
unlearned,  the  rich  by  the  poor ; and  by  fishermen  He  caught  the 
whole  world  like  fish.” 

The  second  reason  is  that  the  shepherds  were  following  the  old 
way  of  life  of  the  Patriarchs,  the  most  innocent  of  industries.  Abel, 
Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  Joseph,  and  Moses  were  shepherds,  and  to 
them,  as  being  holy  and  innocent,  God  often  appeared  by  His 
angels.  The  third  is  that  Christ  was  to  be  the  shepherd  of  His 
people — “ I am  the  Good  Shepherd  ” (John  x.)  Hence  it  was  once 
usual  to  paint  Christ  as  a Shepherd  surrounded  by  sheep,  as  we  may 
still  see  in  Rome  in  S.  Cosmas  and  S.  Damian  and  other  ancient 
churches. 

And  the  fourth  is,  in  order  that  we  may  understand  that  to  the 
shepherds  of  rational  sheep— of  the  faithful — the  Divine  mysteries 
are  first  revealed  by  God,  for  them  to  teach  their  sheep — to  the  people 
committed  to  their  care,

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


The  author  of  " De  Mirabilibus  Sacrae  Scripture,*  quoted  in  the 
works  of  S.  Augustine  (vol  iii.  bk.  iii.  ch.  2),  gives  a fifth  reason, 
namely,  that  Christ  was  the  Lamb  that  was  to  be  offered  for  the 
salvation  of  the  world.  It  was  fitting,  then,  that  He  should  first  be 
made  kwnon  to  shepherds. 

Tropologically,  Christ  reveals  and  communicates  Himself  to  those 
who  watch  over  their  thoughts  and  actions  as  the  shepherds 
watched  their  flocks,  and  consoles  those  who  have  no  consolation 
for  themselves.  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  5,  " On  the  Nativity  ”)  says,  " The 
infancy  of  Christ  has  no  consolation  for  them  that  speak  much,  nor 
His  tears  for  them  that  laugh,  nor  his  swaddling  clothes  for  them 
that  are  clothed  in  fine  raiment,  nor  His  manger  and  His  stable  for 
those  who  love  the  chief  seats  in  the  assemblies.  But  we  shall  see 
that  these  things  yield,  perhaps,  all  their  consolation  to  those  who 
wait  for  their  Lord  in  calmness  and  quietness.  And  let  them  know 
that  the  angels  themselves  bring  no  consolation  for  other  than 
such  as  these.* 

And  the  glory  of  the  Lord  shone  round  about  them.  In  the  Arabic 
version,  “ the  glory  of  the  Lord  arose  upon  them.*  Everywhere  in 
Holy  Scripture  God  has  manifested  His  glory  by  a heavenly  light 
“ By  glory  of  the  Lord?  says  Euthymius,  “ we  are  to  understand 
Divine  light*  This  brightness,  then,  was  not  that  of  the  stars,  but 
a far  more  august  effulgence,  the  indication  of  the  Majesty  of  God, 
whose  ambassador  the  angel  was.  However,  S.  Ambrose,  Serm.  10, 
" On  the  Feast  of  the  Nativity,”  says,  “ When  the  Saviour  arises,  not 
only  is  the  salvation  of  the  human  race  renewed,  but  also  the  bright- 
ness of  the  sun  himself ; as  the  Apostle  says  in  Ephes.  L — That  by 
Him  He  might  restore  all  things  that  are,  whether  in  the  heavens  or 
on  earth.  For  if  the  sun  is  darkened  when  Christ  suffers,  it  must  of 

necessity  shine  more  brightly  than  usual  when  He  is  born 

To  sum  up,  I hold  that  it  came  to  pass  that  the  night  began  to  wane 
while  the  sun,  hastening  to  pay  his  homage  to  the  birth  of  the  Lord, 
brought  forth  his  light  upon  the  world  before  the  night  fulfilled  her 
course.  Indeed  I call  it  not  night  at  all,  nor  will  I say  that  it  had 
any  darkness  when  the  shepherds  watched,  the  angels  rejoiced,  and

the  stars  paid  their  service.  If  the  sun  stood  still  at  the  prayer  of 
Joshua  the  son  of  Nun,  why  should  it  not  at  the  birth  of  Christ 
make  haste  to  advance  into  the  night?” 

And  they  were  sore  afraid  They  were  filled  with  a holy  and 
reverent  fear,  by  reason  both  of  the  strangeness  of  the  vision  and 
the  brightness,  and  also  of  the  majesty  of  the  heavenly  messenger, 
— a majesty  which  so  strikes  men  as  almost  to  stupefy  them, 
so  that  of  old  the  opinion  prevailed  that  he  who  had  seen  an 
angel  must  die,  according  to  the  words  of  Manoah,  the  father 
of  Samson,  “ We  shall  surely  die  because  we  have  seen  God.”  Judg. 
xiii.  22.  From  this  we  may  learn  that  the  sign  of  a good  angel  is 
that  he  first  terrifies  us  and  then  consoles  us. 

Ver.  io. — And  the  angel  said  unto  them;  Fear  not , for , behold,  2 
bring  you  good  tidings  of  great  fey , that  shall  be  to  all  people — but  first 
to  you,  whom  first  I summon  to  visit  and  adore  the  Messiah  that 
is  born. 

Ver.  1 1. — For  unto  you  is  bom  this  day  in  the  city  of  David  a 
Saviour,  which  is  Christ  the  Lord, . In  Bethlehem,  of  the  seed  and 
lineage  of  David.  Each  word  here  has  its  weight,  and  suggests  new 
matter  for  joy,  as  is  clear  to  every  one  who  ponders  them  deeply. 
Toletus  makes  a full  and  minute  examination  of  the  passage.  The 
name  “Christ”  denotes  priesthood  and  kinghood,  says  Eusebius 
in  the  Catena,  for  both  kings  and  priests  were  anointed,  and  were 
therefore  called  “Christi” — that  is  “consecrated  by  anointing.” 

Ver.  12. — And  this  shall  be  the  sign  unto  you  (by  which  you  may 
know  this  child  from  others  recently  bom),  ye  shall  find  the  babe 
wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes  lying  in  a manger.  For  other  chil- 
dren bom  at  that  time  were  in  houses  and  in  beds,— only  Christ 
was  in  a manger  in  a stable.  Hence  it  appears  that  this  manger 
was  commonly  known  to  every  one,  unless  we  suppose,  as  Toletus 
would  have  it,  that  the  angel  pointed  out  to  the  shepherds  with  his 
finger,  or  by  an  inward  inspiration,  the  cave  where  the  manger  was. 
The  angel  gives  this  sign  that  the  shepherds  may  not  suppose, 
according  to  the  Jewish  notion^  that  their  Messiah,  as  King  of  the 
Jews,  was  to  be  sought  in  the  royal  palace  of  Herod  or  in  any

place  of  the  same  kind.  For  this  was  Christ’s  first  Advent — the 
Advent  of  Humility,  as  His  second  Advent,  to  judge  the  world, 
will  be  one  of  Majesty.  The  sign,  then,  of  the  Word  Incarnate 
and  straitened  is  the  lowliness  of  the  swaddling  bands  and  the 
manger.  As  S.  Bernard  says,  Serm.  i,  “On  the  Nativity,”  “What 
more  unworthy,  what  more  detestable,  what  more  severely  punish- 
able than  that,  seeing  the  God  of  Heaven  become  a little  child, 
man  should  of  his  own  free  will  set  himself  in  opposition  to  magnify 
himself  upon  the  earth?  It  is  a trait  of  intolerable  insolence  that, 
where  His  Majesty  has  effaced  Itself,  a poor  worm  should  be  puffed 
up  and  swollen  with  pride.” 

Ver.  13. — And  suddenly  there  was  with  the  angel  a multitude  of 
the  heavenly  host \ praising  God  and  saying.  Because,  as  I said  at 
verse  7,  all  the  angels  accompanied  Christ  to  earth  and  adored 
Him,  and  they  are  His  battle  array  and  His  host, — the  army  of 
Heaven  that  fight  strongly  for  God  against  the  evil  spirits  and 
against  the  ungodly.  Wherefore  He  is  called  the  “God  of 
Sabaoth ,”  that  is,  of  armies.  So  it  was  that  Jacob,  the  type  of 
Christ,  fleeing  from  his  brother  Esau,  saw  an  army  of  angels  that 
brought  him  aid ; wherefore  he  said,  “ This  is  the  camp  of  God,” 
and  called  the  place  Afahanaim — “The  camp  in  double,”  on 
account  of  the  two  ranks  or  bodies  of  angels  which  he  saw  coming 
to  protect  him,  Gen.  xxxii.  Again,  if  the  stars  of  the  morning 
praised  God,  and  all  the  sons  of  God  (that  is,  the  angels)  rejoiced 
at  the  creation  of  the  world,  as  Job  says  (ch.  xxxviiL  7),  how  much 
more  did  they  do  so  at  the  Incarnation  and  Nativity  of  the  Word  ? 

Ver.  14. — Glory  to  God  in  the  Highest , and  on  earth  peace>  goodwill 
toward  men  (of  good  will  “bonae  voluntatis,”  Vulgate).  So  the 
Syriac,  Egyptian,  Coptic,  and  Persian  versions  also  have  it,  except 
the  words  “ of  good  will,”  of  which  we  will  treat  presently.  “ In  the 
Highest  ” may  be  taken  with  reference  both  to  “ God  ” — glory  to  God 
who  dwells  in  the  highest  heavens ; and  also,  and  preferably  with 
reference  to  “glory.”  In  the  highest  heavens  the  angels  give  glory 
to  God,  as  on  earth  men  enjoy  peace  through  Christ  who  is  now  bom. 
Again,  these  words  may  be  taken  either  in  an  affirmative  sense —

GLORY  TO  GOD  IN  THE  HIGHEST.

supplying  “is;”  or  in  an  optative  sense — supplying  “be”  In  the 
former  sense  it  is,  Now  is  there  glory  to  God  in  heaven,  and  peace  on 
earth.  - For  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  glorify  the  mercy,  the  wisdom, 
and  the  fidelity  of  God,  in  that  He  has  now  exhibited  to  the  world  the 
Christ  promised  by  Him  to  the  patriarchs,  and  hence  there  is  peace 
on  earth,  for  that  Christ  is  bom  to  reconcile  to  God,  as  the  peace- 
making King,  men  who  are  bora  sons  of  wrath.  So  Toletus  and 
Maldonatus.  In  the  optative  sense,  praised  and  glorified  be  God 
in  heaven,  and  let  all  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  bless  and  glorify 
Him,  because  He  has  deigned  to  send  Christ  upon  the  earth,  that 
He,  being  incarnate,  may  bring  to  men  peace — that  is,  reconciliation, 
grace,  salvation,  and  all  good  things.  Therefore  let  heaven  and 
earth  praise  God,  and  let  all  the  dwellers  therein  rejoice  before 
Him,  because  Christ  is  born,  who  is  the  glory  of  God,  the  joy  of 
angels,  the  peace  of  men.  So  Jansenius,  Baradius,  and  others. 

The  Greek  versions  make  this  hymn  consist  of  three  members : — 
(i)  Glory  to  God  in  the  Highest,  (a)  on  earth  peace,  (3)  good  will 
among  men.  So,  too,  the  Syriac,  and  the  Arabic,  which  instead  of 
“ good  will”  has  M rejoicing ” [hilaritas] ; and  the  Greek  fathers 
everywhere  adopt  this  reading — S.  Athanasius,  Basil,  Gregory  of 
Nyssa,  &c. 

But  all  the  Latins,  and,  among  the  Greeks,  Origen,  S.  Chrysos- 
tom, and  Cyril,  read,  and  with  better  reason,  for  tvboxla — good  will \ 
tvfoxiac — of  good  will \ making  the  hymn  consist  of  two  members. 
For  as  glory  is  given  to  God  as  to  Him  who  is  glorified,  so  peace 
is  given  to  men  of  good  will  as  to  those  whom  the  peace  of  Christ 
belongs  and  befits ; and  in  this  way  the  concatenation  of  the  whole 
sentence  hangs  better  together.  The  peace  on  earth  cannot  be 
supposed  to  be  other  than  that  which  belongs  to  men  of  good  will. 
S.  Bernard,  in  his  Epist.  126  to  the  Bishop  of  Aquitania,  says: 
“ How  then  shall  the  peace  of  men  stand  before  God,  or  with  God, 
if  His  glory  cannot  be  secured  to  God  among  men?  O foolish 
sons  of  Adam,  who,  despising  peace,  and  seeking  after  glory,  lose 
both  peace  and  glory  1 ” 

And  on  earth  peace . The  peace  of  men  with  God,  to  whom

Christ  has  reconciled  us ; and,  following  on  this,  peace — that  is,  tran- 
quillity of  mind ; and  in  the  third  place,  peace  and  concord  with 
other  men.  Moreover,  peace  meant  for  the  Jews  every  good — all 
prosperity  and  happiness.  Some  say  that  this  peace  is  Christ 
Himself,  “For  He  is  our  peace,  who  hath  made  both  one,” 
Eph.  ii.  14;  for  “it  pleased  God  through  Him  to  reconcile  all 
things  to  Himself,  bringing  into  peace  all  things,  whether  they  be  in 
heaven  or  on  earth,  by  the  blood  of  His  Cross,”  Colos.  L 20  (Vulg.), 
S.  Augustine  {Or at.  contra  Judceos,  Paganos,  et  Artanos , ax.),  says: 
“ Within  the  Virgin’s  womb  there  were  celebrated  spiritual  nuptials, 
God  was  joined  to  the  flesh,  and  the  flesh  clave  unto  God,  coming 
forth  from  hence  like  a bridegroom  from  his  chamber,  at  whose 
wedding  all  creation  was  stirred  up  and  seemed  to  exult  For  the 
choir  of  angels  proclaim,  as  the  result  of  these  nuptials,  peace  to 
men  of  good  will;  for  He  that  was  the  Son  of  God  became  the 
Son  of  Man.” 

Good  will . These  words  may  be  taken  in  three  ways — First, 
with  reference  to,  and  as  qualifying,  “ men”  Peace  be  to  men,  and 
yet  not  to  all  men,  but  to  those  that  are  of  good  will  So  S. 
Ambrose  reads.  Secondly,  S.  Leo  {Serm.  on  the  Nativity) : “Peace 
be  to  men,  to  make  them  of  good  will , that  they  may  in  all  things 
subject  and  conform  their  will  to  God's  will  and  law.” 

But,  as  the  Greek  is  ifrfo x/a,  which  corresponds  to  the  Hebrew 
P2H,  raison,  and  is  generally  attributed  in  Holy  Scripture  not  to 
man  but  to  God  Himself,  signifying  the  grace,  benevolence,  satis- 
faction, and  love  of  God  towards  men,  Gregory  of  Nyssa,  Theo- 
phylact,  and  Euthymius  give  the  following  interpretation  : Peace  be 
to  men,  whom  God  deigned  to  pursue  with  this  grace  and  display 
of  good  will — with  His  benevolence  and  love,  freely  and  without 
their  merit ; to  give  them  such  a Saviour  and  Reconciler  to  make 
peace  between  Himself  and  them.  So,  in  Ps.  v.,  it  is  said,  “ With 
the  buckler  of  Thy  good  will”  (in  Greek  fufox/a#)  “hast  Thou 
crowned  us  ” (Vulg.) — that  is,  surrounded  us,  as  with  a crown,  with  a 
buckler,  which  is  Thy  benevolence.  And  in  S.  Matt,  xvil,  “ This  is 
My  beloved  Son,  in  whom  I am  well  pleased” — in  the  Greek

tivMxrjffa.  So,  too,  “ men  of  good  will  ” are  elsewhere  called  “ the 
sons  of  love.”  See  Eph.  i.  9. 

Ver.  15. — And  it  came  to  pass,  as  the  angels  were  gone  away  from 
them  into  heaven , the  shepherds  said  one  to  another , Let  us  now  go 
even  unto  Bethlehem,  and  see  this  thing  which  is  come  to  pass . 
This  thing \ a metonomy,  common  in  Scripture,  by  which  the 
word  is  put  for  the  thing  signified  by  it,  as  in  ch.  L 37,  “No 
word ” — that  is,  nothing  “shall  be  impossible  with  God.”  And 
in  2 Kings  i.  4,  “ What  is  the  word  that  is  come  to  pass  ? ” 

Which  the  Lord  hath  made  known  unto  us . In  the  Greek  tywotoi 
— revealed,  made  known  Yea,  and  has  given  us,  rather  than  the 
scribes  and  all  others,  a sign  by  which  we  shall  find  the  Messiah 
that  is  born.  Wherefore,  if  we,  who  have  been  invited  by  Him 
through  an  angel,  do  not  visit  and  adore  Him  who  is  born  for  us, 
and  revealed  first  to  us,  we  shall  be  ungrateful  to  God,  to  the  angels, 
and  to  Christ,  and  enemies  to  ourselves. 

Ver.  16. — And  they  came  with  haste , and found  Mary,  and  Joseph, 
and  the  babe  lying  in  a manger . With  haste,  from  their  longing  and 
zeal  to  see  Christ  Hence  S.  Ambrose  remarks,  “ Thou  seest  that 
the  shepherds  make  haste ; for  no  one  seeks  after  Christ  with  sloth- 
fulness.” And  Bede,  “The  shepherds  hasten,  for  the  presence  of 
Christ  must  not  be  sought  with  sluggishness ; and  many  perchance 
that  seek  Christ  do  not  merit  to  find  Him,  because  they  seek  Him 
slothfully.” 

Ver.  17. — And  when  they  had  seen  it,  they  made  known  abroad  the 
saying  which  was  told  them  concerning  this  child.  They  made  known 
— in  the  Greek  bnywyeav — they  knew  distinctly  and  with  certainty. 
Or  it  may  be  translated,  according  to  Pagninus,  they  made  known  ; 
Theophylact  has,  they  published  abroad \ So,  too,  the  Syriac  version  ; 
and  hence  it  follows  : — 

Ver.  18. — And  all  they  that  heard  it  wondered  at  these  things 
which  were  told  them  by  the  shepherds . The  and  is  not  found  in  the 
Greek,  the  Syriac,  or  the  Arabic  version,  and  with  this  omission  the 
sense  is  plainer.  But,  according  to  the  Roman  version,  the  mean- 
ing is,  they  wondered  at  the  birth  of  the  Messiah,  and  at  the  other

things  that  were  said  about  him  by  the  shepherds,  namely,  that  an 
angel  had  appeared,  that  angels  had  sung  “ Gloria  in  excelsis,”  and 
Christ  was  lying  in  a manger,  &c. 

So  the  Gloss,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others.  Lyranus,  however, 
interprets  the  “and”  as  equivalent  to  “ that  is”  Hence  it  appears 
that  the  shepherds  told  to  many  what  they  had  heard  and  seen 
respecting  the  birth  of  Christ ; and  that  therefore  many  went  to 
the  crib  and  saw  Christ ; but  that  those  only  believed  in  Him  whose 
hearts  God  touched  efficaciously,  while  others,  offended  at  His 
poverty,  despised  Him.  S.  Ambrose  assigns  the  reason  for  this— 
“ The  person  of  the  shepherds  was  not  despicable — assuredly  the 
more  precious  in  the  eyes  of  faith,  the  more  despicable  it  was  to 
worldly  wisdom.  Not  the  schools  crowded  with  their  bands  of  wise 
men  did  the  Lord  seek,  but  a simple  folk,  that  knew  not  how  to 
deck  out  and  colour  the  things  they  had  heard.  For  simplicity  is 
what  is  sought,  ambition  is  not  wanted.” 

Ver.  19. — But  Mary  kept  all  these  things,  and  pondered  them  in  her 
heart — putting  them  together  and  comparing  them — not  as  Bede 
would  have  it,  the  prophecies  made  about  Christ  by  the  prophets, 
but  the  things  seen  and  reported  by  the  shepherds  with  reference 
to  the  angels — the  “Gloria  in  excelsis,”  &c,  with  what  she  had 
experienced  herself — the  annunciation  of  Gabriel,  the  prophecy  of 
Elizabeth  and  of  Zacharias,  and  the  other  things  which  she  herself  had 
witnessed  and  felt  in  herself.  And  this  she  did,  first,  that  seeing  the 
wondrous  harmony — all  things  agreeing  so  well  together — she  might 
be  the  more  confirmed  in  her  faith  that  the  only  begotten  Son  of 
God  was  born  of  her.  So  speaks  S.  Ambrose.  Secondly,  that  by 
the  sweet  contemplation  of  these  circumstances  so  consonant  among 
themselves,  she  might  feed  her  mind,  and  look  with  sure  hope  for 
the  rest — namely,  that  God  would  bring  this  work  to  an  end,  and 
redeem  mankind  by  Christ.  Thirdly,  that  in  good  time  she  might 
unfold  all  these  things  and  narrate  them  in  order  to  the  apostles,  and 
especially  to  S.  Luke,  who  was  destined  to  write  of  them.  Observe 
here  in  the  Virgin  the  rare  example  of  maidenly  silence  and  modesty, 
of  heavenly  prudence,  and  of  the  firmest  faith  and  hope,  as  she

wonders  at  the  present  and  waits  for  the  future.  She  was  com- 
paring the  signs  of  deepest  loneliness  which  she  saw  with  what  she 
knew  of  His  Supreme  Majesty,  the  stable  with  heaven,  the  swaddling- 
clothes  with  that  which  is  spoken  of  in  Ps.  civ.,  " covered  with  light 
as  with  a garment,”  the  crib  with  the  throne  of  God,  the  beasts  with 
the  seraphim. 

Ver.  20. — And  the  shepherds  returned  (to  their  flock,  says  Euthy- 
mius,  for  God  would  have  the  faithful,  however  exalted  by  Him, 
remain  in  the  discharge  of  their  several  callings),  glorifying  and 
praising  God  for  all  the  things  that  they  had  heard  and  seen , as  it 
was  told  unto  them.  Hence  it  is  clear  that  the  shepherds  remained 
constant  in  the  faith  and  gospel  of  Christ — nay,  exulting  and  jubilant 
in  the  joy  of  the  Holy  Spirit  at  having  seen  Him. 

Ver.  21. — And  when  eight  days  were  accomplished  for  the  circum 
cising  of  the  chiid>  His  name  was  called  fesus , which  was  so  named  of 
the  angel  before  He  was  conceived  in  the  womb — when  eight  days  were 
fulfilled — when  the  eighth  day  from  His  nativity  was  come.  That  the 
child  should  be  circumcised — this  indicates  that  He  was  circumcised; 
implying  that  He  underwent  the  rite,  not  of  obligation,  but  freely  and 
of  His  own  will.  For,  in  the  first  place,  He  was  God — the  Author 
of  the  law,  and,  therefore,  not  bound  by  the  law;  and,  in  the 
second  place,  He  was  not  of  the  common  generation  of  men,  who 
are  procreated  of  the  propagation  of  sin  and  conceived  in  iniquity, 
says  Bede,  but  conceived  and  bom  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and,  there- 
fore, without  original  sin,  for  wiping  out  of  which  circumcision 
was  instituted.  For  circumcision  was  the  sign  and  stigma  of 
sin,  the  cautery  with  which  it  was  burnt  out,  and  in  Christ  there 
was  no  sin,  no  lust.  So  in  His  circumcision  Christ  humbled  Him- 
self to  a still  greater  degree  than  in  His  nativity — in  the  latter 
He  took  upon  Him  the  form  of  man,  in  the  former  the  character 
of  a sinner. 

Here  are  seven  reasons  why  Christ  would  of  His  own  accord 
be  circumcised,  drawn  from  the  writings  of  S.  Cyprian,  S.  Augustine, 
Bede,  and  others,  and  given  by  S.  Thomas,  (part  iii.,  quaest.  37, 
art  1) : — First,  to  show  the  reality  of  His  human  flesh,  as  again?!

Manichseus,  who  said  that  He  had  a phantom  body,  Apollinarius, 
who  said  that  the  body  of  Christ  is  consubstantial  with  the  God- 
head, and  Valentinus,  who  said  that  He  brought  His  body  from 
heaven. 

Secondly , to  sanction  the  rite  which  God  had  instituted. 

Thirdly , to  show  that  He  was  of  the  seed  of  Abraham,  who  had 
received  the  ordinance  of  circumcision  as  a sign  of  the  faith  which 
He  had  in  reference  to  Christ. 

Fourthly , to  take  away  all  excuse  from  the  Jews,  lest  they  should 
not  accept  Him  if  He  were  uncircumcised. 

Fifthly , to  commend  to  us  by  His  own  example  the  virtue  of 
obedience.  Hence  it  was  that  He  was  circumcised  on  the  eighth 
day,  as  the  law  prescribed. 

Sixthly , that,  having  come  in  the  likeness  of  the  flesh  of  sin,  He 
might  not  seem  to  reject  the  remedy  by  which  the  flesh  had  been 
wont  to  be  cleansed  of  sin. 

Seventhly , that,  bearing  the  burden  of  the  law  Himself,  He  might 
free  others  from  that  burden,  “ God  sent  forth  His  Son  made  under 
the  law,  to  redeem  them  that  were  under  the  law,”  Gal  iv. 

S.  Leo  (Serm.  2 on  the  Nativity)  adds  as  another  reason  that 
by  this  rite  Christ’s  character  was  hidden  from  the  devil : “ The 
merciful  and  Almighty  Saviour,  so  conducting  the  beginning  of  His 
assumption  of  human  nature  as  to  hide  the  virtue  of  the  Godhead 
inseparable  from  His  humanity  with  the  veil  of  our  infirmity,  eluded 
the  craft  of  the  enemy,  who  was  secure  in  the  supposition  that  the 
birth  of  this  child,  begotten  for  the  salvation  of  mankind,  was  no 
less  liable  to  His  power  than  that  of  all  other  children  who  are 
born” 

S.  Augustine  (Serm.  9 on  the  Nativity)  gives  yet  another  reason 
— that  putting  an  end  to  the  carnal,  Christ  might  put  in  its  place 
that  spiritual  circumcision  which  consists  in  the  mortification  and 
cutting  away  of  vices  and  concupiscence — “ Christ,”  he  says,  " took 
circumcision  upon  Himself  as  about  to  do  away  with  circumcision ; 
He  admitted  the  shadow  as  about  to  give  light — the  figure  as  He 
that  should  fulfil  the  verity.”

Lastly , by  this  act  He  began  that  suffering  by  which  He  became 
the  Redeemer  and  Saviour  of  the  world.  So  it  was  that  in  this  rite 
the  name  of  “ Jesus  ” was  given  Him,  because  He  healed  not  our 
infirmities  with  drugs,  as  the  physicians  do,  but  by  taking  them 
upon  Himself  and  making  satisfaction  for  them  to  God,  so  earning 
the  power  of  healing  all  the  diseases  of  soul  and  of  body,  all  our 
passions,  temptations,  sorrows,  and  afflictions,  whether  in  this  life  or 
in  the  life  to  come.  Art  thou  afflicted,  then,  with  fear  or  over- 
scrupulousness, with  anger  or  bitterness,  with  sorrow  or  poverty? 
Call  upon  Jesus,  and  thou  shalt  feel  that  He  is  thy  Consoler  and 
thy  Saviour. 

Christ  was  circumcised  in  the  cave  where  He  was  born  by  some 
priest  or  Levite,  and  felt  greater  pain  than  other  infants,  in  that  He 
had  the  use  of  reason  which  other  infants  lack,  and  possessed  a 
more  delicate  and  active  sense  of  touch. 

His  name  was  called  Jesus.  The  name  of  Jesus  signifies  the 
function  of  Saviour  in  its  greatest  fulness,  inasmuch  as  He  not 
only  saved  men  Himself,  but  gave  to  His  apostles  and  to  those 
like  them  the  power  of  saving.  This  is  what  is  implied  by  the 
word  Josue , or,  as  the  Hebrews  say,  Jehosua . Let  the  faithful 
then  remember  that  they  are  children  of  Jesus,  and  that  they 
ought  therefore  to  imitate  Him  in  bringing  about  the  salvation  of 
souls. 

Which  was  so  named  of  the  angel  (when  Gabriel  announced  to 
the  Blessed  Virgin  His  conception,  ch.  i.  ver.  31)  before  He  was 
conceived  in  the  womb.  For  Christ  was  conceived  at  the  end  of 
the  Annunciation,  when  the  Blessed  Virgin  answered,  “Behold 
the  handmaid  of  the  Lord,  be  it  unto  me  according  to  Thy 
word.”  In  this  sentence  S.  Luke  gives  us  to  understand  that 
the  name  of  Jesus  had  been  decreed  by  God  for  this  Child 
from  all  eternity,  to  signify  that  He  was  to  be  the  Saviour  of  the 
world. 

Observe  here  how  God  joins  and  couples  in  Christ  the  humble 
with  the  sublime,  the  human  with  the  divine,  the  poison  with  the 
antidote,  to  show  that  in  Him  human  nature  was  joined  to  the

Divine  Majesty.  Christ  would  be  circumcised,  so  taking  on  Him 
the  appearance  of  sin,  but  presently,  when  He  wipes  away  this 
appearance  He  gives  Him  the  name  of  Jesus — the  Saviour  that 
heals  all  sins.  So,  too,  He  would  have  Christ  bom  in  a stable  and 
laid  in  a manger,  as  being  poor  and  abject;  but  soon  He  sum- 
moned by  the  star  the  three  kings,  and  by  the  angel  the  shepherds 
to  adore  Him.  So,  again,  He  would  have  Him  suffer,  be  crucified, 
and  die ; but  at  the  same  time  He  darkened  the  sun  and  the  moon, 
rent  the  rocks  and  shook  the  earth,  that  all  the  elements  might 
testify  of,  and  mourn  for,  the  ignominious  murder  of  their  Creator. 
The  more,  then,  Christ  humbled  Himself,  the  more  the  Father 
exalted  Him.  To  thee,  Christian,  He  will  do  the  same ; wherefore 
fear  not  to  be  humbled,  knowing  for  certain  that  by  this  means 
thou  art  to  be  exalted.  For  the  road  to  glory  is  humiliation, 
according  to  that  promise  of  Christ,  “Every  one  that  humbleth 
himself  shall  be  exalted.” 

Ver.  22. — And  when  the  days  of  her  purification  according  to  the 
law  of  Moses  were  accomplished , they  brought  Him  to  Jerusalem , 
to  present  Him  to  the  Lord . Observe  that  here  three  different 
ordinances  are  intertwined  and  joined  together.  The  first  is  that 
of  Lev.  xii.  2,  et  seq.,  that  a woman,  if  she  have  borne  a male 
child,  shall  remain  unclean  for  forty  days,  and  then  be  purified  in 
the  temple  legally,  that  Is  by  the  sacrificial  rite  prescribed  by  the 
law.  The  second,  that  the  mother  offer  to  God  a lamb,  as  a 
holocaust  for  her  own  purification  (not  that  of  her  child,  as  S. 
Augustine  would  have  it),  and  a young  turtle-dove  or  pigeon  as 
a sin-offering,  if  she  be  rich;  but  if  poor,  only  a pair  of  turtle-doves 
or  two  young  pigeons  (Lev.  xii.  6,  7).  And  the  third,  that  if  the 
offspring  be  a male,  and  the  firstborn,  it  be  set  before  God,  and 
offered  to  Him  as  His  due,  and  holy,  that  is,  consecrated  on 
account  of  the  immunity  of  the  firstborn  of  the  Hebrews  granted 
them  by  God,  when  the  firstborn  of  Pharaoh  and  the  Egyptians 
were  smitten  by  the  angel  in  the  time  of  Moses  (Exod.  xiil  1). 
The  child,  however,  so  offered  might  be  redeemed  by  his  parents 
for  five  shekels  (Num.  iii.  47).  Symbolically,  these  five  shekels

stood  for  the  five  wounds  of  Christ,  with  which,  as  with  a price, 
He  redeems  the  human  race. 

The  days  of  her  purification*  In  the  old  law  the  woman  bearing 
a child  was  unclean,  with  a natural,  a legal,  and  a moral  unclean- 
ness ; but  especially  because  she  bore  a child  whom  she  conceived 
in  original  sin.  The  natural  undeanness  was  that  physically 
incidental  to  her  gestation  and  delivery ; and  the  legal  defilement 
was  consequent  upon  this,  for  the  law,  on  account  of  these 
impurities,  regarded  her  as  impure,  and  directed  that  she  be  kept 
away  from  the  temple,  and  be  held,  as  it  were,  “ undean  ” for 
forty  days,  until,  on  the  fortieth  day,  she  was  purified  by  the  pre- 
scribed rite. 

With  reference  to  the  question  whether  the  Blessed  Virgin 
suffered  this  impurity,  S.  Jerome  (Ep.  22  ud  Eustochium\  John 
of  Avila,  commenting  on  Lev.  xii.,  and  Erasmus  on  this  same 
passage,  affirm  that  she  did  All  other  authorities,  however,  agree 
in  the  contrary  view,  since  the  Virgin’s  parturition  was  perfectly 
pure.  See  S.  Augustine  (de  Quinque  hceresibus , ch.  v).  This  point 
has  been  treated  in  what  has  been  said  on  v.  7 of  the  present 
chapter.  Hence  the  Blessed  Virgin  incurred  no  defilement,  and 
therefore  was  not  bound  by  the  law  of  purification.  Yet,  in  her 
zeal  for  humility,  in  order  to  make  herself  like  other  women  who 
bear  children,  that  she  might  not  give  scandal  in  seeming  to  be 
singular,  and  that  she  might  conceal  her  virginity  and  her  concep- 
tion by  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  willing  to  be  purified, 
even  as  Christ,  for  similar  reasons,  was  willing  to  be  circumcised. 
Hence  S.  Bernard  ( Serm . 3 on  the  Purification)  says : “ In  this  con- 
ception, and  in  this  child-birth,  there  was  nothing  impure,  nothing 
sinful,  nothing  that  had  to  be  purged,  for  this  offspring  is  the  fount 
of  purity,  and  is  come  to  make  a cleansing  of  sins.  What  is  there 
in  me  for  a legal  observance  to  purify — in  me,  who,  by  this  immacu- 
late parturition,  am  become  most  pure  ? Truly,  O Blessed  Virgin, 
thou  hadst  no  need  for  purification  \ but  had  thy  Son  need  of  cir- 
cumcision ? Be  thou  among  women  as  one  of  them,  for  so  too  is 
thy  Son  among  mea”

Tropologically,  the  purification  of  the  soul  is  penance,  and  this 
the  Blessed  Virgin  underwent,  not  for  her  own  sins,  seeing  that 
she  had  none,  but  for  those  of  others,  as  Christ  did.  Still  she  did 
not  undergo  the  Sacrament  of  Penance,  because  she  had  no  sins 
of  her  own  to  confess.  See  S.  Chrysostom,  Tertullian,  S.  Augustine, 
and  S.  Ambrose  in  his  book  “ On  Penance.” 

To  present  Him  to  the  Lord.  The  Syriac  version  has  "in  the 
presence  of  the  Lord”  The  Blessed  Virgin,  holding  Christ  in  her 
hands,  on  bended  knee,  offered  Him  to  God  with  the  greatest 
reverence  and  devotion,  saying,  “Behold,  O Eternal  Father, 
this  is  Thy  Son  whom  Thou  hast  wished  to  take  flesh  from  me 
for  the  salvation  of  men.  To  Thee  I render  Him,  and  to  Thee 
I offer  Him  entirely,  that  Thou  mayest  do  with  Him  and  with 
me  as  it  shall  please  Thee,  and  by  Him  mayest  redeem  the  world.” 
So  saying,  she  presented  Him  to  the  priest  as  to  the  representative 
of  God ; and  then  she  redeemed  Him  with  five  shekels,  as  the  law 
prescribed. 

Ver.  23. — As  it  is  written  in  the  law  of  the  Lord,  Every  male  that 
openeth  the  womb  shall  be  called  holy  to  the  Lord  (Exod.  xiii.  12) — 
that  is,  shall  be  offered  and  consecrated  to  God  as  a thing  dedicated 
and  holy.  Christ  was  not  bound  by  this  law,  both  because  He 
subsisted  in  the  Person  of  the  Word,  which  is  bound  by  no  laws, 
and  also  because  He  did  not  open  His  mother's  womb,  but  came 
forth  while  it  remained  closed.  So  Cyril  ( Horn.  De  Occurs . Dom.\ 
Pope  Hormisdas  (Ep.  i.  ch.  iii.),  Bede,  and  others. 

Rupertus,  John  of  Avila,  Jansenius,  and  Maldonatus,  therefore,  who 
take  the  phrase  " that  openeth  the  womb  ” as  merely  equivalent  to 
" first  born ,”  and  suppose,  on  this  ground,  that  Christ  was  included 
by  these  words,  but  otherwise  excepted  from  the  law  as  being  God 
and  the  Son  of  God,  are  incorrect  in  their  view.  Lastly,  I quote 
the  following  from  S.  Bernard’s  “Sermon  on  the  Purification” — 
“Veiy  slight,  brethren,  does  this  oblation  seem,  in  which  He  is 
but  presented  to  the  Lord,  redeemed  with  birds,  and  straightway 
taken  back.  The  time  shall  come  when  He  shall  be  offered  up 
not  in  the  temple,  nor  within  the  arms  of  Simeon,  but  outside  the

city  in  the  arms  of  the  Cross.  The  time  shall  come  when  He  shall 
not  be  redeemed  with  blood  not  his  own,  but  with  His  own  blood 
shall  redeem  others,  because  God  the  Father  hath  sent  him  to  be 
the  redemption  of  His  people.  That  shall  be  an  evening  sacrifice, 
this  is  a morning  sacrifice — this  is  the  more  joyous,  that  shall  be 
the  fuller.” 

Ver.  24. — And  to  offer  a sacrifice  according  to  that  which  is  said  in  the 
law  of  the  Lord,  A pair  of  turtle-doves , or  two  young  pigeons , because 
they  were  poor ; for  the  rich  were  obliged  to  give  in  addition  to  this 
a lamb  for  a holocaust.  Although  the  three  kings  had  offered 
to  Christ  a great  quantity  of  gold,  still  the  Blessed  Virgin,  zealously 
affected  towards  poverty,  accepted  but  little  of  it,  that  she  might 
show  her  contempt  of  all  earthly  things,  and  what  she  took  she 
spent  in  a short  time,  says  John  of  Avila,  on  S.  Matt  ii.  Quest.  47  ; 
or,  if  she  took  much,  say  S.  Bonaventure  and  Dionysius,  she 
distributed  it  among  the  poor.  And,  lastly,  because  she  was  by 
her  condition  poor,  she  would  be  reckoned  among  the  poor,  and 
offer  the  gift  of  the  poor. 

The  purification  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  is  commemorated  by  the 
Church  on  the  second  day  of  February,  in  order,  Baronius  says,  to 
abolish  the  Lupercalia,  which  used  to  be  celebrated  at  Rome  on 
that  day.  The  order  of  the  rite  of  purification  was  as  follows : — 
First,  the  woman  came  into  the  “ court  of  the  unclean  ” — she  being 
unclean  until  her  purification.  Next,  she  offered  a sin-offering  of  a 
turtle-dove  or  a young  pigeon.  It  is  probable  that  she  was  also 
sprinkled  with  water  mixed  with  the  ashes  of  the  red  heifer,  this 
water  being,  as  it  were,  an  “ aqua  lustralis  ” used  in  all  purifications. 

Then  she  offered  the  infant  to  God,  and  redeemed  him.  And, 
lastly,  she  offered  to  God  as  a whole  burnt-offering  of  thanksgiving 
a lamb,  or  else  a turtle-dove,  or  a pair  of  young  pigeons.  These  last 
two  acts  were  performed  by  the  woman  (by  this  time  purified) 
standing  in  the  “ court  of  the  clean ; n there  she  would  offer  the 
infant  at  the  door  of  the  tabernacle ; and  there  watch  from  afar  off 
her  holocaust  being  offered  in  the  “court  of  the  priests” — for 
between  the  court  of  the  priests  and  that  of  the  people  there  was  a

wall  or  a partition  three  feet  high,  so  that  the  people  could,  from 
their  court,  watch  the  offerings,  and  all  that  was  being  done  in  the 
court  of  the  priests. 

Tropologically,  the  turtle-doves  and  the  pigeons  which  the 
woman  used  to  offer  for  her  sin,  ue.y  her  defilement  or  legal 
uncleanness,  signified  the  groaning  or  compunction  of  the  penitent 
by  which  sins  are  expiated,  especially  when  they  accompany  the 
sacrament  of  expiation.  Moreover,  the  Blessed  Virgin,  having  no 
sin,  needed  no  sacrament  to  expiate  it,  but  she  received  the  Sacra- 
ment of  Baptism  as  a profession  of  the  Christian  religion,  that  of  Con- 
firmation, the  Eucharist,  and  perhaps  also  Extreme  Unction.  She 
entered  into  the  state  of  matrimony  with  Joseph,  but  this  was  not 
a sacrament  in  the  old  law.  She  never  confessed  her  sins  or  received 
absolution  from  a priest,  in  that  she  had  no  sins.  It  may  be  said, 
however,  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  had  reason  to  fear  lest  she  had  been 
guilty  of  some  distraction  in  prayer,  some  venial  negligence  in  word 
or  thought,  and  that  she  might  have  confessed  such  as  these,  since,  as 
S.  Gregory  says,  “ It  is  the  characteristic  of  good  souls  to  acknow- 
ledge fault  where  there  is  no  fault.”  And  this  is  true  in  the  case  of 
sinners  and  those  in  the  state  of  original  sin,  but  not  for  those  who 
are  innocent  and  unspotted  as  the  Blessed  Virgin  was.  Wherefore, 
as  the  angels  see  clearly  all  their  own  actions,  and  the  defects — even 
the  most  trifling — in  them,  and  as  Adam,  too,  saw  his  own  actions 
when  he  was  in  the  state  of  innocence — in  accordance  with  the 
perfection  which  belongs  to  this  state — so  the  Blessed  Virgin  in 
like  manner  saw  all  her  own  acts  in  the  past  and  in  the  future,  and 
knew  that  they  were  most  pure  and  most  holy,  and  altogether  without 
any  defect,  even  venial,  and  for  this  reason  she  could  not  confess  them 
as  sins.  She  did  not,  however,  lift  herself  up  on  that  account,  but 
humbled  herself  the  more,  knowing  this  to  be  the  gift  of  God  and 
not  her  own  merit  Hence  the  opinion  of  Sylvester,  in  the  “Golden 
Rose  " (tit  3,  ch.  53),  to  the  effect  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  received 
the  Sacrament  of  Penance  and  was  accustomed  to  confess  venial 
sins  conditionally  to  S.  John,  must  be  flatly  rejected,  especially  as 
absolution  cannot  be  given  on  uncertain  matter,  but  the  penitent,  to

be  capable  of  it,  must  confess  some  particular  sin — Vasquez  (part 
Hi.,  disp.  1 19,  cfc  7). 

Ver.  25. — And,  behold,  there  was  a man  in  Jerusalem,  whose  name 
was  Simeon;  and  the  same  man  was  just  and  devout,  waiting  for  the  con- 
solation of  Israel : and  the  Holy  Ghost  was  upon  him . Calvin  would 
have  it  that  Simeon  was  of  obscure  birth  and  unknown ; but  that  he 
was  venerable  by  his  age  and  his  sanctity  appears  from  what  follows 
here.  Many  hold  that  he  was  a priest,  and  that  it  was  in  this 
capacity  that  he  blessed  Mary  and  Joseph.  So  say  Lyranus, 
Dionysius,  Cajetan,  Francis  Lucas,  Toletus,  S.  Athanasius  (in  " The 
Common  Essence  of  the  Father  and  the  Son  w),  S.  Cyril  ( De  Occursu 
Dom.),  S.  Epiphanius  (“  Treatise  on  the  Fathers  of  the  Old  Testa- 
ment ”),  and  Canisius  (de  Deipara , bk.  iv.  ch.  10).  But  Theophylact, 
Euthymius,  Jansenius,  and  Barradius  are  of  opinion  that  he  was  a 
layman,  and  gave  his  blessing  not  as  a priest  but  as  an  old  man. 

And  the  same  was  just  From  this  Galatinus  (De  Arcanis  Fidei, 
L 1,  cap.  3)  gathers  that  Simeon  was  the  disciple  and  son  of  Hillel, 
who,  a little  before  the  birth  of  Christ,  was  the  founder  of  the  Scribes 
and  Pharisees,  as  S.  Jerome  states  on  Isa.  viii  The  words  of 
Galatinus  are : “ Simeon,  the  son  of  Hillel,  whom  the  Talmudists,  by 
reason  of  his  extraordinary  sanctity,  call  ‘ Saddic  * the  Just  In  whom 
(as  it  is  related  in  the  * Pirke  Avoth  1 or  c the  chapters  of  the  fathers  ’) 
the  rule  of  the  great  Academy  of  the  Synagogue  came  to  an  end. 
He  spoke  many  things  concerning  the  Messiah,  and,  at  length, 
being  in  his  extreme  old  age,  and  having  received  an  answer  from 
the  Holy  Ghost  that  he  should  not  see  death  without  seeing  the 
Messiah,  receiving  Christ  Himself  in  his  arms,  he  confirmed,  in  the 
presence  of  Christ,  the  truth  of  those  things  which  he  had  taught 
about  Him  under  the  inspiration  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  And  his  note- 
worthy sayings  are  to  be  found  scattered  about  in  the  books  of  the 
Talmudists.” 

Genebrardus  (Chronology,  bk.  ii.)  is  of  the  same  opinion,  and 
adds  : “ For  the  belief  that  with  Simeon  the  spirit  of  the  great 
Synagogue — a spirit  less  than  the  prophetic  but  greater  than  the 
common— died  out,  the  Talmudists  are  our  authority  in  the  treatise

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


1 Pirke  Avoth.’  The  Rabbi  Moses,  the  Egyptian,  records  that  he  was 
not  only  the  disciple,  but  also  the  son  of  Hillel,  and  the  teacher,  and 
indeed  the  father,  of  Gamaliel,  at  whose  feet  Paul  learnt  the  law.” 
All  this,  however,  while  it  appears  highly  probable,  is  at  the  same 
time  uncertain.  There  were  many  Simeons  or  Simons  (for  the  two 
names  are  identical)  who  were  just,  as,  for  instance,  Simeon  the  high 
priest,  the  son  of  Oniah,  called  “the  Just,”  and  spoken  of  with 
praise  at  some  length  in  Ecclus.  1.  i.  Besides,  the  successors  and 
disciples  of  Hillel,  the  Scribes  and  Pharisees,  were  in  the  highest 
degree  hostile  to  Christ 

Devout.  In  Greek  i&Xaj&fc — religious,  God-fearing.  Waiting  for 
the  consolation  of  Israel — the  coming  of  the  Messiah,  who  was  to 
console  Israel,  that  is,  the  faithful  people,  and  set  them  free  from 
the  oppression  of  Satan,  of  Herod,  the  Romans,  and  the  Scribes 
and  Pharisees.  For,  eager  for  the  common  weal,  “ he  sought,”  says 
S.  Ambrose,  “ the  good  of  his  people  rather  than  his  own.”  By  the 
transferring  of  the  sceptre  from  Judah  to  Herod,  according  to  the 
prophecy  of  Jacob  (Gen.  xlix.  io),  by  the  completion  of  the  seventy 
weeks  of  Dan.  ix.,  and  by  other  prophecies,  Simeon  knew  that  the 
coming  of  Christ  was  at  hand,  to  deliver  Israel — that  is,  the  faithful 
— from  all  evil,  as  well  from  their  sins  as  from  all  miseries,  partly 
in  this  life,  partly  in  the  life  to  come.  Christ,  then,  is  the  consola- 
tion of  the  faithful,  for  except  in  Him  there  is  no  hope  of  sal- 
vation, but  only  despair  and  desolation.  Hence  Isaiah,  ch.  xL  i, 
promising  the  coming  of  Christ,  says,  “ Comfort  ye,  comfort  ye  my 
people,  saith  your  God  : speak  unto  the  heart  of  Jerusalem.”  And 
in  ch.  li.  3,  “ The  Lord  shall  comfort  Sion ; ” and  again  in  lxl  i, 
“The  Spirit  of  the  Lord  is  upon  me  ...  to  comfort  all  them 
that  mourn.”  And  in  2 Cor.  L 5,  S.  Paul  says,  “As  the  suffer- 
ings of  Christ  abound  in  us,  so  our  consolation  also  aboundeth 
by  Christ.”  In  the  time  of  Christ  the  condition,  as  well  of  the 
Stale  as  of  the  Church  of  Israel,  was  one  of  the  deepest  affliction. 
Their  body  politic,  while  it  lacked  its  own  chiefs,  was  under  the 
yoke  of  Herod  and  the  Pagan  Romans,  and  their  Church,  on  the 
other  hand,  was  under  bondage  to  impious  priests,  to  Scribes  and

THE  HOLINESS  OF  SIMEON. 


Ill 


Pharisees ; and  in  S.  Matt  xxiiL  5,  Christ  tells  us  what  manner  of 
men  these  were — how  they  oppressed  the  people^  and  into  what 
errors  and  vices  they  led  them. 

And  the  Holy  Ghost  was  upon  him,  both  sanctifying  him  and 
conferring  on  him  the  gift  of  prophecy.  Observe  that  in  Holy 
Scripture  the  Holy  Ghost  is  said  to  come  to,  or  be  in,  any  one  not 
only  by  the  grace  which  makes  that  person  acceptable,  but  also  by 
any  grace,  “grafts  data”  />.,  conferred  not  necessarily  in  considera- 
tion of  the  merit  of  the  recipient,  and  not  for  his  own  benefit,  but 
for  that  of  others,  e.g.,  the  grace  of  prophecy,  as  here  in  the  case 
of  Simeon.  So  in  ch.  L 35,  the  Holy  Ghost  is  spoken  of  as  about 
to  come  upon  the  Blessed  Virgin,  that  she  may  conceive  a Son, 
and  become  the  Mother  of  God;  this  is  a grace,  “gratis  data.” 
And  again  in  ver.  41  of  the  same  chapter  Elizabeth  is  spoken  of 
as  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  when  she  began  to  prophecy. 

Upon  him.  In  the  Greek  iV  aun>»,  the  Holy  Ghost,  coming  down 
upon  him,  took  possession  of  his  soul,  so  that  he  seemed  not  so 
much  a man  of  this  earth  as  a celestial  and  divine  being,  and 
this  on  purpose  that  his  testimony  as  to  Christ  might  be  irre- 
fragable and  beyond  dispute. 

Celsus  (Be  Incredulitate  Judaorum  apud  Vigilium) — to  be  found 
among  the  works  of  Cyprian)  gives  a tradition  to  the  effect  that 
Simeon  was  blind,  and  recovered  his  sight  when  he  touched  Christ ; 
but  S.  Luke  would  not  have  been  silent  about  so  great  a miracle, 
and  which  would  so  clearly  have  been  in  place  here. 

Ver.  26. — And  it  was  revealed  unto  him  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  that 
he  should  not  see  death , before  he  had  seen  the  Lord's  Christ.  “It 
was  revealed  ” by  a divine  oracle  and  promise — the  Greek  expres- 
sion is  xgqpar/gw.  “ The  Lords  Christ ” — the  Messiah,  anointed 
with  the  unction  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  plentitude  of  grace. 
(Isa.  xi.  2.) 

In  this  Simeon  was  privileged  far  beyond  Abraham,  Isaac,  and 
all  the  patriarchs  and  prophets,  who,  as  the  apostle  says,  Heb.  xi.  13, 
“died  in  faith,  not  having  received  the  promises,  but  having 
seen  them  afar  off,  and  embraced  them.”  Hence  it  is  plain

S.  LUKE,  C.  IT. 


that  Simeon  was  a man  of  singular  holiness,  and  full  of  holy 
aspirations  and  zeal. 

Ver.  27. — And  he  came  by  the  Spirit  into  the  Temple.  By  the 
impulse  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  moved  and  incited  by  the  Holy  Spirit, 
say  Euthymius  and  Theophylact.  And  the  same  Spirit  who  urged 
him  thither  gave  him  the  sign  by  which  he  should  know  Christ 
among  so  many  infants  that  were  then  being  offered  in  the  Temple, 
or,  rather,  showed  Him  to  him,  inwardly  prompting  him  and 
saying,  Behold,  this  is  Christ,  whom  I promised  thee  that  thou 
shouldst  see  before  thy  death. 

Timothy,  a priest  of  Jerusalem,  in  his  Oratio  de  Simeone , 
thinks  that  he  must  have  seen  the  Virgin  surrounded  with  light  in 
the  midst  of  the  other  women,  and  by  this  mark  understood  her 
to  be  the  Mother  of  the  Messiah.  The  Carthusian  (Denis),  too, 
says,  “ Perhaps  he  saw  some  divine  splendour  in  the  countenance  of 
the  child/’ 

Hence  we  may  learn  how  God  guides  the  mind  and  the  paths  of 
His  saints  that  they  may  fall  in  with  the  good  predestined  for  them 
by  Him.  Wherefore  we  must  pray  diligently,  especially  when  about 
to  undertake  a journey,  for  this  direction,  that  we  may  be  preserved 
from  evil,  and  blessed  with  good  issues ; saying  with  the  Psalmist, 
“ O Lord,  show  me  Thy  ways  and  teach  me  Thy  paths,”  Ps.  xxv.  4 
“ Make  me  to  go  in  the  path  of  Thy  commandments,”  Ps.  cxix.  35. 

We  read,  in  the  life  of  S.  Ephrem,  that,  when  he  was  entering  a 
certain  city,  he  prayed  to  God  that  he  might  fall  in  with  something 
that  should  edify  him.  A harlot  met  him,  and  stared  so  hard  at 
him,  that  he  asked  with  great  severity  why  she  acted  so  immodestly ; 
and  he  received  this  answer,  “ Let  woman  look  upon  man,  for  from 
him  was  she  made,  but  let  man  fix  his  gaze  upon  the  earth,  of 
which  he  was  formed.”  The  man  of  God  felt  that  the  rebuke  was 
just,  and,  being  deeply  touched  by  it,  gave  thanks  to  God  because 
he  had  received  from  a harlot  a lesson  so  salutary. 

And  when  the  parents  brought  in  the  child  Jesus , to  do  for  Him 
after  the  custom  of  the  law.  In  the  Greek  xai  lr  rw  tteayayu* — when 
they  had  brought.  This  sentence  is  dependent  on  the  next  verse.

SONG  OF  SIMEON.  113 

Ver.  28. — Then  took  he  Him  up  in  his  arms , and  blessed  God , and 
said.  Martial  says  of  the  dying  swan — 

“ Sweet  cadences  the  swan  with  Toice  that  fails  in  death 
Uttereth  ; his  own  dirge  shaped  of  his  own  dying  breath.” 

And  so  the  last  utterances  of  the  wise  are  the  sweetest,  their  powers 
maturing  with  years.  Again  Cicero  tells  us  in  the  first  Tusculan 
Disputation,  “Not  without  reason  are  swans  dedicated  to  Apollo, 
since  they  seem  to  have  from  him  a gift  of  prophecy,  by  virtue  of 
which,  foreseeing  the  good  that  there  is  in  death,  they  die  with  joy 
and  in  the  act  of  singing.”  And  Simeon  here  foresees  in  this  way 
the  joy  that  through  Christ  is  to  come  to  him  after  his  death,  which 
must  soon  take  place. 

Ver.  29. — Lord,  now  lettest  thou  Thy  servant  depart  in  peace,  accord - 
ing  to  Thy  word,  Lettest  thou — in  Greek  dvroXvue,  loosen,  as  it  were, 
from  the  prison-chains  of  this  body,  that  I may  go  to  the  liberty, 
peace,  and  rest  which  the  fathers  in  limbo  enjoy.  In  peace,  so 
Tobias,  ch.  iii.  6;  and  Abraham,  Gen.  xv.  15,  desired  to  die  in 
peace.  Euthymius  here  understands  by  peace — 

1.  The  calming  of  his  feelings,  which  had  fluctuated  between  hope 
and  fear  with  reference  to  his  seeing  Christ. 

2.  The  peace  of  an  intrepid  soul  that  did  not  fear  death. 

3.  His  joy. 

4.  Peace  may  be  taken  to  mean  that  security  from  the  dangers  of 
the  world  which  death  brings.  S.  Cyprian  (Tract,  de  Mortalitate, 
c.  L)  says,  “Joyful  at  his  approaching  death,  sure  that  it  must  soon 
come,  he  took  the  Child  in  his  hands,  and,  blessing  the  Lord,  lifted 
up  his  voice  and  said,  Now  Thou  dost  dismiss,  &c.,  . . . thus 
proving  and  bearing  witness  that  then  is  there  peace  for  the  servants 
of  God,  then  an  easy  and  tranquil  mind  when,  delivered  from  out 
the  whirlpools  of  the  world,  we  make  for  the  haven  of  our  eternal 
habitation  and  our  peace.” 

Thy  word.  Thy  promise,  says  Theophylact,  when  Thou  didst 
promise  to  prolong  my  life  until  I should  see  Christ ; now  have  I 
seen  Him,  therefore  let  me  depart  and  die. 

Symbolically,  S.  Augustine  (Serm.  20  de  Tempore)  says,  “Now, 
VOL.  vl  h

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


Lord,  let  me  depart  in  peace,  because  I see  thy  peace — Christ,  Who 
shall  make  peace  between  heaven  and  earth — between  God  and 
angels  and  men — between  men  and  themselves.” 

And  Simeon  obtained  his  wish  from  God,  for  soon  after  he  went 
to  his  rest  S.  Epiphanius  ( De  Prophetarum  vita , c.  xxiv.)  puts 
S.  Simeon  among  the  prophets.  “Simon,”  he  says,  “departed  this 
life  full  of  years  and  utterly  worn  out ; yet  did  he  not  obtain  at  the 
hands  of  the  priests  the  last  honours  of  burial.”  He  gives  no  reason, 
however,  why  this  should  have  been  so,  but  it  is  thought  that,  in 
openly  announcing  the  advent  of  Christ,  he  brought  upon  himself 
the  envy  and  hatred  of  the  other  priests. 

Tropologically,  the  Church  sings  this  hymn  of  Simeon  eveiy 
evening  in  the  Office  of  Compline,  for  two  reasons : — First,  to  ad- 
monish the  faithful,  and  especially  ecclesiastics,  to  think  upon 
death,  and  so  live  as  though  they  were  to  die  in  the  evening ; and, 
again,  that  they  may  acquire  that  yearning  which  Simeon  felt  to  pass 
away  from  the  vanities  and  troubles  of  this  life  to  the  true  and 
blessed  life  in  heaven,  begging  of  God  to  be  permitted  to  depart, 
and  saying  with  Paul,  “I  desire  to  be  dissolved  and  to  be  with 
Christ”  “ Behold  how  the  just  man,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “as  though 
shut  in  within  the  gross  prison-house  of  the  body,  wishes  to  be 
loosed,  that  he  may  begin  to  be  with  Christ  But  he  that  will  be 
set  free,  let  him  come  to  the  Temple,  let  him  come  to  Jerusalem,  let 
him  wait  for  the  Lord,  let  him  embrace  Him  with  good  work  as 
with  the  arms  of  faith.  Then  shall  he  be  set  free,  that  he  may  not 
see  death,  because  he  has  looked  upon  life. 

Ver.  30. — For  mine  eyes  have  seen  thy  salvation.  “ Salvation ,”  in 
Greek  <r«rjj£/or,  the  word  used  by  the  Septuagint  as  a rendering  of 
ihe  Hebrew  iescua , safety.  “Safety”  is  used  by  metonomy 

for  “Saviour.”  By  “salvation,”  then,  we  are  to  understand  the 
Saviour  Christ,  whom  the  ancient  fathers  desired  to  see,  but  Simeon 
alone  saw,  touched,  and  embraced. 

Ver.  31. — Which  Thou  hast  prepared  before  the  face  of  all  people. 
That  all  the  nations  of  the  Gentiles  may  draw  salvation  from  Christ 
the  Saviour.  God  has  not  hidden  Christ  in  a corner  of  Judaea,  but

A LIGHT  FOR  THE  GENTILES.

has  set  Him  forth  before  all  men,  and  soon  will  announce  Him 
throughout  the  world  by  His  Apostles,  that  all  who  will  embrace 
His  faith  and  law  may  be  saved  by  Him. 

Ver.  32. — A light  to  lighten  the  Gentiles , and  the  glory  of  Thy 
people  Israel  Thou  hast  given  Christ  the  Saviour  that  He  may  be 
a light  for  the  enlightenment  of  the  Gentiles,  enlightening  with  His 
faith  and  worship  the  Gentiles  who  know  not  the  true  God,  and 
also  to  be  the  glory  and  honour  of  the  Jewish  people.  The  Arabic  has, 
" the  light  that  hath  appeared  to  the  nations.”  In  the  same  way  we 
have  in  Ps.  cxviiL  18,  “ Open  Thou  ” (that  is,  illumine)  “ mine  eyes.” 
The  allusion  here  is  to  the  prophecy  of  Isaiah,  made  seven  hundred 
years  before,  in  ch.  xlii.  6,  “ I will  give  thee  for  a covenant  of  the 
people,  for  a light  of  the  Gentiles,  to  open  the  blind  eyes,  to  bring 
out  the  prisoners  from  the  prison,  and  them  that  sit  in  darkness 
out  of  the  prison-house ; ” and  in  xlix.  6,  **  I will  also  give  thee  for  a 
light  to  the  Gentiles,  that  thou  mayest  be  my  salvation  unto  the  end 
of  the  earth.”  In  the  Mass,  and  particularly  on  the  Feast  of  the  Puri- 
fication, we  bless  candles,  light  them,  and  carry  them  about,  thereby 

(1)  symbolising  our  belief  in  Christ  as  the  light  of  the  nations ; and 

(2)  praying  that  He  will  grant  us  in  this  life  the  light  of  His  grace, 
and  in  the  other  life  the  light  of  His  gladness  and  His  glory.  And 
it  is  for  this  reason  that  these  lighted  candles  are  put  into  the  hands 
of  the  dying.  See  Amalarius,  Durandus,  and  others,  who  have 
written  on  the  Offices  of  the  Church. 

And  the  glory  of  Thy  people  Israel.  1.  Because  Christ,  promised 
to  their  forefathers  by  God,  took  upon  Himself  the  flesh  of  their 
race,  and  was  a Jew. 

2.  Because  He  lived  and  died  in  Judaea,  His  life  being  made 
glorious  by  His  teaching,  His  holiness,  and  His  miracles. 

3.  Because  He  first  founded  His  Church  in  Judaea,  the  first 
believers  having  been  Jews,  who  afterwards  gathered  the  Gentiles 
to  themselves. 

4.  It  was  in  Judaea  that  He  rose  from  the  dead  and  gloriously 
ascended  into  heaven,  sending  down  thence  the  Holy  Ghost  with 
the  gift  of  tongues.

S.  LUKE,  c.  II. 


The  allusion  is  to  Isaiah  xlvi.  13,  “I  will  place  salvation  in  Zion 
for  Israel,  my  glory;”  and  lx.  1,  “The  glory  of  the  Lord  is  risen 
upon  thee ; ” and  ibid.  2,  “ His  glory  shall  be  seen  upon  thee.” 

Ver.  33. — And  Joseph  and  his  mother  marvelled  at  those  things 
which  were  spoken  of  Him . Joseph,  who  is  called  the  father  of 
Christ,  not  only  because  he  was  His  foster-father,  and  was  com- 
monly supposed  to  be  His  natural  father,  but  also  because  Christ 
had  been  born  to  him  lawfully  in  wedlock,  and  of  his  wife  Mary ; 
and  this  marriage  of  Joseph  with  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  made  and 
ordained  by  God  for  the  sake  of  this  progeny.  So  say  S.  Augustine 
( De  Cons.  Evang.  c.  i),  Bede,  Jansenius,  and  others. 

Marvelled.  For,  though  they  knew  that  Christ  was  to  be  the 
Saviour  of  Israel,  yet  they  did  not  know  all  that  the  Holy  Ghost 
was  here  prophesying  about  Him  by  Simeon  and  Anna — that  He 
was  to  be  a light  enlightening  all  nations,  that  He  should  be  “ for 
the  ruin  and  for  the  resurrection  of  many  in  Israel,”  that  a sword 
should  pierce  the  soul  of  the  Virgin,  &c  Besides,  even  had  they 
known  these  things,  they  would  have  wondered  at  their  being  pro- 
claimed aloud  with  such  enthusiasm  and  ardour. 

Ver.  34. — And  Simeon  blessed  them , and  said  unto  Mary  His 
mother , Behold , this  child  is  set  for  the  fall  and  rising  again  of 
many  in  Israel ; and  for  a sign  which  shall  be  spoken  against.  The 
form  for  the  sacerdotal  blessing  is  prescribed  in  Num.  vL  24, 
“The  Lord  bless  thee,  and  keep  thee,”  &c. 

Blessed  them.  That  is,  Joseph  and  Mary,  not  the  Child  Christ, 
say  Maldonatus,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others ; for  the  Child,  as  his 
Saviour  and  his  God,  he  venerated  and  adored,  desiring  to  be 
blessed  by  Him,  and  not  presuming  to  bless  Him.  Jansenius, 
however,  thinks  that  the  word  “ them  ” includes  Christ 

And  said  unto  Mary  His  mother , rather  than  to  Joseph,  both 
because  she  was  the  true  and  natural  mother  of  Jesus,  while  Joseph 
was  only  nominally  His  father,  and  also  because  Joseph  seems  to 
have  died  before  the  thirtieth  year  of  Christ,  when  the  things  here 
foreshadowed  were  accomplished,  so  that  the  Blessed  Mary  alone 
experienced  them  in  herself.  To  her  alone,  then,  did  Simeon  here

foretell  both  the  happiness  and  the  adversity  which  are  to  befall 
Christ  and  her,  that  in  happiness  she  might  not  be  lifted  up  too 
much,  nor  be  cast  down  in  her  adversity. 

Set  for  the  fall  and  rising  again  of  many  in  Israel  For  fall  the 
Greek  has  and  so  the  Arabic.  The  allusion  is  to  Isa.  viiL  14, 

“ And  he  shall  be  for  a sanctuary ; but  for  a stone  of  stumbling  and 
a rock  of  offence  to  both  the  houses  of  Israel p (that  is),  “ for  a gin 
and  for  a snare  to  the  inhabitants  of  Jerusalem and  in  xxviii.  16, 
“ Behold,  I lay  in  Sion  for  a foundation  a stone,  a tried  stone,  a 
precious  corner-stone,  a sure  foundation ; " the  latter  text  is  quoted 
against  the  unbelieving  Jews  by  S.  Paul,  Rom.  ix.  33,  by  S.  Peter, 
1 Pet  ii.  6,  and  Acts  iv.  11,  and  by  Christ  Himself,  Matt.  xxi.  42. 
Christ  was  laid  and  placed  in  the  new,  that  is  the  Christian  Church 
as  a foundation  and  a corner-stone,  that  upon  Him  He  might  build 
all  those  that  believed  in  Him,  and  of  them  build  up  the  spiritual 
edifice  of  the  Church,  as  He  had  promised  to  Adam,  Abraham, 
Moses,  and  the  other  patriarchs  and  prophets.  God  did  this  directly 
with  the  intention  of  drawing  all  the  Israelites  to  the  faith  of  Christ, 
that  He  might  so  bring  them  into  His  Church  and  save  them ; 
but  He  foresaw  that  a great  part  of  them  would,  by  reason  of  their 
wickedness,  speak  against  Christ  when  He  came,  and  would  strike 
against  Him  as  on  a stone  of  offence,  and  that  so  they  would  be 
broken,  and  fall  into  ruin  both  temporal  and  eternal.  Yet  He  would 
not  change  His  resolve  of  sending  Christ,  but  would  permit  this 
rebellion  and  speaking  against  Him  on  the'  part  of  the  Jews  in 
order  that  it  might  be  the  occasion  for  S.  Paul  and  the  Apostles  to 
transfer  the  preaching  of  the  Gospel  from  them  who  resisted  it 
to  the  Gentiles;  and  that  so,  instead  of  a few  Jews,  numberless 
nations  might  believe  in  Christ,  be  built  in  to  Him  in  the  Church, 
and  oe  saved,  as  S.  Paul  shows  at  length  in  Rom.  x\.  Such  was 
the  design  of  God  by  which  He  set  Christ  as  the  corner-stone  of 
the  Church,  to  be  indirectly  “ for  the  fall?  but  directly  (tfor  the  rising 
again  of  many  in  Israel .”  By  fall  is  meant  the  destruction  ot  the 
Jews  who  rebelled  against  Christ ; by  rising  again,  the  salvation  of 
those  who  believe  in  Him  : for  they  that  rebelled  against  Christ

fell  from  faith  into  faithlessness,  from  the  hope  of  salvation  into 
despair  and  reprobation,  from  heaven  into  hell ; but  they  who 
believe  in  Him  have  risen  by  his  grace  from  the  sins  in  which  they 
lay  prostrate  to  a new  life  of  virtue  and  grace,  looking  for  the 
hope  of  glory.  Such  is  the  interpretation  of  S.  Augustine,  Bede, 
Theophylact,  Euthymius,  Toletus,  and  many  others;  indeed,  so  Christ 
Himself,  S.  Peter,  and  S.  Paul  interpret  in  the  places  quoted  above. 
S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa  also  interprets  “ ruin  ” as  the  devastation  of 
Judaea  and  Jerusalem  by  Titus ; for  this  calamity  came  upon  them 
because  they  set  at  nought  and  crucified  Christ 

Symbolically,  Theophylact  says  that  Christ  was  set  “ for  the  ruin 
and  the  resurrection  of  Israel,”  that  is,  of  the  penitent  soul  that 
sanctifies  itself  by  the  grace  of  Christ,  because  this  grace  brings 
it  to  pass  that  pride,  gluttony,  and  lust  fall  in  the  soul,  while 
humility,  abstinence,  and  chastity  rise  up  in  it. 

And  for  a sign  which  shall  be  spoken  against  In  Greek  th 
avriXtyofitw,  a sign  of  contradiction  or  of  contention,  as  the  Syriac  and 
Arabic  render  it  Tertullian  (de  Came  Christi ’,  c.  xxiii.)  renders 
it  " for  a contradictory  sign.” 

The  question  arises,  What  is  this  sign  ? 

1.  Maldonatus  and  Francis  Lucas  say  that  Christ  was  set  as 
an  archer’s  target  at  which  the  unbelieving  Jews  and  Scribes  hurled 
not  only  evil  words  with  the  tongue,  but  also  maleficent  weapons 
with  the  hand.  This  target  was  one  of  contradiction,  because  the 
Scribes  strove  together  and  contradicted  one  another  about  striking 
and  piercing  it.  So  that  Simeon  alludes  to  Lam.  iii.  1 2,  “ He  hath 
set  me  as  a mark  for  the  arrow,  he  hath  caused  the  arrows  of 
his  quiver  to  enter  into  my  reins.” 

2.  S.  Basil,  Bede,  and  Theophylact  understand  the  sign  of  the 
cross,  making  it  refer  to  Isa.  xl  10,  “In  that  day  there  shall  be  a 
root  of  Jesse  which  shall  stand  for  an  ensign  for  the  people.”  The 
Hebrew  word  translated  “ sign  ” is  pj,  nes,  a standard,  rendered  by 
the  Septuagint  etifiuo*,  which  is  the  word  here  used  by  Luke.  Christ, 
when  lifted  up  on  the  Cross,  is  to  be  a standard-bearer,  and  shall 
raise  the  banner  of  the  Cross,  to  which  He  will  draw  all  the  faithful

CHRIST  AS  A SIGN.

as  His  soldiers  to  fight  against  Jews,  Mohammedans,  Pagans,  and 
other  impious  soldiers  of  the  devil,  who  contradict  the  Cross  of 
Christ  and  fight  hard  against  it  So  Toletus  interprets. 

3.  The  most  obvious  interpretation  is  that  Simeon  is  alluding  to 
Isa.  viii.  18,  “ Behold  I and  the  children  whom  the  Lord  hath  given 
me  are  for  signs  and  for  wonders  in  Israel.”  The  wondrous,  strange, 
and  hitherto  unheard  of  birth  of  Christ  from  a virgin  is  here  called 
a “sign”  or  “wonder,”  and  His  Divine  teaching,  life,  death, 
resurrection,  and  miracles,  by  which  He  clearly  showed  Himself  to 
be  the  Messiah,  the  Saviour  of  the  world.  Against  this  “ sign  ” of 
Christ  not  only  do  Jews  and  heathens  speak  with  the  tongue,  but 
bad  Christians  also  by  their  wicked  lives.  So  Origen  and  Jansenius. 
S.  Basil,  commenting  on  “ Behold  a virgin  shall  conceive  ” (Isa.  vil), 
favours  this  view.  Tertullian  also  (JDe  Came  Christi)  makes  the 
allusion  to  Isa.  vil,  “ Therefore,  the  Lord  himself  shall  give  you  a 
sign  : Behold  a virgin  shall  conceive,  and  shall  bear  a son.  We 
recognise,  then,  the  contradictory  sign,  the  conception  and  child- 
bearing of  the  Virgin  Mary,  of  which  these  academicians  say  she 
bore  a child  and  bore  no  child,  she  was  a virgin  and  no  virgin.” 
And  these  cavillers  he  answers,  “ She  bore  a child  in  that  she  did 
so  of  her  own  flesh ; and  she  did  not  bear,  in  that  she  bore  not  of 
the  seed  of  man.  And  she  was  a virgin  for  man,  not  a virgin  for 
childbirth.” 

Symbolically,  Cajetan  says,  “Christ  was  the  sign  of  the  recon- 
ciliation of  the  human  race  with  God.”  And  Dionysius,  “The 
sign  of  the  covenant  between  God  and  man,  that  the  flood  was  no 
more  to  be  brought  upon  the  earth.”  Others  take  “ sign  ” as  that 
with  which  God’s  sheep  are  marked : Christians  are  to  be  marked 
with  the  faith  of  Christ,  His  baptism,  and  His  character  as  a sign, 
that  they  may  be  distinguished  from  infidels.  Baradius  thinks 
that  the  allusion  is  to  the  brazen  serpent  which  Moses  set  up,  for 
a sign,  that  those  who  looked  at  it  might  be  cured  of  the  serpent’s 
bite,  Num.  xxi.

Arabic  version,  lance;  the  Greek  means  both  sword  and 

lance  or  dart. 

What  is  this  sword  ? 

1.  Some  understand  doubt  in  her  faith ; that  the  Blessed  Virgin, 
when  she  saw  Christ  suffering  so  fearfully  from  the  violence  of  the 
Jews,  and  dying  on  the  Cross,  doubted  as  to  whether  He  would 
rise  again,  as  He  had  foretold.  In  this  sense  speak  Origen  (Horn. 
xvii.),  Titus,  Theophylact,  and  others.  This,  however,  is  an  error, 
for  such  a feeling  were  unworthy  the  Deipara,  and  that  she  experi- 
enced it  is  counter  to  the  common  sense  of  the  Church.  For  so 
the  Blessed  Virgin  would  have  sinned  by  unbelief.  Indeed,  the 
authors  cited  are  sometimes  explained  as  meaning  by  “doubt,” 
admiration,  mental  perturbation,  and  inward  questionings. 

2.  S.  Eucherius  of  Lyons  (Bom,  in  Bominicam\  understands 
the  sword  of  the  Spirit — the  word  of  God,  /.&,  the  spirit  of  prophecy, 
as  who  should  say,  The  sword  of  the  prophetic  spirit  shall  pass 
through  thy  soul,  O Mary,  to  reveal  to  thee  the  secrets  of  Holy 
Scripture  and  the  hidden  thoughts  of  men,  as  in  Cana  of  Galilee 
when  thou  shalt  say,  “ Whatsoever  He  telleth  you,  do  it,”  knowing 
that  Christ  will  command  them  to  draw  the  water  which  He  is  to 
turn  into  wine.  So  it  is  that  the  Apostle  says  in  Heb.  iv.  12,  “The 
word  of  the  Lord  is  quick,  and  powerful,  and  sharper  than  any 
two-edged  sword,  piercing  even  to  the  dividing  asunder  of  soul  and 
spirit,  and  of  the  joints  and  marrow,  and  is  a discemer  of  the 
thoughts  and  intents  of  the  heart.”  And  S.  Ambrose  understands 
it  of  the  prudence  of  the  Virgin,  who  was  not  without  knowledge 
of  heavenly  secrets. 

3.  It  has  been  supposed  by  some,  as  Amphilochius  (Horn,  De 
Occurs . Bom,)  bears  witness,  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  really  received 
the  crown  of  martyrdom  by  the  sword,  but  this  is  contrary  to  all 
belief  in  history. 

4.  The  true  interpretation  of  “sword”  here  is  with  reference 
to  the  sufferings  indicted  on  Christ,  or  rather  contradiction  spoken 
of  a little  before;  for  the  contradiction  of  the  tongue  is  spoken 
of  in  Scripture  as  a sword,  as  in  Ps.  lvii.  4,  “ The  sons  of  men,  whose

teeth  are  spears  and  arrows,  and  their  tongue  a sharp  sword and 
Pa.  lxiv.  3,  “ Who  whet  their  tongues  like  a sword  ; ” and  Ps. 
cv.  1 8,  “The  sword  hath  passed  through  His  sour’  (Vulg.)  This 
sword,  then,  is  twofold,  (i.)  The  sword  of  the  tongue.  For  the 
Blessed  Virgin,  hearing  the  insults,  calumnies,  and  blasphemies 
with  which  Christ  was  assailed  by  the  Jews,  even  when  He  was 
crucified,  suffered  intense  tortures,  just  as  though  a sword  had  been 
struck  through  her  soul.  (2.)  The  sword  of  iron — the  nails  and 
other  torments  which  not  only  pierced  the  body  and  soul  of  Christ, 
but  also  pierced  the  soul  of  the  Virgin.  Just  as  when  a man 
stabs  with  a sword  at  two  persons  who  are  next  each  other  so  as 
to  kill  the  one  and  pierce  and  wound  the  other.  Such  is  the 
interpretation  of  S.  Augustine  (Ep.  59,  ad  Paulinum),  Sophronius 
{Bom.  de  Assumption*),  Francis  Lucas,  Jansenius,  Toletus,  Barradius, 
and  others. 

How  great  was  the  torture  inflicted  by  this  sword  we  may  gather, 
with  Toletus,  First,  from  the  fact  that  it  was  her  Son  Who  suffered, 
whom  the  Mother  of  God  loved  more  than  herself,  so  that  she 
would  far  rather  have  suffered  and  been  crucified  herself  Love  is 
the  measure  of  sorrow.  Secondly , from  the  severity  of  Christ’s 
torments  and  the  wideness  of  their  extent;  for  He  suffered  the 
most  fearful  agonies  in  all  His  senses  and  all  His  members,  and 
all  this  the  Blessed  Virgin  endured  also  by  her  sympathy  with 
Him.  Thirdly , the  dignity  of  the  Personage  who  suffered ; for  the 
Blessed  Virgin  pondered  deeply  the  fact  that  this  was  the  True 
God,  the  Messiah,  and  Saviour  of  the  World.  Fourthly , the  long 
duration  of  His  sufferings ; for  Christ  suffered  ail  His  life  long, 
until  He  breathed  forth  His  Soul  on  the  Cross.  Fifthly,  His 
loneliness;  for  He  suffered  alone,  deserted  by  His  Apostles  and 
all  His  friends,  by  the  angels,  and  by  God  Himself,  so  that  He 
cried  aloud,  “ My  God ! why  hast  Thou  forsaken  Me  ? ” For, 
though  the  Blessed  Virgin  stood  by  Him  and  suffered  with  Him, 
yet  did  the  Mother’s  anguish  but  add  a new  pang  to  the  Son’s 
torments,  and  this  grief  again  had  its  echo  in  the  Mother’s  soul. 

So  it  is  that  S.  John  of  Damascus  (de  Fide,  lib.  iv.  cap.  xv.)  remarks,

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


“The  pains  she  had  escaped  in  childbirth  she  bore  at  the  time  of 
His  Passion,  so  that  she  felt  her  bosom  tom  asunder  by  reason  of 
the  depth  of  her  maternal  love.”  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the 
doctors  teach  that  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  a martyr,  and  more  than 
a martyr.  As  Christ,  in  His  Passion,  was  tormented  more  than  all 
the  martyrs,  so  too  was  the  Blessed  Virgin  by  her  sympathy  with 
Him  ; and  by  this  torment  she  would  have  been  overcome  and 
would  have  died  had  not  God  preserved  her  life  by  His  special 
support.  As,  therefore,  S.  John  the  evangelist,  who  was  put  into 
the  vessel  of  boiling  oil,  is  a martyr,  because  this  suffering  would,  in 
the  natural  course,  have  resulted  in  his  death,  if  God  had  not 
preserved  his  life  by  a miracle,  so  also  is  the  Blessed  Virgin. 

It  may  be  objected  to  this  that  the  Jews  did  not  wish  to  torture 
or  kill  the  Blessed  Virgin,  but  only  Christ  But,  in  torturing  Christ, 
they  tortured  His  Virgin  Mother,  just  as  he  who  tortures  the  body 
tortures  the  soul,  for  she  was  more  closely  joined  to  Christ  in 
feeling  than  the  body  to  the  soul.  Besides,  the  Jews  persecuted 
all  the  relatives  of  Christ,  as  they  did  His  apostles  and  disciples, 
out  of  hatred  of  Him.  S.  Bridget  (Serm.  Angelic . cc.  xvii.,  xviii.) 
gives  a pathetic  account  of  the  strength  of  this  sword  of  the  Virgin’s 
sorrow. 

Symbolically,  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  xxix.)  interprets  this  sword  or 
dart  as  love : for  where  there  is  sorrow  there  too  is  love ; in  love 
there  is  no  living  without  sorrow,  nor  in  sorrow  without  love. 
“The  chosen  arrow,”  he  says,  “is  the  love  of  Christ,  which  not 
only  pierced,  but  pierced  through  and  through,  the  soul  of  Mary, 
so  that  it  left  in  her  virginal  breast  not  the  smallest  part  void  of 
love,  but  with  all  her  heart,  and  all  her  soul,  and  all  her  strength, 
she  loved.  And  truly,  again,  it  penetrated  through  her  to  come  to 
us,  that  of  that  fulness  we  might  all  receive,  and  she  might  be  the 
Mother  of  that  love  whose  father  is  the  love  of  God.  . . . And  in 
her  whole  self  did  she  receive  the  vast  sweet  wound  of  love. 
Happy  shall  I think  myself  if  sometimes  I may  feel  pricked  with 
but  the  very  tip  of  that  sword’s  point,  that  my  soul  too  may  say,  I 
am  wounded  with  love.”

THE  INTERPRETATION  OF  “ SWORD.”  12$ 

That  the  thoughts  of  many  hearts  may  be  revealed . An  obscure 
sentence,  and  difficult  of  interpretation. 

1.  S.  Hilary,  who  by  “ sword  ” understands  the  Day  of  Judgment, 
easily  settles  the  difficulty.  The  sword,  he  interprets,  shall  dissect 
and  lay  open  the  hearts  of  men — even  of  the  Blessed  Virgin. 
This  is  the  force  of  the  words  of  the  Apocalypse  about  Christ, 
“And  from  His  mouth  there  went  forth  a sharp  two-edged  sword” 
(c.  L v.  16). 

2.  Eucherius,  taking  “ sword  ” as  the  spirit  of  prophecy,  interprets 
that  this  sword  was  given  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  that  she  might  know 
the  secret  thoughts  of  men. 

3.  Euthymius — Many,  seeing  the  miracles  and  the  wisdom  of 
Jesus,  thought  within  themselves  that  He  had  descended  from 
Heaven,  and  was  not  the  son  of  Mary ; but,  when  they  saw  her  at 
the  cross  of  Christ,  mourning  and  in  such  tribulation,  they  aban- 
doned this  idea,  believing  that  she  who  felt  His  sorrows  so  deeply 
must  be  His  mother  indeed 

4.  S.  Augustine  (£f.  59,  near  the  end) — “By  the  Lord’s  Passion 
both  the  plots  of  the  Jews  and  the  infirmity  of  the  disciples  were 
made  manifest,”  for  they  forsook  Christ  and  fled.  This  is  apposite 
with  respect  to  the  Jews,  but  not  so  applicable  as  to  the  disciples, 
for  the  latter  did  not  meditate  flight  beforehand 

5.  Toletus  interprets  concisely — The  sword  that  shall  pierce  thy 
soul,  O Virgin,  shall  be  the  occasion  of  revealing  the  thoughts  of 
many  hearts  that  before  lay  hidden.  For,  long  before  Christ  was 
slain,  the  leaders  of  the  Jews  had  the  intention  of  slaying  Him,  but 
dared  make  no  attempt  against  Him,  for  fear  of  the  people.  But 
then  the  Jews  had  already  before  the  Passion  made  manifest  their 
thoughts  about  Christ,  by  cavilling  at  His  words  and  works, 
although  they  concealed  their  desire  to  slay  Him. 

6.  The  fullest  and  most  obvious  explanation  is  that  which  makes 
the  “that"  expressive  both  of  the  purpose  and  its  attainment,  and 
refers  it  both  to  the  sword  and  the  words  of  the  preceding  verse, 
“ This  child  is  set  for  the  fall,”  &c.  That  is  to  say,  that  the  Scribes 
and  Pharisees,  who,  like  the  heretics  of  to-day,  appeared  to  be  the

upholders  of  justice  and  truth,  may  show  the  world  how  antagonistic 
they  are  to  the  true  Messiah  and  to  justice,  and  what  evil  designs 
they  cherish  against  Him.  For,  before  the  advent  of  Christ,  they 
were  in  hopes  that  He  would  come  with  pomp  and  with  wealth, 
even  as  Solomon,  so  that  they  might  be  raised  by  Him  in  honour 
and  riches ; but  when  they  saw  Him  in  His  humility  and  poverty 
opposing  Himself  to  their  ambition  and  avarice,  and  publicly 
rebuking  them  for  it,  they  set  Him  at  nought  and  opposed  Him, 
secretly  scheming  to  bring  upon  Him  the  destruction  which  they 
at  length  actually  compassed.  Then  was  it  revealed  who  in  Israel 
were  just,  for  these  loved  Christ  sincerely  and  with  constancy; 
and  who  unjust,  for  these  persecuted  and  slew  Him.  So  S. 
Augustine  (Ep.  59),  Bede,  Jansenius,  Maldonatus,  Francis  Lucas, 
and  others.  The  explanation  of  Toletus  also  tallies  with  this  to 
some  extent 

Ver.  36. — And  there  was  one  Anna,  a prophetess , the  daughter  of 
Phanuel , of  the  tribe  of  Aser:  she  was  of  a great  age,  and  had  lived 
with  an  husband  seven  years  from  her  virginity.  She  was  an  old 
woman,  so  that  she  was  prompted  by  no  youthful  fervour,  but  bore 
testimony  to  Christ  in  a mature  and  grave  manner.  “Anna”  in 
Hebrew  signifies  grace — of  which  Anna  was  full.  The  name 
“ Grace  ” is  still  often  borne  by  women,  and  was  the  name  of  her 
who  at  Firando,  in  Japan,  generously  met  a glorious  death,  together 
with  her  four  children  and  her  whole  household,  for  the  faith 
of  Christ. 

A prophetess — that  is,  a teacher,  says  Francis  Lucas — one  who 
instructed  the  young  women  in  the  law  of  God  and  in  piety ; for  at 
this  time  the  Jews  had  no  prophets  who  foretold  future  events. 
But  that  Anna  foretold  the  hidden  things  of  the  future  is  clear  from 
v.  38,  where  she  prophesied  about  Christ  For,  though  the  Jews  had 
no  prophets  until  the  time  of  Christ,  yet  God  raised  up  prophets  at 
that  time,  such  as  John,  Zachary,  Elizabeth,  and  Simeon.  Hence  S. 
Ambrose  says,  “The  birth  of  the  Lord  received  testimony  not  only 
from  the  angels,  from  the  shepherds,  and  from  His  parents,  but 
also  from  the  aged  and  good ; every  age,  and  both  sexes,  and  the

wondrous  nature  of  events,  build  up  our  faith.  A virgin  conceives 
— the  barren  brings  forth — the  dumb  speaks — Elizabeth  prophesies, 
— the  wise  man  adores — he  that  is  shut  up  in  the  womb  exults — 
the  widow  confesses — the  just  man  is  waiting  for  His  coming.” 

The  daughter  of  Phanuel.  Phanuel  was  a well-known  man  at  that 
time.  “Phanuel”  in  Hebrew  signifies  “the  face  of  God” — his 
daughter  is  “Anna” — grace;  for  grace  proceeds  from  the  face 
and  from  the  mouth  of  God,  and  is  breathed  into  the  faithful 
The  place  where  Jacob  saw  God  face  to  face,  was  called  by  him 
Peniel  or  “ Phanuel,”  Gen.  xxxil  30. 

She  was  of  a great  age , and  had  lived  with  an  husband  seven  years 
from  her  virginity — that  is,  from  the  time  when  she  became  of  mar- 
riageable age ; for  infants,  who  have  not  yet  reached  this  age,  are  not 
properly  virgins.  Again,  from  the  time  of  her  marriage  which  she 
contracted  as  a virgin.  They  were  wont  to  marry  soon  after  attaining 
puberty — in  their  fifteenth  year,  the  age  at  which  the  Blessed  Virgin 
was  married  to  Joseph.  Hence  we  gather  (1)  that  Anna  was  married 
once,  and  that  in  the  first  years  of  her  puberty;  (2)  that,  before 
her  marriage,  she  lived  chastely ; (3)  that,  when,  after  seven  years 
of  her  married  life,  her  husband  died,  becoming  a widow  at  the 
early  age  of  twenty-two,  she,  with  remarkable  continency,  in  the 
flower  of  her  life  remained  a widow  until  the  age  of  eighty-four, 
or,  as  S.  Ambrose  interprets,  until  the  eighty-fourth  year  of  her 
widowhood.  If  this  last  interpretation  be  correct,  she  must,  when 
she  met  Christ,  have  been  one  hundred  and  six  years  old.  It 
seems  that  God  prolonged  the  life  of  Anna  to  this  great  age  with 
the  special  design  that  she  might  see  and  bear  testimony  to  Christ, 
even  as  He  prolonged  that  of  Simeon. 

Ver.  37. — And  she  was  a widow  of  about  fourscore  and  four  years 
(of  age,  or,  according  to  S.  Ambrose,  of  her  widowhood),  which 
departed  not  from  the  Temple.  Not  that  she  lived  in  the  Temple, 
but  she  frequented  it,  and  spent  much  time  in  it.  So  think  Toletus, 
Jansenius,  and  Maldonatus.  Others,  however,  think  that  she 
actually  dwelt  in  the  Temple ; for  hard  by  the  Temple  there  were 
houses  of  religious  women  who  served  God  “ night  and  day  ” — as

there  afterwards  were  of  deaconesses  in  the  Christian  Church,  and 
still  are  of  nuns.  This  appears  from  Exod.  xxxviii.  8 ; 2 Maccabees 
iii.  20;  and  1 Sam.  il  22.  These  religious  women  were  some 
virgins,  and  some  widows,  of  which  latter  it  seems  that  Anna  was 
one,  as  Canisius  ( Marialis , lib.  i.  xii.)  argues. 

But  served  God  with  fastings  and  prayers  night  and  day — that 
is,  serving  God,  as  the  Arabic  renders  it  The  Greek  Xarpvouea, 
worshipping  with  “ latria  ” — latria  being  due  to  God  only.  Hence 
is  plain  the  falsehood  of  the  teaching  of  the  heretics,  that  fasting 
is  only  a mortification  of  the  body,  and  no  worship  of  God,  except 
in  so  far  as  it  is  understood  to  mean  prayer  ; for  S.  Luke  here  says 
that  Anna  served  God  both  with  fastings  and  prayers.  By  means 
of  her  fastings  and  prayers  she  served  God  “night  and  day.* 
S-  Chrysostom  ( Horn . 42,  ad  pop.)  eloquently  commends  prayer 
made  by  night : “ Behold,”  he  says,  “ the  company  of  the  stars, 
the  deep  silence,  the  great  calm,  and  admire  the  dispensation  of 
thy  Lord.  For  then  is  the  mind  purer,  lighter,  and  more  subtle^ 
more  sublime  and  agile.  The  darkness  itself  and  the  great  silence 
have  the  power  of  inducing  compunction.  And  if  thou  lookest 
upon  the  sky,  dotted  with  numberless  stars  as  with  eyes  . . . 
bend  thy  knees,  groan,  pray  thy  Lord  to  be  propitious  to  thee. 
He  is  the  more  appeased  by  prayers  made  in  the  night,  when  thou 
makest  the  time  of  rest  the  time  of  thy  struggles.  Remember  the 
King,  what  words  he  said  : " I am  weary  of  my  groaning,  every 
night  wash  I my  bed,  and  water  my  couch  with  my  tears.”  So 
Christ  used  to  give  the  day  to  preaching,  the  night  to  prayer, 
Luke  vL  12.  So  too  S.  Paul,  Acts  xvi.  25,  and  2 Tim.  i*  3.  So  SL 
Anthony,  S.  Hilarion,  and  the  other  anchorites ; nay,  the  Church 
also,  as  is  plain  from  the  “Nocturas”  which  monks  still  chant 
by  night 

Ver.  38. — And  she  coming  in  that  instant  gave  thanks  likewise 
unto  the  Lord.  In  Greek  a»0«/xoXoyi7ro,  confessed  to  God  in  her 
turn , as  though  singing  in  answer  to  Simeon  from  the  choir  set  apart 
for  the  other  sex,  praised  the  Lord,  and  gave  Him  thanks  for  the 
gift  of  Christ  and  His  birth.

THE  RETURN  TO  NAZARETH.

And  spake  of  Him — of  the  Lord  Christ,  whom  she  had  there 
present.  Not  only  did  Anna  praise  God,  but  she  began  to  dis- 
course to  others  of  Jesus,  asserting  Him  to  be  the  Christ,  and 
exhorting  all  to  believe  in  Him. 

To  all  them  that  looked  for  redemption  in  Jerusalem,  The  Redeemer 
Christ,  who  redeems  from  sin,  death,  Satan,  and  Hell,  Israel,  that 
is,  the  people  of  the  faithful  who  believe  in  Him. 

Allegorically , Christ,  when  bom,  appeared  to  three  groups  of 
persons  in  three  ways — (i)  to  the  shepherds,  at  the  indication 
of  an  angel;  (2)  to  the  magi,  under  the  guidance  of  a star; 
(3)  to  Simeon  and  Anna,  guided  by  the  Holy  Ghost  Again, 
the  shepherds  saw  Christ,  the  Magi  adored  Him,  but  Simeon  and 
Anna  embraced  Him.  So  we  first  recognise  Christ,  then  adore 
Him,  and  then,  when  we  are  no  longer  children  in  virtue,  but  old 
men,  embrace  Him  with  arms  of  love.  So  Jansenius  teaches. 

Ver.  40. — And  when  they  had  performed  all  things  according  to 
the  law  of  the  Lord,  they  returned  into  Galilee,  to  their  own  city 
of  Nazareth,  And  from  thence,  fearing  the  Infanticide  Herod,  they 
fled,  with  the  Child  Jesus,  into  Egypt  The  massacre  of  the 
innocents  took  place,  says  Euthymius,  Toletus,  and  others,  a 
little  after  the  purification  of  the  Virgin,  and  about  the  time  of 
the  Passover.  S.  Augustine,  however  (de  Consens.  Evang. , lib.  ii. 
cap.  v.),  Jansenius,  and  Francis  Lucas,  think  that  they  fled  immedi- 
ately from  Jerusalem,  and  returning  thence  nine  years  after,  went 
back  to  Nazareth,  as  S.  Luke  here  says.  See  Commentary  on  S.  Matt. 
iL  13.  Moreover,  they  returned  to  Nazareth,  before  their  flight, 
in  order  to  arrange  their  affairs  there,  and  to  prepare  what  was 
necessary  for  the  long  journey  to  Egypt  And  there  was  abundance 
of  time  for  their  flight,  since  the  interval  between  the  2d  of 
February — the  date  of  the  Purification  and  the  Passover,  when 
the  massacre  is  said  to  have  taken  place — is  about  two  mouths. 

Ver.  40. — And  the  child  grew , and  waxed  strong  in  spirit.  The 
Greek,  Syriac,  and  Arabic  add  “in  spirit and  Euthymius  explains 
it  that  Christ  did  not  receive  greater  spiritual  strength  inwardly 
day  by  day,  since  He  was  full  of  grace  and  the  Holy  Ghost  from

the  first  moment  of  His  conception,  but  that  He  exhibited  this 
strength  more  and  more  outwardly  by  word  and  work.  The 
Latin  version,  the  Latin  fathers,  and  the  interpreter  reject  “in 
spirit,”  as  also  Origen  and  Titus  among  the  Greeks. 

Filled  with  wisdom . The  Greek  tXjj otvium  means  both  to  be 
being  filled  and  to  be  fully  so  as  to  be  equivalent  to  The 

Arabic  renders  “was  being  filled  again  with  wisdom,”  the  Syriac 
“was  being  filled  with  wisdom.”  So  also  Origen,  Theophylact, 
Euthymius,  and  Titus  on  this  passage,  and  S.  Ambrose  (de  In- 
cam.  Dom . Sad.  cap.  vii.)  Theophylact  explains — Not  acquiring 
wisdom  (for  what  could  be  more  perfect  than  He  who  was  perfect 
from  the  beginning?)  but  discovering  it  little  by  little.  For  had 
He  manifested  all  His  wisdom  whilst  he  was  small  in  stature,  He 
would  have  appeared,  as  it  were,  monstrous,  and  as  though  not 
really  a child,  but  a phantasm  of  a child. 

And  the  Grace  of  God  was  upon  Him.  In  the  Greek  W aurov. 
All  the  favour,  goodwill,  care,  and  love  of  God  the  Father  towards 
the  Child  Jesus,  as  His  Son,  brooded,  as  it  were,  over  Him  from 
out  of  the  heavens,  to  adorn  Him  with  gifts  and  graces,  to  guide 
and  dispose  Him  in  all  His  actions,  that  all  might  see  that  He  was 
ruled,  and  in  all  things  directed  by  God,  and  that  His  actions  were 
not  so  much  human  as  Divine.  So  says  Euthymius.  In  a similar 
manner  it  is  said  of  John  the  Baptist,  “ And  the  hand  of  the  Lord 
was  with  him,”  Luke  i.  66. 

Ver.  41. — Now  His  parents  went  to  Jerusalem  every  year  at  the 
feast  of  the  Passover.  God  had  commanded  that  every  man  should 
go  to  the  Tabernacle  or  Temple  three  times  a year,  there  to  adore 
God  publicly  and  offer  Him  sacrifices,  Exod.  xxiii.  14  and  Deut  xvi. 
16.  The  Blessed  Virgin,  although  not  bound  by  the  law,  still,  out  of 
devotion,  after  her  return  from  Egypt,  joined  her  husband,  and 
brought  her  son  with  her  to  the  Temple,  that  she  might  teach  mothers 
to  bring  their  children,  from  their  tender  years,  to  the  Temple,  and 
to  worship  God.  So  say  Bede,  Maldonatus,  Jansenius,  Francis 
Lucas,  and  others.  Nor  did  she  fear  Archelaus  the  son  of  the 
Infanticide  Herod,  both  because  she  thought  with  good  reason  that,

in  so  large  a concourse  of  Jews,  they  would  be  able  to  escape 
observation  for  a few  days,  and  also  because  she  knew  that  God, 
for  whose  honour  she  underwent  this  risk,  had  her  in  His  mind  and 
in  His  keeping.  So  says  S.  Augustine  (de  Consens.  Evang .,  lib.  ii. 
cap  x.),  and  S.  Luke  implies  as  much  in  the  next  two  verses.  Some, 
however,  think,  with  some  probability,  that  Jesus  only  went  up  to 
Jerusalem  in  the  twelfth  year  of  His  age,  for  in  that  year  Archelaus 
was  exiled  by  Augustus. 

Ver.  42. — And  when  He  was  twelve  years  old,  they  went  up  to 
Jerusalem  after  the  custom  of  the  feast  The  Syriac  has  “ as  they  had 
been  accustomed  on  the  feast n — namely,  of  the  Passover. 

Ver.  43. — And  when  they  had fulfilled  the  days , as  they  returned \ the 
child  fesus  tarried  behind  in  ferusalem.  In  the  Greek,  after  they  had 
finished , or  gone  through , the  days — namely,  of  the  Passover ; for  this 
feast  was  kept  for  seven  days,  and  S.  Luke  here  implies  that  Mary 
and  Joseph  kept  all  these  days  at  Jerusalem,  though  they  were  not 
bound  by  the  law  to  remain  so  long — tarried  behind  in  Jerusalem, 
there  to  shed  some  little  ray  of  His  wisdom  and  Divinity,  as  though 
longing  to  begin  the  ministry  for  which  His  Father  had  sent  Him. 
For  at  the  age  of  twelve  childhood  ends,  and  youth  and  perfect 
judgment  begin.  So  says  Bede. 

And  Joseph  and  his  mother  knew  not  of  it , because  Jesus  asked 
leave  of  His  parents,  who  were  lingering  a little  in  Jerusalem  from 
motives  of  devotion  or  business,  to  visit  His  relations,  as  if  he  were 
about  to  go  on  with  them,  and,  having  obtained  permission,  went  to 
them,  but  soon  withdrew  quietly  to  the  Temple — God  so  directing 
—in  order  that  His  parents,  though  at  other  times  always  solicitous 
about  Him,  should  be  unaware  of  this,  and  think  that  He  was  in 
the  company  of  His  kinsfolk. 

Ver.  44. — But  they , supposing  him  to  have  been  in  the  company,  went 
a dafs  journey  \ and  they  sought  Him  among  their  kinsfolk  and 
acquaintance , who  had  gone  on,  and  with  whom  Mary  and  Joseph, 
who  were  about  to  follow  a little  later,  would  that  evening  lodge 
and,  as  they  thought,  there  find  Jesus. 

Ver.  45. — And  when  they  found  him  not,  they  turned  back  again  to

Jerusalem,  seeking  Him.  Jesus  having  been  seen  by  none  of  His 
kinsfolk  on  the  way,  His  parents  understood  that  He  must  have 
remained  in  Jerusalem ; and  so  they  sought  Him  there  with  great 
anxiety.  Origen  gives  the  reason,  and  Theophylact  and  Titus 
follow  him.  “ But  did  they  seek  Him  so  anxiously  ? Did  they 
imagine  that  the  Child  had  been  lost,  or  had  wandered  from  the 
way  ? ” Far  otherwise,  “ For  this  would  not  have  been  character- 
istic of  Mary's  wisdom  (she  knew  that  Jesus  was  full  of  wisdom,  yea, 
that  He  was  God),  and  they  could  never  have  thought  that  the 
Child  was  lost,  when  they  knew  that  He  was  Divine,  but  they  sought 
Him  lest  by  any  means  He  might  have  gone  away  from  them ; lest 
perchance  He  had  left  them ; ” lest  He  should  wish  to  remain  not 
with  them  at  Nazareth,  but  with  others  in  Jerusalem,  that  He  might 
there  make  haste  to  begin  the  ministry  of  teaching  for  which  He 
had  been  sent  by  God.  Origen  adds,  “They  sought  Him,  lest 
perchance  He  might  have  gone  away  from  them,  lest  He  might 
have  left  them  and  betaken  Himself  elsewhere — or  as  seems  most 
probable — lest  He  might  have  returned  to  heaven,  to  descend  from 
thence  when  it  should  please  Him  . . . but  she  mourned  because 
she  was  a mother,  and  the  mother  of  a Son  worthy  of  her  immea- 
surable love — because  He  had  departed  without  her  knowledge, 
and  quite  contrary  to  her  expectation.” 

S.  Antoninus  adds  that  the  mother  of  Jesus  feared  lest  He  might 
have  fallen  into  the  hands  of  Archelaus,  the  son  of  Herod  the 
Infanticide,  who  would  slay  Him.  Euthymius  and  Francis  Lucas 
think  she  feared  lest  Christ  might  have  wandered  from  the  road, 
since  He  did  not  thoroughly  know  all  the  way.  For,  though  He 
knew  its  turns  and  windings  by  His  Divine  and  infused  wisdom, 
yet,  according  to  the  experimental  knowledge  which  He,  as  a child, 
was  following,  He  did  not  know  it.  Whether  this  be  correct  I 
leave  to  theologians  to  decide. 

Ver.  46. — And  it  came  to  pass , that  after  three  days  they  found 
Him  in  the  Temple,  sitting  in  the  midst  of  the  doctors , both  hearing 
them  and  asking  them  questions . After  thru  days,  that  is,  on  the 
third  day.  The  first  day  was  that  on  which  they  left  Jerusalem  ; the

second,  that  on  which,  not  finding  Him  at  the  inn,  they  returned ; 
and  the  third,  when  they  sought  and  found  the  Holy  Child  in  the 
Holy  Temple.  So  S.  Ambrose,  Euthymius,  and  others.  Just  as  we 
read  in  ver.  21,  “When  the  eight  days  were  accomplished” — that  is, 
on  the  eighth  day — Jesus  was  circumcised.  And  in  S.  Mark  viii. 
31,  “The  Son  of  Man  must  suffer  many  things  . . . after  three  days 
(that  is,  on  the  third  day)  to  rise  again.” 

In  the  Temple — For  the  place  of  God  Incarnate  is  in  the  Temple. 
There  is  He  to  be  sought,  there  shall  He  be  found — not  in  the 
market-place,  not  in  the  tavern,  not  in  the  theatre.  S.  Basil  and  S. 
Gregory  Nazianzen  imitated  Christ,  for  they,  according  to  Ruffinus, 
when  they  were  studying  at  Athens,  knew  but  two  streets  in  the  city 
— one  led  to  the  church  and  the  other  to  the  school. 

The  whole  of  these  three  days,  then,  Jesus  spent  in  praying  and 
hearing  and  answering  the  doctors  in  the  Temple;  His  food  He 
received  from  the  doctors,  who,  being  present,  and  admiring  His 
wisdom,  invited  Him.  Others,  with  less  probability,  think  that 
He  lived  by  begging  from  door  to  door;  such  is  the  opinion  of 
S.  Bernard  ( Horn . infra  Oct.  Epiphan.\  Bonaventura,  Alensis,  and 
others.  SL  Thomas,  in  the  Summa,  favours  this  view,  proving  that 
Christ  did  sometimes  beg,  from  the  words  of  Ps.  xl  17,  “But 
I am  poor  and  needy.”  On  the  other  hand,  Nicholas  de 
Lyra,  Dionysius  the  Carthusian,  John  the  Greater,  commenting 
on  this  passage,  and  John  of  Avila,  on  S.  Matt  xvit,  hold  that 
Christ  never  begged,  begging  having  been  unlawful  among  the 
Jews.  “ There  shall  be  no  poor  among  you,”  Deut.  xv.  4.  How- 
ever, these  words  are  not  a precept,  but  a promise  of  riches,  if 
they  obey  the  Law  of  God.

had  departed  from  Judah,  and  the  seventy  weeks  of  Daniel  and 
other  oracles  of  the  prophets  were  now  fulfilled.  It  is  very

of  the  Messiah,  so  that  His  manifestation  might  not  be  unexpected, 
but  that,  afterwards,  when  preaching  and  working  miracles,  He  might

To  teach  the  young  modesty,  and  the  desire  to  hear,  to  question, 
and  to  learn,  “ Lest,”  says  Bede,  “ if  they  will  not  be  disciples  of  the 
truth,  they  become  masters  of  error.”  (3.)  That,  asking  them 
questions,  He  might  be  questioned  in  turn  by  them,  and  might  teach 
them  by  His  replies. 

Ver.  47. — And  all  that  heard  Him  were  astonished  at  His  under- 
standing and  answers.  That  a child  of  twelve,  the  son  of  a 
carpenter,  one  who  had  never  attended  the  schools,  should  be  so 
versed  in  Holy  Scripture,  should  question  so  wisely  and  answer  so 
intelligently  as  to  surpass  even  the  doctors  themselves,  so  that  they 
said,  “What  thinkest  thou  that  this  child  will  be?” — will  He  be  a 
Prophet  ? will  He  be  the  Messiah,  whom  we  all  anxiously  expect 
from  day  to  day  to  be  the  Teacher  of  the  World  ? 

Ver.  48. — And  when  they  saiv  him , they  were  amazed.  His 
parents,  who  were  seeking  Him,  wondered  and  rejoiced  at  finding 
him  alone  disputing  with  the  doctors,  manifesting  such  wisdom, 
while  the  doctors,  and  all  the  rest  who  were  present,  wondered  at 
Him. 

And  His  mother  said  unto  Him , Son,  why  hast  thou  thus  dealt  with 
us  t behold , Thy  father  and  / have  sought  thee  sorrowing — the  Arabic 
adds,  “ with  labour.”  Such  are  the  words  of  His  mother,  not  as  find- 
ing fault  with  Christ,  but  in  wonder  and  in  sorrow,  and  sorrowfully 
unfolding  her  grief.  The  reverence  felt  by  this  mother  for  her  Child 
— the  God-Man — assures  us  of  this ; so  it  is  most  likely  that  she  said 
this  to  Him,  not  publicly  in  the  assemblage  of  doctors,  but  privately, 
calling  Him  aside,  or  when  the  assembly  had  dispersed.  So 
Jansenius,  Maldonatus,  and  others. 

Thy  father  and  I.  S.  Augustine  (Serm.  63  De  JDwersis9  xi.) 
remarks  upon  the  humility  of  the  Virgin,  who,  knowing  that  she

was  in  every  sense  (in  solidum)  the  Mother  of  Christ,  and,  therefore, 
of  God,  and  that  Joseph  had  no  part  in  begetting  Him,  yet  modestly 
puts  herself  after  Joseph  as  her  husband.  “ She  expresses  herself 
always,”  says  an  anonymous  writer  in  the  “ Catena  Graeca,”  like  a 
mother,  with  trustfulness,  humility,  and  affection.” 

Tropologically,  let  the  soul  that  has  separated  itself  from  Jesus  by 
mortal  sin,  or  from  its  wonted  communion  with  Him  by  venial  negli- 
gence, seek  Him  again  (1)  with  the  sorrow  and  tears  of  a penitent 
heart,  for,  as  S.  Gregory  Nazianzen  says  {Orat.  3),  “ The  tears  of 
righteous  men  ” (and  of  sinful  too,  if  they  repent)  “ are  the  flood  that 
covers  sin,  and  the  expiation  of  the  world,  as  was  Noah’s  flood;  (2) 
with  earnestness  and  solicitude,  as  the  Blessed  Virgin  did,  and  that  in 
the  Temple,  by  passing  some  time  in  prayer  and  in  spiritual  reading 
and  meditation ; (3)  among  the  doctors,  among  learned  and  good 
men,  who  shall  instruct  the  soul  as  well  in  knowledge  as  in  piety. 

Ver.  49. — And  He  said  unto  them,  How  is  it  that  ye  sought  me  f 
wist  ye  not  that  1 must  be  about  my  Fathers  business  ? S.  Ambrose 
holds  that  these  are  the  words  of  one  administering  reproof.  And 
Christ,  as  the  Messiah,  and  as  a Lawgiver,  might  rightfully  have 
reproved  His  mother  had  she  sinned.  But  there  was  no  blemish 
of  sin  in  His  mother,  neither  therefore  was  there  any  reproof  on  the 
part  of  Christ  Still,  there  is  in  the  words  a certain  sharpness  of 
tone,  savouring  of  reproof,  that  He  may  teach  them  by  His  question 
and  incite  them  the  more  keenly  to  learn  the  things  that  concerned 
Him,  just  as  parents  are  wont  to  stimulate  their  children  to  zeal  and 
diligence  with  sharp  words,  and  masters  their  pupils.  These  words 
of  Christ,  then,  are  the  words  of  one  instructing  and  consoling; 
excusing  himself,  and  defending  what  he  has  done  : — There  was  no 
need  for  you  to  seek  Me,  for  you  might  have  considered  that  I was 
treating  concerning  the  beginning  of  that  business,  the  salvation  of 
the  world,  for  which  My  Father  sent  Me.  Neither  must  you  suppose 
that  I shall  always  remain  with  you  ; some  day  I shall  leave  you  and 
go  away  about  this  business,  as  I have  already  begun  to  do.  And, 
as  for  My  going  without  your  knowledge,  I did  so  purposely,  to 
teach  you  that,  in  these  matters,  I depend  not  on  you,  but  on

S.  LUKE,  C.  II. 


My  Heavenly  Father,  and  that  I must  act  according  to  His  will 
and  His  plan.  It  is  not  I,  then,  who  have  given  you  cause  for 
sorrow,  but  partly  your  love  for  Me  and  partly  your  ignorance  of  the 
mystery  I have  now  told  you  of ; you  knew  not  that  I was  occupied 
with  My  Father’s  affairs.  For,  though  this  ought  to  have  presented 
itself  to  your  mind,  your  tender  love  prevented  it,  and  turned  aside 
the  thought  Hence  Bede  says,  “ He  blames  her  not  because  she 
sought  Him  as  her  son,  but  forces  her  to  raise  the  eyes  of  her  mind 
to  what  He  owes  Him  whose  Eternal  Son  He  is.” 

In  order  to  understand  this  thoroughly  we  must  notice  that  Christ, 
besides  His  Divine  actions,  which  He  had  as  God  and  the  Son  of 
God,  such  as  creating,  preserving,  and  ruling  all  things,  and  breath- 
ing the  Holy  Spirit,  had  human  actions  of  two  kinds.  Of  these  He 
had  some  as  man,  common  to  Him  with  other  men,  eating,  walking, 
labouring,  &c. ; others  were  proper  to  Him  as  the  God-Man,  the 
Redeemer,  the  Christ,  and  these  actions  are  called  by  S.  Dionysius 
“Theandric”  (Owe  awjf),  being  the  works  partly  of  God  and  partly 
of  a man.  Such  actions  were  those  of  teaching,  working  miracles, 
calling  His  disciples,  creating  and  ordaining  apostles,  &c. 

In  respect  of  the  former  class  of  actions  Christ  wa6  willing  to 
obey  His  parents ; but  as  to  the  latter  He  would  obey  only  God 
His  Father,  because  these,  as  being  of  a higher  order,  were  received 
by  and  were  under  the  direction  of  God  alone.  Wherefore  He 
answered  His  parents,  when  they  sought  an  explanation  of  His 
conduct,  that  these  things  were  to  be  done,  not  at  their  will 
and  pleasure,  but  at  God’s — as  appears  from  this  passage,  and 
at  the  marriage  at  Cana,  in  the  turning  of  the  water  into  wine, 
S.  John  ii  4,  and  in  other  similar  cases. 

And  these  actions  which  Christ  did  as  the  God-Man  He  calls  the 
actions  of  God  His  Father,  and  attributes  to  His  Father,  not  to 
Himself  (1)  because  on  account  of  these  works  He  was  sent  by 
His  Father  into  the  world;  (2)  because  He  had  His  Divinity  from 
the  Father,  and  these  were  the  works  chiefly  of  His  Divinity; 
(3)  because  He  did  them  by  the  Father’s  command ; (4)  because 
in  these  matters  He  was  subject  to  no  one  but  His  Eternal  Father,

to  teach  us  that  God’s  command  or  counsel  must  come  before 
even  the  tenderest  love  for  a mother — as  when  God  calls  any  one 
to  religion,  to  the  priesthood,  to  martyrdom,  or  to  the  apostolate, 
and  his  parents  are  opposed  to  the  call. 

Ver.  5a — And  they  understood  not  the  saying  which  He  spake  a into 
them.  Some  make  these  words  refer  to  the  ignorance  of  those  who 
stood  by,  who  were  astonished  at  the  wisdom  and  the  answers  of 
Jesus— others  to  Joseph  alone  by  a synecdoche.  But  they  clearly 
refer  both  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  and  Joseph ; few,  though  they  knew 
that  their  Jesus  was  Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  and  the  Saviour  of  die 
world,  still  they  did  not  understand  in  what  manner  He  was  going 
to  set  about  the  work  of  this  His  office,  or  what  was  that  business 
of  His  Father  which  He  had  said  that  it  behoved  Him  to  be  about 
— that  is  to  say,  whether,  or  when,  or  how  He  was  going  to  teach, 
to  live,  to  die,  and  to  be  crucified  for  the  salvation  of  the  world ; 
for  these  things  had  not  yet  been  revealed  to  them  by  God.  How- 
ever, they  learnt  all  this  in  progress  of  time,  either  by  experience 
or  by  revelation  from  Jesus.  And,  out  of  reverence  for  Him,  they 
durst  not  ask  Him  curiously  in  this  place  what  those  mysteries 
were,  but  prudently  awaited  the  fitting  opportunity. 

Ver.  51. — And  He  went  down  with  them , and  came  to  Nazareth; 
and  was  subject  unto  them . He  “ came  to  Nazareth  ” of  His  own 
accord,  notwithstanding  that  S.  Bernard  says  (Serm.  19  in  Cant.\ 
“ Having  remained  in  Jerusalem,  and  having  told  them  that  He 
must  needs  be  engaged  in  what  belonged  to  His  Father,  He 
yet  did  not  disdain  to  follow  them  to  Nazareth — the  Master — the 
disciples — God — Men,  the  Word  and  Wisdom, — a carpenter  and 
a woman.” 

Subject '.  In  the  Greek  broxil/u*{,  obedient , that  is,  as  regards 
His  human  nature,  not  as  regards  His  Divine  nature,  as  S.  Augustine 
shows,  in  opposition  to  the  Arians  ( Contra  Haximinum,  lib.  iii. 
cap.  xviiL) 

Observe  that  the  human  nature  in  Christ,  though  considered  in 
itself,  it  was  under  the  rule  of  His  mother,  yet,  being  elevated  by 
God  to  the  Person  [Hypostasis]  of  the  Word,  and  being,  therefore,

one  with  God — one  Divine  Person — was,  for  this  reason,  exempt 
from  the  obligation  of  obedience  to  His  mother  as  much  as  from 
that  of  obedience  to  the  laws  of  Augustus  and  all  other  worldly 
authorities.  Just  as  a member  of  a religious  order,  if  he  be  made 
Pope,  is  exempted  from  the  obedience  of  his  order,  and,  indeed, 
becomes  its  superior.  Yet  Christ,  to  give  us  an  example  of  pro- 
found humility  and  perfect  obedience,  made  Himself  subject  to  His 
mother,  and  to  Joseph  too. 

Let  children  learn,  says  S.  Augustine  (&m  63  De  Diversis), 
to  be  subordinate  to  their  parents,  because  the  world  is  subject  to 
Christ,  and  yet  Christ  was  subject  to  His  parents.  And  S.  Bernard 
(Serm.  1 on  the  text  “ missus  est  ”)  exclaims,  “ He  was  subject  to 
them.  Who?  To  whom?  God  to  men,  not  only  to  Mary,  but 
also  to  Joseph.  On  both  sides  an  astounding  thing!  On  both 
sides  a marvel ! both  that  God  obeys  a woman — humility  without 
example ! and  that  a woman  rules  over  God— exaltation  without  a 
parallel!  . . . Blush,  proud  dust  and  ashes  (cinis)\  God  humbles 
Himself,  and  dost  thou  lift  thyself  up  ? ...  As  often  as  I desire  to 
rule  over  men  so  often  do  I strive  to  surpass  my  God.” 

Christ  wished  to  teach  us  by  the  whole  of  His  early  life,  for  thirty 
years  without  cessation,  that  the  perfection  of  virtue,  and  especially 
of  religious  life,  consists  in  obedience.  He  did  and  said  many 
things  in  these  thirty  years,  but  S.  Luke  sums  them  all  up  in  the 
sentence,  “He  was  subject  to  them.”  Glorious  panegyric  of  a 
religious  man  1 All  His  life  He  was  obedient  and  subject  to  His 
superiors. 

It  is  the  opinion  of  the  old  writers  that  Christ  assisted  Joseph  in 
his  trade  as  a carpenter.  For  it  was  fitting  that  He,  who,  together 
with  His  true  Father,  is  the  Artificer  of  the  Universe,  should  practise 
with  His  supposed  father  the  trade  of  an  artificer. 

These  scanty  facts  only  does  S.  Luke  recount  of  the  youth  of  Christ 
until  His  thirtieth  year ; and  during  the  whole  of  this  time  He  lived 
privately  and  unknown.  The  statements  from  the  apocryphal  book, 
called  “The  Infancy  of  the  Saviour,”  and  other  books  of  the  same 
kind,  the  Church  rejects.

CHRIST  AS  A CARPENTER. 


137 


S.  Justin  (Dial,  contra  Tryphonem)  says  that  Christ  used  to 
make  ploughs,  yokes,  &c.,  and  that  for  this  reason  He  often  took 
them  as  figures  of  speech  in  the  Gospel,  as,  “Take  My  yoke  upon 
you,”  and  “ No  man  putting  his  hand  to  the  plough,  and  looking 
back,  is  fit  for  the  kingdom  of  God.”  Lyranus,  Jan senius,  Mal- 
donatus,  Dionysius  the  Carthusian,  and  John  of  Avila  are  of  the 
same  opinion,  as  also  Cajetan,  and  Francis  Lucas  (on  S.  Mark  vL  3) ; 
but  Paulus  Burgensis,  Baradius,  and  Simon  de  Cassia  (book  iv. 
ch.  3)  deny  that  Christ  worked  as  a carpenter,  and  hold  that  He 
lived  a retired  life  like  a religious  until  His  thirtieth  year,  passing 
His  time  in  prayer,  contemplation,  and  fasting.  To  the  objection 
that  the  Nazarenes,  who  were  neighbours  of  Jesus,  asked,  “ Is  not 
this  the  carpenter  ? 11  they  find  an  answer  in  S.  Augustine  (De  Cons. 
Evang .,  L ii.  c.  xlii.),  “They  thought  Him  a carpenter  because 
He  was  a carpenter’s  son,”  S.  Matt,  xiii.  55.  But  since  the 
Nazarenes  saw  Jesus  every  day,  and  studiously  watched  what  He 
did,  they  seem  likely  to  have  called  Him  a carpenter  from  His 
occupation.  Otherwise,  indeed,  had  they  seen  Him  idle,  they 
would  have  taxed  Him  with  idleness,  for  not  succouring  the  poverty 
of  His  parents  by  His  labour,  and  helping  His  father  Joseph  in 
his  work. 

Besides  Christ  wished  by  this  labour  to  give  an  example  to 
working-men.  So  S.  Paul  was  a tent-maker,  even  when  he  preached, 
as  appears  from  Acts  xviii.  3. 

But  His  mother  kept  all  these  sayings  in  her  heart — that,  in  course 
of  time,  she  might  the  more  fully  understand  all  that  Christ  should 
say  and  do,  and  also  that  she  might  impart  them  to  S.  Luke  and 
the  other  Apostles,  to  be  written  or  handed  down  to  posterity. 
“ For  although,”  says  Titus,  “ she  did  not  perfecdy  follow  all  that 
was  said  by  Him,  yet  she  understood  them  to  be  Divine  things,  and 
above  human  understanding.  She  heard  Jesus,  not  as  a child  of 
twelve  years,  but  received  and  heeded  His  words  as  those  of  a man 
perfect  in  every  way.”  Or,  as  Euthymius  says,  “ as  the  words  not 
merely  of  a child,  but  also  of  the  Son  of  God.” 

Ver.  52. — And  Jesus  increased  in  wisdom  and  stature , and  in

138 

favour  with  God  and  man.  For  stature  the  Greek  has  i X/x/qp,  “age? 
or  “ proficiency .”  See  also  chap.  xii.  25.  Both  renderings  are  true 
and  apposite. 

To  the  question  whether  Jesus  really  progressed  in  wisdom  and 
grace,  as  He  did  in  age  and  stature,  S.  Athanasius  ( Semu  4 Contra 
Arianos)  and  S.  Cyril  ( Thesaurus , L x.)  seem  to  answer  in  the 
affirmative ; for  they  seem  to  say  that  the  humanity  of  Christ  drew 
greater  wisdom  from  the  Word  by  degrees,  just  as  the  Blessed 
Virgin  and  other  men  and  women  did. 

But  the  rest  of  the  fathers  teach  differently.  For,  from  the  first 
instant  of  His  conception,  Jesus  was,  as  has  been  said  at  v.  40, 
full  of  wisdom  and  grace,  this  being  due  to  that  humanity  on 
account  of  its  hypostatic  union  with  the  Word.  S.  Gregory 
Nazianzen  (Oral.  20  in  laudem  Basilit)  says,  “He  progressed  in 
wisdom  before  God  and  men,  not  that  He  received  any  increase, 
since  He  was,  from  the  beginning,  absolute  in  grace  and  wisdom, 
but  these  gradually  became  apparent  to  men  [hitherto]  unaware  of 
them.”  For,  as  Theophylact  says,  " the  shining  forth  of  His  wisdom 
is  this  very  progress ; ” just  as  the  sun,  though  it  always  gives  the 
same  degree  of  light,  yet  is  said  to  increase  in  light  as  it  unfolds  it 
more  and  more  from  morning  until  midday.  It  is  to  be  noted  that 
there  were  in  the  soul  of  Christ  three  kinds  of  knowledge — 
(1)  beatific,  by  which  He  saw  God,  and  all  things  in  God,  and  so 
was  rendered  blessed ; (2)  knowledge  infused  by  God ; (3)  experi- 
mental knowledge  guided  by  daily  use.  The  two  former  were 
implanted  in  Christ  in  so  perfect  a degree  from  the  first  moment 
of  His  conception  that  He  could  not  increase  them.  I assert  the 
same  with  respect  to  His  habitual  grace  and  glory.  So  say  S. 
Augustine  (De  peccat.  mor.  et  rem .,  L iil  c.  xxix.),  S.  Jerome  (on 
the  words  of  Jer.  xxxi.  22,  “A  woman  shall  compass  a man”), 
S.  Athanasius,  Cyril,  S.  Gregory  Nazianzen,  Bede,  and  others, 
S.  Thomas  and  the  schoolmen  everywhere — for  this  is  required 
by  the  hypostatic  union. 

Christ,  therefore,  is  said  to  have  progressed  in  wisdom  and  grace 
as  He  progressed  in  years — 1.  In  the  estimation  of  men,  and  in

THE  GRACE  OF  CHRIST.

outward  seeming.  For  sometimes  Scripture  speaks  according  to 
what  is  seen  outwardly,  and  the  judgment  formed  by  men.  So 
Origen,  Theophylact,  Nazianzen,  S.  Athanasius,  and  Cyril. 

2.  Christ  did  really  increase  in  experimental  wisdom,  for  from 
mere  use  He  acquired  experience — “ He  learned  obedience  by  the 
things  which  He  suffered  ” Heb.  v.  8. 

3.  Though  Christ  did  not  increase  in  habitual,  yet  He  did 
increase  in  actual  and  practical  wisdom  and  grace.  For,  even 
while  yet  a child,  He  daily  exerted  more  and  more  of  the 
strength  of  mind  and  heavenly  wisdom  that  lay  hidden  in  His 
soul;  so  that  in  face  and  manner,  in  word  and  deed,  He  ever 
acted  with  greater  and  greater  modesty,  gravity,  prudence,  sweet- 
ness, and  piety. 

To  the  objection  that  Christ  is  said  to  have  increased  in  grace 
before  God,  S.  Thomas  (p.  iiL  Quaes t.  vii.),  answers  that  Christ 
increased  in  grace  in  Himself  not  as  regards  the  habit,  but  as 
regards  the  acts  and  effects  produced  by  it. 

Among  other  differences  between  the  grace  which  Christ  had, 
and  that  which  we  have,  there  are  the  four  following  : — 

1.  Christ  had  grace,  as  it  were,  naturally  by  virtue  both  of  the 
hypostatic  union  and  of  His  conception  of  the  Holy  Ghost;  but 
with  us  all  grace  is  undue,  gratuitous,  adventitious,  and  supernatural 

2.  In  us  grace  (1)  wipes  out  original  sin,  and  whatever  actual 
sins  there  may  be,  and  so  (2)  makes  us  pleasing  to  God ; but  in 
Christ  grace  existed  not  only  previously  to  sin,  but  actually  without 
it,  sanctifying  Him  per  Se  primo , for  from  the  grace  of  the  union 
with  the  Word  emanated  habitual  grace,  as  rays  from  the  sun, 
immediately  and  naturally.  So  that  we  are  adopted  and  are 
called  sons  of  God,  but  Christ  is  truly  and  naturally  the  Son  of 
God,  as  S.  Hilary  (De  Trinit .,  L xii.),  and  Cyril  (In  Joannem , 
l iii.  c.  xii),  teach. 

3.  In  us  grace  is  peculiar  to  the  individual,  justifying  the  man 
in  whom  it  resides;  but  the  grace  of  Christ  is  the  grace  of  the 
Head,  and  so  sanctifying  us.  For  “ of  His  fulness  have  we  all 
received,  and  grace  for  grace”  S.  John  i.  16.

S.  LUKE,  C.  IL 


4.  Grace  increases  in  us  (even  in  the  case  of  the  Blessed  Virgin) 
by  good  works;  but  in  Christ  it  did  not  increase,  because,  pro- 
ceeding from  the  union  with  the  Word,  which  from  the  beginning 
was  full  and  perfect,  this  fulness  of  grace,  which  could  not  be 
increased,  was  given  Him  at  the  moment  of  that  union. 

Tropologically,  Damascene  (De  fide, , L iii  c.  xxii.)  says  that 
Christ  progresses  in  wisdom  and  grace,  not  in  Himself,  but  in  His 
members,  that  is,  in  Christians.  For  He  went  on  producing  greater 
acts  of  virtue  day  by  day  that  He  might  teach  us  to  do  the  same. 
All  our  life  is  without  ceasing  either  a progress  or  a falling  off; 
when  it  is  not  becoming  better  it  is  becoming  worse,  as  S.  Bernard 
tells  us.  Ep.  25. 

With  God  and  man . “ For,”  says  Theophylact,  “ it  behoves  us 

to  please  God  first  and  then  man.”  If  we  please  God  He  will 
make  us  pleasing  to  men.  It  is  not  enough  to  please  man,  for 
this  is  often  false  and  feigned,  nor  to  please  God  only,  for  this 
is  peculiar  to  oneself  and  unseen,  but  we  must  please  “God  and 
man,”  that  we  may  show  to  men  that  grace  by  which  we  are  pleasing 
to  God,  and  so  attract  them  to  it  “To  God,”  says  S.  Bernard, 
*we  owe  our  conscience,  to  our  neighbours  our  good  reputation.”

CHAPTER  III. 

I  The  preaching  and  baptism  of  John . 15  His  testimony  of  Christ.  JO  Herod 

imprisoneth  John . 21  Christ  baptized,  recerveth  testimony  from  heaven.  23  The 
age,  and  genealogy  of  Christ  from  Joseph  upwards. 

NOW  in  the  fifteenth  year  of  the  reign  of  Tiberias  Cesar,  Pontius  Pilate  being 
governor  of  Judea,  and  Herod  being  tetrarch  of  Galilee,  and  his  brother 
Philip  tetrarch  of  Ituroea  and  of  the  region  of  Trachonitis,  and  Lysanias  the  tetrarch 
of  Abilene, 

2  Annas  and  Caiaphas  being  the  high  priests,  the  word  of  God  came  onto  John 
the  son  of  Zach arias  in  the  wilderness. 

3  And  he  came  into  all  the  country  about  Jordan,  preaching  the  baptism  of 
repentance  for  the  remission  of  sins ; 

4  As  it  is  written  in  the  book  of  the  words  of  Esaias  the  prophet,  saying,  The 
voice  of  one  crying  in  the  wilderness,  Prepare  ye  the  way  of  the  Lord,  make  his 
paths  straight. 

5  Every  valley  shall  be  filled,  and  every  mountain  and  hill  shall  be  brought 
low ; and  the  crooked  shall  be  made  straight,  and  the  rough  ways  shall  be  made 
smooth ; 

6  And  all  flesh  shall  see  the  salvation  of  God. 

7  Then  said  he  to  the  multitude  that  came  forth  to  be  baptized  of  him,  O genera* 
tion  of  vi peril,  who  hath  warned  you  to  flee  from  the  wrath  to  come  ? 

8  Bring  forth  therefore  fruits  worthy  of  repentance,  and  begin  not  to  say  within 
yourselves,  We  have  Abraham  to  our  father : for  I say  unto  you,  That  God  is  able 
of  these  stones  to  raise  up  children  unto  Abraham. 

9  And  now  also  the  axe  is  laid  unto  the  root  of  the  trees : every  tree  therefore 
which  bringeth  not  forth  good  fruit  is  hewn  down,  and  cast  into  the  fire. 

10  And  the  people  asked  him,  saying,  What  shall  we  do  then  ? 

II  He  answereth  and  saith  unto  them,  He  that  hath  two  coats,  let  him  impart 
to  him  that  hath  none ; and  he  that  hath  meat,  let  him  do  likewise. 

12  Then  came  also  publicans  to  be  baptized,  and  said  unto  him,  Master,  what 
shall  we  do? 

13  And  he  said  unto  them,  Exact  no  more  than  that  which  is  appointed  you. 

14  And  the  soldiers  likewise  demanded  of  him,  saying,  And  what  shall  we  do? 
And  he  said  unto  them,  Do  violence  to  no  man,  neither  accuse  any  falsely ; and 
be  content  with  your  wages. 

15  And  as  the  people  were  in  expectation,  and  all  men  mused  in  their  hearts  of 
John,  whether  he  were  the  Christ,  or  not ; 

16  John  answered,  saying  unto  them  all,  I indeed  baptize  you  with  water ; but

one  mightier  than  I cometh,  the  latchet  of  whose  shoes  I am  not  worthy  to  un- 
loose : he  shall  baptize  you  with  the  Holy  Ghost  and  with  fire : 

17  Whose  fan  is  in  his  hand,  and  he  will  thoroughly  purge  his  floor,  and  will 
gather  the  wheat  into  his  gamer  ; but  the  chaff  he  will  bum  with  fire  unquenchable. 

18  And  many  other  things  in  his  exhortation  preached  he  unto  the  people. 

19  But  Herod  the  tetrarch,  being  reproved  by  him  for  Herodias  his  brother 
Philip’s  wife,  and  for  all  the  evils  which  Herod  had  done, 

20  Added  yet  this  above  all,  that  he  shut  up  John  in  prison. 

21  Now  when  all  the  people  were  baptized,  it  came  to  pass,  that  Jesus  also 
being  baptized,  and  praying,  the  heaven  was  opened, 

23  And  the  Holy  Ghost  descended  in  a bodily  shape  like  a dove  upon  him 
and  a voice  came  from  heaven,  which  said,  Thou  art  my  beloved  Son  ; in  thee  X 
am  well  pleased. 

23  And  Jesus  himself  began  to  be  about  thirty  years  of  age,  being  (as  was  sup- 
posed) the  son  of  Joseph,  which  was  the  son  of  Heli, 

24  Which  was  the  son  of  Matthat,  which  was  the  son  of  Levi,  which  was  the  son

son  of  Cosam,  which  was  the  son  of  Elmodam,  which  was  the  son  of  Er, 

29  Which  was  the  son  of  Jose,  which  was  the  son  of  Eliezer,  which  was  the  son 
of  Jorim,  which  was  the  son  of  Matthat,  which  was  the  son  of  Levi, 

30  Which  was  the  son  of  Simeon,  which  was  the  son  of  Juda,  which  was  the  son 
of  Joseph,  which  was  the  son  of  Jonan,  which  was  the  son  of  Eliakim, 

31  Which  was  the  son  of  Melea,  which  was  the  son  of  Menan,  which  was  the 
son  of  Mattatha,  which  was  the  son  of  Nathan,  which  was  the  son  of  David, 

32  Which  was  the  son  of  Jesse,  which  was  the  son  of  Obed,  which  was  the  son 
of  Boo z,  which  was  the  son  of  Salmon,  which  was  the  son  of  Naasson,

of  Galilee,  and  his  brother  Philip  tetrarch  of  Iturcea  and  of  the  region 
of  Trachonitis,  and  Lysanias  the  tetrarch  of  Abilene, 

Ver.  2. — Annas  and  Caiaphas  being  the  high  priests , the  word  of 
God  came  unto  John  the  son  of  Zacharias  in  the  wilderness . 

S.  Luke  passes  from  the  twelfth  year  of  Christ  to  His  thirtieth, 
when,  after  the  manner  of  the  Hebrews,  He  began  to  discharge 
His  Office  of  Teacher  and  Redeemer  and  to  preach  publicly. 

In  the  fifteenth  year.  Augustus  reigned  for  fifty-seven  years  from 
the  death  of  Julius  Caesar,  and  died  on  the  19th  of  August;  so 
that  the  last  year  of  Augustus  was  not  a complete  year,  and,  con- 
sequently, the  first  of  Tiberius  only  consisted  of  five  months, 
from  August  to  January,  from  which  the  Romans  began  the  year. 
This  Tiberius,  having  heard  wonderful  things  through  Pilate  of 
the  miracles  and  the  sanctity  of  Christ,  wished  to  place  Him 
among  the  gods,  but  the  senate  opposed  him,  because  he  had 
attempted  to  do  it  without  consulting  them  (see  Commentary  on 
S.  Matt,  xxvii.  24). 

Pontius  Pilate  being  governor  of  Judcea.  Archelaus,  son  of  the 
Infanticide  Herod,  was  exiled  by  Augustus  for  his  tyrannical 
conduct  in  the  tenth  year  of  his  tetrarchy,  supposed  to  be  the 
fifty-second  of  Augustus  and  the  twelfth  of  the  life  of  Christ. 
Augustus  then  joined  Judaea  (that  is,  the  two  tribes  of  Judah  and 
Benjamin)  to  the  province  of  Syria,  the  governor  of  which  was  at 
the  time  Quirinus,  or,  as  S.  Luke  calls  him,  Cyrenius,  who  committed 
the  administration  of  Judaea  to  Coponius.  Hence  the  governors  of 
Judaea  were  called  procurators  or  administrators,  though  they  were 
really  governors.  Pilate  is  here  called  nytfjAnum*,  ruler  or  chief; 
and  the  Arabic  has  “in  the  dominion  over  Judaea  of  Pontius  Pilate.” 
Pilate  was  the  fifth  procurator  of  Judaea  in  succession  from 
Coponius;  he  ruled  nine  years,  in  the  second  of  which  Christ 
was  baptized,  and  in  the  fifth  was  crucified  by  him.  By  the 
vengeance  of  God  Pilate  was  exiled  by  Augustus  in  the  twenty- 
third  year  of  the  reign  of  the  latter. 

Herod  being  tetrarch  of  Galilee.  In  the  Arabic,  “ In  the  dominion 
of  Herod  the  ruler  over  the  fourth  of  Galilee,  and  of  Philip,  his

brother,  over  the  fourth  of  Ituraea.”  A tetrarch  is  one  who  governs 
the  fourth  part  of  a province  or  kingdom ; called  by  Theodoret  a 
“ Quadra  plans.” 

Herod  the  Infanticide,  dying  five  days  after  the  massacre  of  the 
innocents,  in  the  second  year  of  Christ,  left  three  sons,  Archelaus, 
Hercki  Antipas,  and  Philip  (for  he  had  put  the  rest  to  death— one  of 
them,  Antipater,  at  the  very  time  of  the  massacre  of  the  innocents). 
These  striving  together  about  the  succession  of  their  father,  Augustus 
divided  the  kingdom  into  four  parts,  or  tetrarchies ; he  gave  Judaea 
to  Archelaus  (and  after  his  expulsion  to  Coponius),  Galilee  to  Herod 
Antipas,  Ituraea  and  Trachonitis  to  Philip,  and  Abilene  to  Lysanias, 
a foreigner.  These  tetrarchies  were  of  great  size,  and  like  king- 
doms, as  Pliny  tells  us  (bk.  v.  18) ; and  so  Herod  Antipas,  although 
he  is  called  a tetrarch  by  S.  Matthew  (xiv.  i),  is  called  a king  by 
S.  Mark  (vl  14).  Indeed  Herod  Agrippa,  father  and  son,  the 
nephew  and  grand-nephew  of  Herod  Antipas,  being  son  and  grand- 
son of  his  brother  Aristobulus,  obtained  from  Caligula  and  from 
Claudius  the  title  of  king,  as  appears  from  Acts  xii.  1 and  xxv.  24. 

And  his  brother  Philip  tetrarch  of  Iturcea  and  the  region  of 
Trachonitis . Ituraea,  so  called  from  Iethur  or  Ithur,  the  son  of 
Ishmael,  is  a mountainous  and  woody  district  stretching  along  the 
base  of  the  Lebanon.  Trachon,  or  Trachonitis,  says  Pliny  (bk.  v. 
ch.  18),  is  a region  beyond  Jordan,  between  Palestine  and  Coelesyria, 
bounded  on  the  east  by  the  Arabian  desert,  and  on  the  north  by 
Damascus ; it  was  inhabited  by  half  the  tribe  of  Manasseh. 

And  Lysanias  the  tetrarch  of  Abilene.  Bede  and  Adrichomius 
think  that  this  Lysanias  was  a fourth  son  of  Herod  the  Infanticide. 
But  Josephus  says  that  he  was  the  son  of  another  Lysanias,  who 
was  the  elder  son  of  Ptolemy  Minnaeus,  who  ruled  in  Chalcis  close  by 
Mount  Lebanon,  and  that  he  succeeded  him  in  his  kingdom  before 
Herod  the  Infanticide  had  been  made  king  of  Judaea  by  the  Romans. 
The  elder  Lysanias  was  slain  by  Antony,  the  colleague  of  Augustus 
and  Lepidus  in  the  Triumvirate,  at  the  instigation  of  Cleopatra,  who 
was  scheming  to  add  his  kingdom  to  her  own  ancestral  kingdom  of 
Egypt.  This  happened  thirty  years  before  the  birth  of  Christ

LYSANIAS,  THE  TETRARCH  OF  ABILENE.  14$ 

Lysanias  the  younger  tried  to  reinstate  Antigonus  in  the  kingdom  of 
Judaea,  to  the  exclusion  of  Hyrcanus,  whom  Herod  the  Infanticide 
supported ; for  this  reason  Herod  was  created  King  of  Judaea  by  the 
Roman  Senate  at  the  instance  of  Antony  and  Augustus,  both 
Hyrcanus  and  Antigonus  being  excluded,  as  Josephus  relates  in 
bk.  Lch.11.  of  his  “ War ; ” and  the  same  author,  in  bk.  xix,  ch.  4 of 
his  u Antiquities,"  asserts  that  all  that  region  was  called  Lysania 
after  Lysanias. 

Abilene , Abila , Abyla , or  Abtla , is  a celebrated  town  of  Coelesyria 
situated  by  Mount  Lebanon,  and  from  it  the  region  of  Abilene,  or 
Abilina,  takes  its  name.  Abilene  borders  on  Damascus  towards  the 
east,  Chalcis  on  the  west,  and  the  Lebanon  on  the  south. 

S.  Luke  is  at  great  pains  to  enumerate  here  the  chief  personages, 
both  secular  and  ecclesiastic : — 

(1.)  To  mark  distinctly  and  palpably  the  time  and  year  when 
John,  and  then  Christ,  began  to  preach. 

(2.)  To  shew  that  the  sceptre  had  now  passed  from  Judah,  because 
Herod  and  his  sons  the  tetrarchs,  and  Tiberias  and  the  Romans  had 
become  the  rulers  of  Judaea,  and  that  therefore  the  Messiah,  the 
beginning  of  whose  preaching  he  relates  in  this  chapter,  had  come, 
according  to  the  prophecy  of  Jacob,  Gen.  xlix.  10. 

(3.)  To  give  us  to  understand  that  Israel,  tom  in  sunder  among  so 
many  rulers;  some  infidels,  others  impious  men,  had  need  of  the  advent 
of  the  Messiah,  Who  should  make  the  people  whole  and  save^  them. 

(4. ) Because  these  personages  had  much  to  do  with  those  works 
of  John  and  of  Christ  which  S.  Luke  will  afterwards  relate.  Tiberius, 
as  I have  said,  wished  to  number  Christ  among  the  gods ; Pilate 
crucified  Him  ; Herod  Antipas  seized  upon  Herodias  the  wife  of  his 
brother  Philip,  and  being  reproved  by  John,  slew  him;  and  he  clothed 
Christ  in  a white  dress  and  mocked  Him  ; while  Annas  and  Caiaphas 
persecuted  Christ  to  death,  and  also  persecuted  the  Apostles  after 
His  death. 

Annas  and  Caiaphas  being  the  high  priests . There  was  but  one 
high  priest  of  the  Jews,  as  appears  from  Josephus  and  others ; why 

then  are  there  two  mentioned  here  ? My  answer  is  that  Caiaphas 

VOL.  VL  K

S.  LUKE,  C.  III. 


was  the  high  priest,  but  there  were  many  chief,  or  leading  priests, 
as  is  clear  from  Matt.  xxvi.  3,  and  the  chief  priests  are  repeatedly 
mentioned  in  the  Passion  of  Christ,  as  accusing  Him  before  Pilate, 
condemning  Him,  mocking  Him,  but  the  most  prominent  of  them 
were  Caiaphas  and  Annas,  the  former  as  being  high  priest,  the 
latter  as  father-in-law  of  Caiaphas,  and  as  having  been  high  priest, 
and  having  great  influence  among  the  Jews ; indeed,  Annas  had  five 
sons  who  were  high  priests  after  him  (Josephus,  “ Antiquities,"  bk. 
xx.  ch.  8). 

The  word  (that  is,  the  command)  of  God  came  unto  John  the 
son  of  Zacharias . In  the  fifteenth  year  of  Tiberius,  God  ordered 
John  the  Baptist  to  preach  and  baptize ; ordered  him  by  an  interior 
inspiration,  perhaps  too  by  the  voice  of  an  angel. 

Ver.  3. — And  he  came  into  all  the  country  about  Jordan , preaching 
the  baptism  of  repentance  (ue.,  stirring  them  up  to  do  penance)  for  the 
remission  of  sins — to  be  obtained  in  the  baptism  of  Christ  John 
was  preaching  penance,  that  by  it  they  might  dispose  themselves  for 
the  reception  of  pardon  and  grace  from  Christ  See  Matt.  iii. 

Ver.  4. — As  it  is  written  in  the  book  of  the  words  of  Esaias  the 
prophet , sayings  The  voice  cf  one  crying  in  the  wilderness , Prepare  ye 
the  way  of  the  Lord , make  His  paths  straight. 

Ver.  5. — Every  valley  shall  be  filled , and  every  mountain  and  hill 
shall  be  brought  low ; and  the  crooked  shall  be  made  straight , and 
the  rough  ways  shall  be  made  smooth.  S.  Gregory  (Horn.  xx. 
In  Evangelid ),  S.  Augustine,  S.  Chrysostom,  Bede,  and  others 
interpret  these  words  as  meaning,  Every  one  that  exalteth  himself 
shall  be  humbled,  and  he  that  humbleth  himself  shall  be  exalted, 
as  Christ  said.  This,  however,  is  a discourse  in  which  John  exhorts 
his  hearers  to  a change  of  life  and  conversation,  as  though  he  said, 
O ye  Jews,  prepare  the  way  for  Christ,  your  Messiah,  now  about 
to  come  to  you.  Wherefore,  “ Every  valley  shall  be  filled,”  *.&,  let  it 
be  filled  up,  “ and  every  mountain  and  hill  shall  be  brought  low,”  ie ., 
let  it  be  brought  low,  “and  the  crooked,”  ue .,  difficult  ways,  “ shall  be,” 
i.e .,  let  them  be  made,  “ into  straight,”  &c.  In  other  words,  smooth 
all  the  ways  for  Christ,  your  King,  Who  cometh,  as  is  wont  to  be

done  for  kings  that  are  about  to  enter  upon  their  kingdoms,  so  that 
the  rough  ways  be  made  smooth  and  level.  Remove  from  your 
minds  all  that  is  evil,  distorted,  or  unequal ; too  much  lifted  up,  or 
too  much  cast  down ; he  that  beareth  in  his  heart  the  mountain  of 
pride,  let  him  bring  down  this  swelling,  and  he  that  hath  in  him  the 
valley  of  pusillanimity  or  sloth,  let  him  lift  and  fill  it  up  with  gene- 
rosity and  confidence  in  God ; and  he  that  is  of  “ rough  ” behaviour, 
let  him  train  himself  to  suavity  and  modesty. 

And  all  flesh  shall  see  the  salvation  of  God — i.e.,  so  shall  it  come 
to  pass  that  every  man  shall  be  able  to  see  both  with  the  eyes  of 
the  body,  and  also  more  especially  with  those  of  the  soul,  “the 
salvation  of  God  n — the  Saviour  Christ — feel  and  experience  within 
himself  the  salvation  and  the  power  of  the  grace  brought  by  Christ 

S.  Gregory  {Horn.  20  In  Evang .)  says,  “Every  valley  shall  be 
filled  up,  because  the  humble  receive  a gift  which  the  hearts  of 
them  that  are  puffed  up  repel  from  them.  The  bad  places  are  made 
straight  when  the  hearts  of  the  wicked,  turned  awry  by  iniquity,  are 
directed  by  the  rule  of  justice;  and  the  rough  places  are  turned 
into  smooth  ways  when  haughty  and  angry  minds  return  to  the 
gentleness  of  meekness  by  the  infusion  of  heavenly  grace.” 

The  verses  from  7 to  10  have  been  explained  in  the  Commentary 
on  S.  Matthew  iii.  7. 

Ver.  10. — And  the  people  asked  Him , saying, , What  shall  we  do  then  t 
that  we  may  bear  fruits  worthy  of  penance,  and  so  avoid  the  ruin 
threatened  by  you,  and  obtain  everlasting  salvation.  John  had 
accused  the  Pharisees  and  the  populace,  but  the  Pharisees  “ despised 
the  counsel  of  God,”  c.  vii.  30,  and  therefore  also  the  discourse 
of  John ; but  the  crowd  of  common  people,  deeply  moved  and 
touched  by  the  force  of  his  preaching,  try  to  find  out  the  way  to 
repent,  so  as  to  seize  upon  John’s  instructions,  and  offer  themselves 
to  him  ready  and  prepared.  So  also,  in  these  days,  the  common 
people  were  more  ready  than  the  great  to  take  hold  of  the  warnings 
of  preachers,  and  are  therefore  saved  rather  than  they. 

Ver.  1 1. — Heanswereth  and  saith  unto  them,  He  that  hath  two  coats , 
let  him  impart  to  him  that  hath  none  ; and  he  that  hath  meat , let  him

do  likewise.  A synecdoche ; he  signifies  every  kind  of  alms-deed  by 
one  which  is  the  more  common  and  necessary ; clothing  and  feeding 
the  poor.  “ Two?  supposing  one  coat  to  be  sufficient  to  clothe  and 
warm  the  body,  and  the  other,  therefore,  superfluous,  let  him  give 
that  other  " to  him  that  hath  not,”  to  him  that  is  naked  and  in  need

to  the  poor  man.  So  S.  Jerome  (Quasi.  I.  ad  Hedibiam ) \ and 
S.  Ambrose,  on  this  passage,  says,  “ The  limits  of  mercy  are  observed 
according  to  the  capability  of  human  nature,  so  that  each  one 
deprive  not  himself  of  everything,  but  share  what  he  has  with  the  poor 
man,”  and  he  adds,  “ He  that  is  able,  let  him  bear  the  fruit  of  grace, 
he  that  is  bound,  of  penance.  The  use  of  mercy  is  common,  there- 
fore the  precept  is  common ; mercy  is  the  fulness  of  the  virtues.” 

This,  then,  is  one  of  the  fruits  worthy  of  penance,  according  to  the 
words  of  Daniel  to  Nebuchadnezzar,  “ Break  off  thy  sins  by  righte- 
ousness and  thine  iniquities  by  showing  mercy  to  the  poor”  iv.  27. 
Besides,  almsgiving  fitly  disposes  our  lives  for  every  virtue.  Every 
virtue  is  either  of  obligation  or  of  supererogation ; justice  is  of  obli- 
gation, mercy  of  supererogation,  and  therefore  mercy  satisfies  both 
for  itself  and  for  justice,  both  because  he  that  gives  what  is  his  own, 
will  not  seize  what  belongs  to  others,  and  also  because  he  that  gives 
what  he  is  not  bound  to  give  will  much  more  pay  what  he  owes — 
to  which  he  is  bound  by  justice  or  some  other  virtue — and  again 
because  mercy  comes  of  love  and  charity,  and  charity  is  the  fulness 
of  the  law.  For  “ He  that  loveth  hath  fulfilled  the  law,”  Rom.  xiii. 

Euthymius  aptly  remarks  here,  “ He  enjoins  on  the  multitudes  to 
take  one  another  into  mutual  benevolence,  and  assist  one  another 
with  mutual  good  works.”  For  the  many  easily  understand  works 
of  mercy,  and  devote  themselves  to  them,  while  they  are  not  easily 
induced  to  prayer,  fasting,  and  works  of  penance,  and  sometimes 
are  incapable  of  them. 

Ver.  12. — Then  came  also  publicans  to  be  baptized , and  said 
unto  him , Master , what  shall  we  do  f — to  save  our  souls.  Here  is 
fulfilled  the  saying  of  Christ,  “ Publicans  and  harlots  shall  be  before 
you  (O  Scribes)  in  the  kingdom  of  God,”  Matt.  xxL  31.  For  the

sinner*?,  being  called  to  account  by  John,  felt  deep  compunction, 
acknowledged  their  fault,  and  sought  for  penance;  but  the  proud 
Scribes,  thinking  themselves  just  and  wise,  despised  it 

Ver.  13. — And  he  said  unto  them%  Exact  no  more  than  that  which 
is  appointed  you — in  the  exaction  of  taxes.  In  the  Greek  it  is 
rpfartn,  which  can  be  translated  both  make  and  exact , but  in  this 
place  is  more  clearly  rendered  exact  as  the  Syriac  and  the  Greek 
render  it  So  Jansenius,  Maldonatus,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others. 
For  tax-gatherers  are  wont  to  increase  the  tribute  out  of  avarice, 
and  to  exact  more  than  is  appointed  by  the  Ruler,  which  is  theft  or 
rapine,  wherefore  John  here  charges  them  with  it  “He  lays  a 
moderate  command  on  them,”  says  S.  Augustine  (Serin.  3 de 
Diversis ),  “ that  both  iniquity  may  have  no  place,  and  the  appointed 
tribute  may  have  effect”  “So  the  Baptist,”  says  S.  Ambrose, 
“gives  to  each  generation  of  men  the  answer  suitable  to  them.” 
Let  the  preacher  do  the  same,  and  prescribe  to  wives,  to  husbands, 
to  sons,  to  maidservants,  to  menservants,  to  merchants,  farmers, 
and  lawyers,  what  each  in  particular  onght  to  do,  and  give  each 
one  the  directions  proper  to  his  state  of  life.” 

Ver.  14. — And  the  soldiers  likewise  demanded  of  him,  saying  And 
what  shall  we  do  t And  he  said  unto  them,  Do  violence  to  no  man , 
neither  accuse  any  falsely  ; and  be  content  with  your  wages . Soldiers 
who  were  serving  some  of  them  under  Herod  Antipas  against 
Aretas,  the  king  of  the  Arabs,  some  under  the  prefect  of  the 
Temple,  and  some  under  Pilate,  the  Roman  Governor ; these  men, 
hearing  John  thundering  against  their  vices,  and  threatening  them 
with  hell,  conscious  of  rapine  and  other  crimes,  which  soldiers  are 
wont  to  commit,  becoming,  together  with  the  publicans,  contrite,  at 
the  word  of  John,  seek  from  him  the  remedy  of  penance,  of  a good 
life,  and  of  salvation.  John,  therefore,  tacitly  gives  it  to  be  under- 
stood that  it  is  lawful  to  be  a soldier,  and  that  war  is  lawful,  as  S. 
Ambrose  teaches  ( Serm.  7),  and  S.  Augustine  ( Contra  Faustum , 
bk.  xxil  ch.  lxxiv.) 

Ver.  15. — And  as  the  people  were  in  expectation  (in  the  Greek 
fr£otfdoxoC*’f?,  suspecting,  expecting,  as  Vatablus  renders  it — when

the  people  were  hoping,  or  were  in  suspense  with  hope,  desire, 
and  expectation),  and  all  men  mused  in  their  hearts  of  John , whether 
he  were  the  Christy  or  not — the  Messiah  promised  to  the  fathers, 
and  so  eagerly  expected  by  all  the  Jews  at  this  particular  time 
when  the  sceptre  had  passed  from  Judah,  and  Daniel’s  seventy 
weeks,  the  sign  of  Christ’s  coming,  were  fulfilled.  As  the  people, 
then,  were  spreading  this  report  about  John,  the  chief  men  of  the 
Jews  at  length  sent  messengers  to  him  to  ask  him  whether  he 
were  Christ  (John  i.  19).  Such  was  the  holiness  of  John.  So  S. 
Ambrose,  Bede,  and  others  explain. 

Ver.  16.— John  answered \ saying  unto  them  ally  I indeed  baptize 
you  with  watery  but  one  mightier  than  I cometh — namely,  the  Messias. 

The  rest  which  Luke  here  adds  has  been  explained  on  Matt, 
iii.  11. 

Morally,  Origen  says,  “ Preachers  are  here  warned  not  to 
allow  themselves  to  be  too  much  praised  or  honoured  by  the  people, 
but  to  suppress  these  praises  and  honours,  and  refer  them  to  Christ, 
lest  by  reason  of  their  pride  they  be  deprived  of  them  by  Christ 

Ver.  23. — And  Jesus  Himself  began  to  be  about  thirty  years  old 
“ Beginning  ” refers  not  to  “ thirty  years,”  for  then  “ about  ” would 
be  redundant,  but  to  the  public  preaching  of  Jesus,  for  which  He 
was  sent  by  the  Father.  Having  been  declared  in  His  baptism 
the  Messiah,  the  Teacher,  Lawgiver,  and  Saviour  of  the  world  by 
the  Dove  and  by  the  voice  of  the  Father,  and  when  He  was 
therefore  beginning  to  exercise  this  His  function,  and  to  teach  the 
Gospel  law  and  preach  publicly,  Jesus  “was  about  thirty  years  old.” 
This  is  plain  from  the  Greek,  which  has,  “And  Jesus  was  about 
thirty  years  beginning,”  i.e.y  when  He  began  to  preach.  So  Jan- 
senius,  Baronius,  and  others. 

Observe  the  “about /”  he  does  not  state  definitely  whether  Jesus 
was  exactly  thirty.  If  we  suppose  Him  to  have  been  born  in  the 
forty-second  year  of  Augustus,  Jesus  was,  in  this  year  of  His  bap- 
tism— the  fifteenth  ot  Tiberius— completing  His  twenty-ninth  year 
and  beginning  His  thirtieth.  But  if  He  were  born  in  the  forty-first 
of  Augustus  He  was  now  completing  His  thirtieth  year.

HELI  AND  JACOB. 


151 

Thirty  years.  John,  and  a little  after  him,  Christ,  began  to  preach 
not  too  soon,  but  at  a proper  age.  The  Hebrews  have  the  tradition 
that  no  one  was  allowed  to  teach  publicly  before  his  thirtieth  year, 
for  at  that  age  a man  is  in  his  full  vigour,  and  his  judgment  fully 
matured  and  perfected.  This  we  also  gather  from  1 Chron.  xxiii.  3. 

As  was  supposed,  the  son  of  Joseph,  which  was  (here,  and  before 
each  of  the  following  names  the  Arabic  puts  in  “the  son”)  of  Heli, 
which  was  of  Mathat.  From  this  passage  Porphyry  and  Julian 
the  Apostate  accused  Luke  of  being  incorrect,  because  Joseph  was 
not  the  son  of  Heli,  but  of  Jacob,  as  S.  Matthew  says  (ch.  i) ; and 
because  S.  Luke  gives  the  other  progenitors  of  Joseph  and  Heli 
names  entirely  different  from  those  given  them  by  S.  Matthew. 

Besides,  Jesus  was  not  the  son  of  Joseph,  but  bom  of  the  Virgin 
Mary. 

The  solution  given  by  some  to  this  difficulty  is  that  Joseph  was 
by  nature  the  son  of  Jacob,  but  by  law  the  son  of  Hell  By  the  old 
law  (Deut  xxv.  5)  a surviving  brother  had  to  raise  up  seed  to  his 
dead  brother,  and  the  brother  who  had  died  childless  was  held  to 
be  the  legal  father  of  these  sons.  Now  Jesca,  says  Euthymius, 
married  Mathat,  and  by  him  had  Heli,  then  she  married  Mathan, 
and  by  him  had  Jacob.  Heli  died  without  issue,  and  his  brother 
Jacob  married  his  wife  in  accordance  with  the  law,  and  Joseph  was 
his  son  by  her,  being,  therefore,  naturally  the  son  of  Jacob,  but 
legally  of  Heli.  So  Justinus,  S.  Jerome,  Eusebius,  Nasianzen,  and 
S.  Ambrose  explain  it  But,  on  the  other  hand,  Heli  and  Jacob 
were  only  uterine  brothers,  and  the  law  on  the  subject  of  raising 
up  seed  to  a brother  only  applies  to  full  brothers,  sons  of  the  same 
father;  for  they  alone  kept  the  name  and  heritage  of  the  father, 
Besides,  the  introduction  of  Jesca  is  beside  the  point  For  though 
her  sons,  Heli  and  Jacob,  be  connected  through  her,  yet  they  would 
have  no  connection  through  Mathat  and  Mathan  and  the  rest  of 
their  ancestors  up  to  David. 

This,  therefore,  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  pedigree  of  the  Blessed 
Virgin  and  Christ,  in  so  far  as  showing  Jesus  to  be  of  the  seed 
of  David  according  to  the  flesh  is  concerned.  For  if  Jesus  be

descended  from  Jesca  and  Mathat,  He  could  not  be  also  descended 
from  Jesca  and  Mathan  ; how,  then,  is  He  set  down  as  the  descend- 
ant of  both  Mathan  and  Mathat  ? 

My  opinion  is  that  hi  the  time  of  Christ  it  was  very  well  known 
that  Mathan  was  the  common  grandfather  of  Joseph  and  the 
Blessed  Virgin ; and  that  Jacob,  the  father  of  Joseph,  and  Heli,  or 
Joachim,  the  father  of  the  Blessed  Virgin,  were  full  brothers — as 
Francis  Lucas  holds — or  rather,  that  Jacob  was  the  brother  of  S. 
Anne,  the  wife  of  Heli,  or  Joachim,  and  mother  of  the  Blessed 
Virgin ; hence  the  genealogy  of  one  is  the  genealogy  of  the  other. 
For  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  descended,  through  her  mother,  from 
Jacob,  Mathan,  and  Solomon,  and,  through  her  father,  Joachim  or 
Heli,  from  Mathat  and  Nathan. 

So  S.  Matthew  gives  the  genealogy  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  through 
her  mothers.  Anne,  while  S.  Luke  gives  it  through  her  father  Heli,  or 
Joachim,  so  that  Christ  may  be  shown  to  be  descended  of  the  seed 
of  David  in  both  ways. 

There  is  no  other  better  way  than  this  pf  reconciling  the  genea- 
logies given  by  SS.  Matthew  and  Luke.  Moreover,  it  is  the  common 
opinion  of  S.  Augustine,  Denis  the  Carthusian,  Cajetan,  Jansenius, 
and  other  doctors  whom  Suarez  quotes  (pt  iii.,  quaest  xxvii.  a.  i, 
disp.  3,  sect  a)  that  S.  Luke  traces  the  genealogy  of  Christ  through 
Heli,  or  Joachim,  the  father  of  the  Blessed  Virgin.  Hence  it  must 
follow  that  S.  Matthew's  genealogy  is  traced  through  S.  Anne,  and 
that  she  was  the  daughter  of  Mathan ; for  otherwise  all  her 
ancestors,  whom  S.  Matthew  recounts,  belong  only  to  Joseph,  and 
not  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  and  Christ. 

S.  Matthew  then  traces  Christ's  descent  through  His  father  Joseph, 
S.  Luke  through  His  mother,  the  Blessed  Virgin ; both  lines  are 
united  in  David,  but  after  him  separate  through  his  two  sons 
Solomon  and  Nathan.  And  again  these  two  lines  of  Nathan  and 
of  Solomon  unite  in  S.  Anne,  the  daughter  of  Mathan,  and  sister 
of  Jacob,  Joseph's  father.

the  descent  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  and  Christ  according  to  the  flesh, 
and  this  is  the  end  and  aim  of  each  genealogy — so  says  S.  Augustine 
(or  whoever  is  the  author  of  the  Quasi.  vetcris  et  ttovi  Testament 
bk.  i.  q.  lvi.,  and  bk.  ii.  q.  vi). 

Ver.  24. — Which  was  the  son  of  Janna — Janneus,  the  second 
Hyrcanus,  if  we  are  to  believe  Annius  and  Philo,  who  was  the  last 
leader  of  the  Jews  of  the  line  of  David,  and  was  of  the  stock  of  the 
Asmonaei,  or  Maccabees;  Josephus  mentions  him  in  bk.  xii.  ch. 
iv.  and  v.,  and  Eusebius  in  his  Chronicle.  For  Christ  was  descended 
both  from  high  priests,  such  as  Judas,  Jonathas,  and  Simon 
Maccabaeus,  and  from  kings,  He  being  King  and  High  Priest,  as 
S.  Thomas,  and  Bonaventure  teach,  and  among  the  fathers, 
Nazianzen  and  Augustine,  whom  Suarez  (loo.  at.)  quotes  and 
follows.  The  Kings  of  Judah  used  to  take  as  their  wives  the 
daughters  of  the  high  priests. 

Ver.  27. — Which  was  the  son  of  Zorobobd,  which  was  the  Son  of 
Salathiel.  These  two  are  quite  distinct  from  the  Zorobabel  and 
Salathiel  mentioned  by  S.  Matthew  (ch.  L),  and  described  by  him  as 
descended  from  David  through  Solomon ; for  these  mentioned  by 
S.  Luke  descend  from  David  through  Nathan.  So  think  Pereira, 
Toletus,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others.  Perhaps  these  two  descendants 
of  Nathan,  being  raised  to  the  princely  dignity,  borrowed  the  names 
of  those  of  Solomon’s  family  who  were  illustrious  in  that  state. 

Ver.  31. — Which  was  the  son  of  Nathan,  which  was  the  son  of 
David.  Some  think  that  this  Nathan  was  the  prophet  who  repre- 
hended David  for  his  adultery  with  Bathsheba  (2  Kings  xii.  L) 
So  think  Origen,  N.  de  Lyra,  Burgensis,  Albertus  Magnus,  and  also 
S.  Augustine  (bk.  lxxxviii.  q.  bri).  But  S.  Augustine  (Retract, 
bk.  i.  ch.  xxvi.)  rightly  withdraws  this  theory,  for  this  Nathan 
was  bom  of  David  and  Bathsheba  when  they  were  joined  in  lawful 
marriage,  as  appears  from  2 Sam.  v.  14  and  1 Chron.  iii.  5. 

Ver.  38. — Which  was  the  son  of  God — as  handiwork,  not  as  son ; 
for  God,  even  as  a potter,  formed  and  fashioned  Adam  the  first  man 
out  of  the  earth.  And  hence  the  Arabic  version  renders  “ who  was 
from  God”  whereas,  in  other  cases,  it  renders,  for  “who  was,”  “son.”

THE  GENEALOGY  OF  CHRIST.

S.  Luke,  then,  brings  the  genealogy  of  Christ  up  to  Adam,  but 
S.  Matthew  only  to  Abraham— the  father  of  the  faithful,  and  founder 
of  the  Synagogue. 

Why  does  S.  Luke  make  this  addition  ? 

1.  S.  Athanasius  (Discourse  on  “ All  things  are  given  unto  Me 
by  My  Father  ”)  says,  “ Luke,  beginning  with  the  Son  of  God,  went 
back  up  to  Adam,  to  show  that  the  body  which  Jesus  assumed  had 
its  origin  from  Adam,  who  was  formed  by  God.” 

2.  S.  Irenseus  (book  iii.  ch.  xxxiii.)  says,  “ So  was  Christ  made  the 
beginning  of  the  living,  since  Adam  was  made  the  beginning  of  the 
dead  ; for  this  cause  also  S.  Luke,  beginning  the  commencement  of 
th#  generation  with  the  Lord,  brings  it  back  to  Adam,  signifying 
that  they  did  not  regenerate  Him,  but  He  them,  into  the  Gospel 
of  life.” 

3.  S.  Leo  (Serm.  x.  De  NativitaU  Domini ) says,  “ The 
evangelist  Luke  traced  the  genealogy  of  the  Lord’s  race  from  His 
birth,  to  show  that  even  those  ages  which  came  before  the  deluge 
were  joined  to  this  mystery  and  that  all  the  steps  of  the  succession 
tended  to  Him  in  whom  alone  was  the  salvation  of  all.” 

4.  Francis  Lucas  says  that  it  was  in  order  that  S.  Luke  might 
signify  that  through  Jesus  men  are  led  back  to  God,  having  been 
through  Adam  led  away  from  God. 

Symbolically,  Euthymius  says,  “ Luke,  beginning  from  the 
humanity  of  Christ,  leads  back  to  His  Divinity,  showing  that 
Christ  indeed  began  as  man,  but  that  as  God  He  was  without 
beginning. 

5.  S.  Ambrose  gives  another  reason,  “Now,  what  could  be  more 
fair  and  fitting  with  respect  to  Adam  who,  according  to  the  Apostle, 
received  the  figure  of  Christ,  than  that  the  sacred  generation  should 
begin  with  the  Son  of  God  and  end  with  the  Son  of  God ; and  that 
he  that  was  created  should  precede  in  figure,  that  He  that  was  bom 
might  follow  in  truth ; and  that  he  who  was  made  in  the  image  of 
God  should  go  before,  for  whose  sake  the  likeness  of  God  came 
down.” 

6.  S.  Augustine  (de  Consens.  Evang.  book  ii.  ch.  iv.)  recounts

S.  LUKE,  C.  III. 


156 

the  seventy-seven  generations  here  given,  by  which,  he  says,  is 
signified  the  remission  and  abolition  of  all  sins  whatever,  to  be  made 
by  the  Saviour  Jesus,  according  to  the  words  of  Christ,  “ I say  not 
unto  thee  unto  seven  times  but  unto  seventy  times  seven.” 

Lastly,  notice  here  the  noble  pedigree  of  Christ  which  S.  Luke  and 
S.  Matthew  trace  from  Jesus  Himself  through  so  many  kings, 
prophets,  and  patriarchs  to  Adam,  the  first  made — nay,  to  God  Him- 
self, through  four  thousand  years,  in  one  unbroken  line.  For  there 
is  no  prince  or  king  in  all  the  world  who  can  trace  his  descent  in  a 
straight  line  for  a thousand  years.  As  to  why  Christ  deferred  His 
coming  and  incarnation  for  so  long,  Barradi  gives  ten  moral  reasons 
in  vol.  L,  book  v.,  ch.  xxxi. 

This  generation  of  Christ  was  prefigured  by  Jacob’s  ladder.  So 
says  Rupertus  (on  Matt  L),  “This  generation  is  Jacob’s  ladder; 
and  the  sides  of  the  ladder  are  the  princes  and  fathers  of  the  gene- 
ration, Abraham  and  David,  to  whom  the  promise  was  made. 
The  last  step,  on  which  the  Lord  leaned,  is  the  Blessed  Joseph, 
He  leaned  on  him  as  a pupil  on  his  master.” 

Tropologically,  “who  was ” is  significant  of  the  vanity  of  this 
world,  the  life  of  man  passes  away,  generation  by  generation,  and 
is  straightway  turned  from  the  present  into  the  past,  from 
to  “ was.n — So  the  poet  sings : 

Adieu  to  Ilium  (fuit  Ilium)  and  the  high  renown  of  Teucer’s  race.

I  The  temptation  and  fasting  of  Christ . 13  He  over cometh  the  devil:  14  btginnetk 
to  preach.  16  The  people  of  Nazareth  admire  his  gracious  words . 33  Ho

sick  persons.  41  The  devils  acknowledge  Christ,  and  are  reproved  for  it.  43  He

A ND  Jesus  being  full  of  the  Holy  Ghost  returned  from  Jordan,  and  was  led  by 
x\.  the  Spirit  into  the  wilderness, 

2 Being  forty  days  tempted  of  the  deviL  And  in  those  days  he  did  eat  nothing  : 
and  when  they  were  ended,  he  afterward  hungered. 

3 And  the  devil  said  unto  him.  If  thou  be  the  Son  of  God,  command  this 
stone  that  it  be  made  bread. 

4 And  Jesus  answered  him,  saying,  It  is  written,  That  man  shall  not  live  by 
bread  alone,  but  by  every  word  of  God. 

5 And  the  devil,  taking  him  up  into  an  high  mountain,  shewed  unto  him  all 
the  kingdoms  of  the  world  in  a moment  of  time. 

6 And  the  devil  said  unto  him,  All  this  power  will  I give  thee,  and  the  glory 
of  them : for  that  is  delivered  unto  me ; and  to  whomsoever  I will  I give  it 

7 If  thou  therefore  wilt  worship  me,  all  shall  be  thine. 

8 And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  him,  Get  thee  behind  me,  Satan : for  it 
is  written,  Thou  shalt  worship  the  Lord  thy  God,  and  him  only  shalt  thou  serve. 

9 And  he  brought  him  to  Jerusalem,  and  set  him  on  a pinnacle  of  the  temple, 
and  said  unto  him,  If  thou  be  the  Son  of  God,  cast  thyself  down  from  hence : 

10  For  it  is  written,  He  shall  give  his  angels  charge  over  thee,  to  keep  thee  : 

11  And  in  their  hands  they  shall  bear  thee  up,  lest  at  any  time  thou  dash  thy 
foot  against  a stone. 

12  And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  him,  It  is  said,  Thou  shalt  not  tempt  the 
Lord  thy  God. 

13  And  when  the  devil  had  ended  all  the  temptation,  he  departed  from  him  for 
a season. 

14  T And  Jesus  returned  in  the  power  of  the  Spirit  into  Galilee : and  there 
went  out  a fame  of  him  through  all  the  region  round  about. 

1 5 And  he  taught  in  their  synagogues,  being  glorified  of  all. 

16  T And  he  came  to  Nazareth,  where  he  had  been  brought  up : and,  as  his 
custom  was,  he  went  into  the  synagogue  on  the  sabbath  day,  and  stood  up  for  to 
read. 

17  And  there  was  delivered  unto  him  the  book  of  the  prophet  Esaias.  And 
when  he  had  opened  the  book,  he  found  the  place  where  it  was  written,

S.  LUKE,  C.  IV. 


18  The  Spirit  of  the  Lord  is  upon  me,  because  he  hath  anointed  me  to  preach 
the  gospel  to  the  poor ; he  hath  sent  me  to  heal  the  brokenhearted,  to  preach 
deliverance  to  the  captives,  and  recovering  of  sight  to  the  blind,  to  set  at  liberty 
them  that  are  bruised, 

19  To  preach  the  acceptable  year  of  the  Lord. 

20  And  he  closed  the  book,  and  he  gave  it  again  to  the  minister,  and  sat  down. 
And  the  eyes  of  all  them  that  were  in  the  synagogue  were  fastened  on  him. 

21  And  he  began  to  say  unto  them,  This  day  is  this  scripture  fulfilled  in  your 
ears. 

22  And  all  bare  him  witness,  and  wondered  at  the  gracious  words  which  pro- 
ceeded out  of  his  mouth.  And  they  said,  Is  not  this  Joseph’s  son? 

23  And  he  said  unto  them,  Ye  will  surely  say  unto  me  this  proverb,  Physician, 
heal  thyself : whatsoever  we  have  heard  done  in  Capernaum,  do  also  here  in  thy 
country. 

24  And  he  said,  Verily  I say  unto  you,  No  prophet  is  accepted  in  his  own 
country. 

25  But  I tell  you  of  a truth,  many  widows  were  in  Israel  in  the  days  of  Elias, 
when  the  heaven  was  shut  up  three  years  and  six  months,  when  great  famine  was 
throughout  all  the  land  ; 

26  But  unto  none  of  them  was  Elias  sent,  save  unto  Sarepta,  a city  of  Sidon, 
unto  a woman  that  was  a widow. 

27  And  many  lepers  were  in  Israel  in  the  time  of  Eliseus  the  prophet ; and 
none  of  them  was  cleansed,  saving  Naaman  the  Syrian. 

28  And  all  they  in  the  synagogue,  when  they  heard  these  things,  were  filled 
with  wrath, 

29  And  rose  up,  and  thrust  him  out  of  the  city,  and  led  him  unto  the  brow  of 
the  hill  whereon  their  city  was  built,  that  they  might  cast  him  down  headlong. 

30  But  he  passing  through  the  midst  of  them  went  his  way, 

31  And  came  down  to  Capernaum,  a city  of  Galilee,  and  taught  them  on  the 
sabbath  days. 

32  And  they  were  astonished  at  his  doctrine : for  his  word  was  with  power. 

33  T And  in  the  synagogue  there  was  a man,  which  had  a spirit  of  an  unclean 
devil,  and  cried  out  with  a loud  voice, 

34  Saying,  Let  us  alone  ; what  have  we  to  do  with  thee,  thou  Jesus  of  Nazareth  ? 
art  thou  come  to  destroy  us  ? I know  thee  who  thou  art ; the  Holy  One  of  God. 

35  And  Jesus  rebuked  him,  saying,  Hold  thy  peace,  and  come  out  of  him.  And 
when  the  devil  had  thrown  him  in  the  midst,  he  came  out  of  him,  and  hurt  him 
not. 

36  And  they  were  all  amazed,  and  spake  among  themselves,  saying,  What  a 
word  is  this  1 for  with  authority  and  power  he  commandeth  the  unclean  spirits, 
and  they  come  out. 

37  And  the  fame  of  him  went  out  into  every  place  of  the  country  round  about. 

38  % And  he  arose  out  of  the  synagogue,  and  entered  into  Simon’s  house.  And 
Simon’s  wife’s  mother  was  taken  with  a great  fever ; and  they  besought  him  for 
her. 

39  And  he  stood  over  her,  and  rebuked  the  fever ; and  it  left  her : and  im- 
mediately she  arose  and  ministered  unto  them. 

40  IT  Now  when  the  sun  was  setting,  all  they  that  had  any  sick  with  divers

diseases  brought  them  unto  him ; and  he  laid  his  hands  on  every  one  of  them, 
and  healed  them. 

41  And  devils  also  came  out  of  many,  crying  out,  and  saying,  Thou  art  Christ 
the  Son  of  God.  And  he  rebuking  than  suffered  them  not  to  speak : for  they 
knew  that  he  was  Christ 

42  And  when  it  was  day,  he  departed  and  went  into  a desert  place : and  the 
people  sought  him,  and  came  unto  him,  and  stayed  him,  that  he  should  not 
depart  from  them. 

43  And  he  said  unto  them,  I must  preach  the  kingdom  of  God  to  other  cities 
also  : for  therefore  am  I sent. 

44  And  he  preached  in  the  synagogues  of  Galilee. 

Ver.  1. — And  Jesus,  being  full  of  the  Holy  Ghost \ returned  from 
Jordan,  having  been  there  baptized  by  John  a little  time  before,  and 
having  visibly  received  the  Holy  Spirit,  whose  fulness  He  had 
already  obtained  uivisibly  in  the  first  instant  of  His  conception. 

Ver.  2. — Tempted  of  the  devil.  In  the  Greek  wi/*a£4&iwc,  suffer- 
ing or  sustaining  temptation  by  the  devil  See  Commentary  on 
Matt  iv.  5. 

Ver.  5. — In  a moment  of  time.  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ It  is  not  so 
much  the  quickness  of  the  view  which  is  indicated,  as  the  fleeting 
frailty  of  power  which  is  expressed.  For  in  a moment  they  all  pass 
away.  And  often  the  honour  of  the  world  is  gone  ere  it  is  come. 
For  what  can  be  lasting  in  the  world  when  the  worlds  themselves 
are  not  lasting.” 

Ver.  14. — And  Jesus  returned0 in  the  power  of  the  Spirit  into  Galilee 
In  the  Greek  bwdfjui,  in  the  power,  strength,  or  force  of  the  Spirit 
Under  a strong  impulse  of  the  Spirit,  Jesus  returned  to  Galilee. 
For  the  Holy  Ghost  was  moving  Him,  and  powerfully  impelling 
Him  to  put  forth  at  this  time  that  spiritual  power  which  He  had 
received  from  the  beginning  of  His  conception,  but  which  He  had 
hitherto  shut  up  and  hidden  within  Himself,  and  to  begin  in 
Galilee  with  immense  ardour  and  zeal,  His  ministry  of  preaching, 
and  confirm  it  by  His  admirable  holiness  of  life  and  His  stupendous 
miracles.  Hence  Theophylact  renders  it  Momm,  driven  and  urged 
on  by  the  enthusiasm  and  Divine  afflatus  of  the  Holy  Ghost 

Ver.  16. — And  He  came  to  Nazareth . Note  here  that  while 
Christ  is  said,  in  v.  14,  to  have  gone  into  Galilee,  He  is  not  said  to 
have  entered  Nazareth  which  is  situated  there,  as  S.  Matthew  (ch.  iv.

13)  has  it,  but  Capernaum,  and  there  to  have  done  the  things  which 
S.  Matthew  relates  in  chaps,  iv.  to  xiii.,  all  of  which  S.  Luke  passes  over 
here,  and  then  He  is  said  to  have  come  to  Nazareth.  S.  Luke  wished 
at  the  very  outset  to  state  the  reason  why  Christ  would  not  teach 
in  Nazareth,  namely,  that  He  was  despised  by  His  fellow-townsmen 
as  being  the  son  of  a carpenter.  And  though  this  only  happened 
subsequently,  yet  Christ  foresaw  that  it  would  be  the  case,  and 
therefore  turned  aside  from  Nazareth  and  went  to  Capernaum,  which 
He  made  the  seat  of  His  ministry,  as  S.  Matthew  relates  in  iv.  13. 

And  stood  up  for  to  read 1 It  was  (and  still  is)  the  custom  among 
the  Jews  that  each  one  should  read  the  Hebrew  books  of  Holy 
Scripture  in  the  synagogue  on  the  Sabbath-day,  both  that  he  might 
learn  the  law  of  God  from  it,  and  also  that  he  might  be  stirred  up 
to  the  worship,  love,  and  service  of  God.  Moreover,  it  was  the  part 
of  the  Rabbin  and  the  teachers,  such  as  Jesus  was,  to  read  the  Holy 
Scripture  publicly,  to  interpret  it,  to  preach,  and  to  teach. 

Ver.  17. — And  there  was  delivered  unto  Him  (by  the  attendant) 
the  book  of  the  prophet  Esaias.  This  was  done  by  the  counsel  and 
direction  of  God,  that  Jesus  might  show  from  Isaiah  that  He  was 
the  Messiah  described  by  that  prophet 

And  when  He  had  opened  the  book , He  found  the  place  where  it  was 
written  (Isa.  lxi.  1).  Christ  seems  so  to  have  opened  the  book  that, 
without  looking  for  it,  He  lighted  upon  this  passage  of  Isaiah  by 
the  will  and  guidance  of  God.  The  Vulgate,  “as  He  unrolled  the 
book,”  is  better;  and  Vatablus,  “when  He  had  unfolded;”  others, 
" when  He  had  spread  out,”  for  this  is  the  meaning  of  the  Greek 
For  the  books  of  the  Hebrews  were  not  divided  into 
leaves,  but  consisted  of  one  long  piece  of  parchment  which  was 
rolled  round  a cylinder  from  beginning  to  end,  as  maps  are  nowa- 
days.  In  order  to  read  this  parchment  it  was  therefore  necessary  to 
unroll  it,  and  spread  it  out 

Ver.  18. — The  Spirit  of  the  Lord  is  upon  me:  because  He  hath 
anointed  me.  The  Holy  Spirit,  who  was  in  Me  from  the  beginning, 
descending  upon  Me  here  in  the  baptism  which  I have  now  received 
from  John  the  Baptist,  descending  visibly  in  the  form  of  a dove,

GIVING  SIGHT  TO  THE  BLIND. 


161 

while  the  voice  of  God  the  Father  spoke  forth  in  thunder,  “ This 
is  My  beloved  Son ; hear  ye  Him,”  has  by  this  sign,  as  by  a visible 
anointing,  publicly  declared,  authorised,  and,  as  it  were,  consecrated 
Me  as  the  Teacher,  Prophet,  Saviour,  and  Lawgiver  of  the  world, 
and  especially  of  the  Jews  to  whom  I was  promised,  and  therefore — 
He  hath  anointed  Me  to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the  poor , for  the  rich 
Scribes  and  Pharisees  despise  My  lowliness  and  My  poverty. 

Observe  the  words  “ hath  anointed  me ; ” for  in  Hebrew 
“ Messiah,”  and  in  Greek  Xfterlf,  mean  “anointed.”  This  anointing 
of  Christ  was  accomplished  secretly  in  the  Incarnation — 

(i.)  By  the  grace  of  the  hypostatic  union,  which  made  Him 
in  the  highest  degree  holy  and  divine — nay,  made  Him  God. 

(2.)  By  the  plenitude  of  graces  which  flowed  from  this  union. 
For  other  saints  are  said  to  be  anointed  with  the  grace  and  the 
gifts  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  but  Christ  was  anointed  with  the  Holy 
Ghost  Himself,  as  though  with  the  very  fountain  and  plenitude 
of  all  graces,  that  the  Man  Christ  might  become  a superabundant 
fountain  pouring  forth  its  grace  into  all  the  apostles,  martyrs,  virgins, 
and  confessors,  so  says  Basil  ( de  Spiritu  Sancto,  ch.  xxvi.).  Christ 
was,  as  I have  said,  publicly  anointed  in  His  baptism,  to  heal  them 
that  are  brokenhearted — to  heal  and  console  those  who,  by  reason 
of  their  sins,  and  the  burden  of  the  law  of  Moses,  as  well  as  their 
ignorance  of  the  things  of  God,  are  afflicted  in  spirit,  and  pant  for 
the  knowledge  of  God,  His  pardon,  His  grace,  and  His  salvation, 
and  who,  therefore,  look  for  the  Messiah.  Hence  Symmachus 
and  Theodotus  render  it ; so  S.  Jerome  tells  us  in  his  Commentary 
on  Isa.  lxi.,  “to  bind  up  the  wounds  of  sinners.” 

To  preach  deliverance  to  the  captives — that  I may  preach,  announce, 
and  bring  freedom,  through  penance  and  My  grace,  to  those  who 
are  held  captive  by  sin  and  the  devil 

And  recovering  of  sight  to  the  blind.  The  Hebrew  and  Chaldee 
versions  of  Isaiah  give  “ opening  to  those  bound?  i.e.,  as  Symmachus 
has  it,  “ loosening  to  those  bound?  But  the  Septuagint,  and  S.  Luke 
following  them,  render  it  in  the  Greek  a>aj8Xrs|/i>,  “ looking  again? 

that  they  may  see  again.  For  the  Hebrews  call  those  that  are

blind  bound , or  shut , like  the  Latin  idiom,  “ Moles  seized  in  their 
eyes,”  and  consequently  they  call  the  illumination  by  which  the 
eyes  of  the  blind  are  opened  “ opening.”  The  meaning,  therefore, 
is,  Christ  sliall  both  restore  sight  to  those  who  are  physically,  and 
illumine  those  who  are  spiritually,  blind,  and  are  ignorant  of  God 
and  of  the  way  of  salvation.  He  shall  teach  them  the  knowledge 
of  God  and  the  way  to  save  their  souls.  This  was  what  Isaiah 
(xlii.  7)  clearly  foretold  that  the  Messiah  should  do : “I  will  give 
Thee  for  a covenant  of  the  people,  for  a light  of  the  Gentiles, 
to  open  the  eyes  of  the  blind.”  And  hence  it  is  plain  that 
Isaiah  in  ch.  xlii.,  is  not  speaking  literally  of  the  deliverance 
from  the  Babylonian  captivity  wrought  by  Cyrus,  as  Toletus  would 
have  it,  but  of  the  deliverance  from  the  captivity  of  sin  and  of  the 
devil  wrought  by  Christ ; for  Cyrus  restored  sight  to  no  one,  but 
Christ  to  many.  I confess,  however,  that  there  is  an  allusion  to 
Cyrus,  he  being  a type  of  Christ  To  the  Hebrews  in  Babylon  who 
were  “bound”  he  gave  “opening  and  loosening,”  as  the  Hebrew 
version  has  it,  when  he  freed  them  from  captivity  and  sent  them 
back  into  Judaea. 

To  set  at  liberty  them  that  are  bruised — into  liberty  and  health. 
The  Arabic  has  “ to  send  thee  bound  into  remission.”  Pagninus, 
“that  I may  send  forth  the  broken  by  remission.”  So  also 
Vatablus.  These  words  are  not  in  Isaiah  lxi.  1 in  the  Hebrew; 
they  have  been  added  paraph rastically  by  S.  Luke  or  his  inter- 
preter, and  seem  to  form  another  explanation  of  “ to  heal  them  that 
are  brokenhearted.”  So  Forerius  on  Isaiah  lxl,  and  Francis  Lucas 
on  this  passage.  Origen  omits  “to  heal  them  that  are  broken- 
hearted,” and  reads  instead,  “ to  send  forth  the  broken  into  liberty ; ” 
and  he  adds,  “ What  was  so  broken  or  shattered  as  the  man  who, 
when  sent  away  by  Jesus,  was  healed  ? ” 

For  “broken”  the  Greek  has  which  Vatablus  and 

others  translate  “broken.”

year — in  Hebrew  P2H  J"OD,  scenat  ratson ; in  the  Septuagint  fwaurii

others  with  propriety,  44  the  year  of  the  good  pleasure,**  of  divine 
benevolence  and  liberality,  such  as  was  the  year  of  the  jubilee  to 
which  he  here  alludes.  For  the  year  of  the  jubilee  was  the  type 
and  figure  of  this  evangelical  year  which  Christ  brought  So  the 
whole  time  of  the  preaching  of  Christ,  and  thenceforward  all  the 
time  of  Christianity,  is  a year  of  jubilee  to  those  who  obey  Christ 
and  accept  His  liberty — a year  of  grace,  mercy,  peace,  remission, 
liberality,  and  salvation,  in  which,  after  God’s  long  anger  against  us, 
we  are  restored  to  His  grace,  His  favour,  His  heirship.  His  glory, 
and  all  the  former  blessings  which  we  had  in  Paradise  in  the  state 
of  innocence.  This  is  what  S.  Paul  says  in  a Cor.  vi.  2,  44  Behold, 
now  is  the  acceptable  time ; behold,  now  is  the  day  of  salvation.’* 

The  Vulgate  adds,  and  the  day  of  retribution , of  vengeance. 
The  year  of  the  jubilee,  that  is,  the  time  of  Christianity,  shall  be  to 
the  enemies  of  Christ  a time  of  vengeance,  when  God  shall  avenge 
the  human  race  on  its  enemies  and  oppressors,  the  demons  that 
oppress  it ; for  Christ  shall  deliver  men  from  the  devils,  and  shall 
cast  them  down,  according  to  Isaiah  xxxv.  4,  “Say  unto  the 
timid,  Be  comforted,  and  fear  not ; behold,  your  God  shall  bring 
the  vengeance  of  retribution.  God  Himself  shall  come  and  shall 
save  you.”  Vulgate.  And  Christ  says,  in  John  xii.  31,  “ Now  is  the 
judgment  of  the  world,  now  shall  the  prince  of  this  world  be  cast 
forth.** 

Ver.  20. — And  the  eyes  of  all  them  that  were  in  the  synagogue 
were  fastened  on  Him . “ That  they  might  hear,”  says  Euthymius, 

44  how  He  interpreted  what  He  had  read.”  For  already  the  fame  of 
what  He  had  said  and  done  at  Capernaum  had  been  noised  abroad 
everywhere,  so  that  many  held  Him  to  be  the  Messiah ; and  they 
especially  desired  to  hear  this  from  Christ.  For  they  knew  that  the 
passage  of  Isaiah  read  by  Him  was  a prophecy  of  the  Messiah,  and  so 
they  listened  with  eagerness  to  Him  while  He  explained  it. 

Ver.  21. — And  He  began  to  say  unto  themi  This  day  is  this  Scrip- 
ture (“  which  has  sounded,**  says  Euthymius,  and  the  Syriac  version),

rest  of  the  poor  of  Galilee  the  year  of  full  remission,  and  I am  prepared 
to  do,  nay,  I have  already  done  in  Capernaum,  all  that  Isaiah  has 
here  foretold.  I am  the  Messiah  of  whom  Isaiah  there  prophesies, 
whom  you,  in  accordance  with  the  predictions  of  Jacob  and  Daniel, 
are  already  eagerly  expecting  every  moment.  For,  though  Jesus  does 
not  clearly  say  that  He  is  the  Messiah,  yet  He  tacitly  implies  it. 

Ver.  22. — And  all  bare  Him  witness , and  wondered  at  the  gracious 
words  which  proceeded  out  of  His  mouth . And  they  said}  Is  not  this 
Josephs  son t “Words  of  grace,”  he  calls  them  (1)  gracious, 
beautiful,  suave,  and  pleasant ; (2)  full  of  grace  and  the  Holy  Spirit ; 
(3)  efficacious  to  move  and  persuade ; (4)  full  of  wisdom  and 
eloquence,  so  as  to  convince  those  that  heard  them.  For  Christ 
spoke  with  a tongue  that  was  more  than  human.  “ He  was  teach- 
ing them  as  one  having  power,  and  not  as  the  Scribes,”  Matt.  vii.  29. 

Bore  Him  testimony — that  He  spoke  well,  not  that  He  was  the 
Messiah.  Hence  they  call  Him  “ the  son  of  Joseph  ; ” and,  a little 
after,  when  they  were  rebuked  by  Him,  they  despised  Him  and 
wished  to  cast  Him  down  headlong.  So,  nowadays,  many  people 
praise  a preacher  so  long  as  he  says  to  them  what  is  pleasing  and 
elegant,  but  when  he  attacks  their  vices  they  abuse  and  persecute 
him.  Such  is  the  way  of  the  fickle  multitude,  who  love  themselves 
and  their  own  desires.  However,  Bede  takes  this  as  meaning  that 
they  bore  witness  that  He  was  the  Messiah  of  whom  Isaiah  had 
prophesied  these  things;  and  he  adds: — “How  great  their  blind- 
ness, when,  only  on  account  of  their  knowledge  of  His  origin,  and 
because  they  had  seen  Him  nourished,  and  that  He  had  developed, 
through  the  stages  of  life  among  themselves,  they  set  Him  at 
nought  whom,  by  his  words  and  works,  they  knew  to  be  Christ.” 

Ver.  23. — And  He  said  unto  them , ye  will  surely  say  unto  Me  this 
proverb  (in  the  Greek  flratajSoXj}*  — parable,  proverb,  or  adage,  in 
common  use),  Physician , heal  thyself—  that  is,  cure  Thine  own  people 
and  Thine  own  country,  which  should  be  as  dear  to  Thee  as  Thy- 
self; cure  Thy  fellow-Nazarenes  as  Thou  hast  cured  or  art  said  to 
have  cured  the  Capernaites.  Thus  it  was  that  Christ  presently 
explains  it,  He,  by  His  Divine  Spirit,  seeing  the  hidden  thoughts  of

the  Nazarenes,  and  that  they  were  wishing  in  their  hearts  for  that 
which  He  now  said.  Anticipating  their  secret  thought,  He  meets 
and  answers  it  “ It  was  common  among  the  Jews,”  says  Titus,  “to 
taunt  physicians  who  had  caught  any  disease  with  this  impudent  and 
ironical  saying,  Physician,  heal  thyself.”  For  the  common  sense  of 
mankind  holds,  and  reason  favours  the  opinion,  that  he  who  can 
not  cure  himself,  or  neglects  to  do  so,  cannot  cure  others  or  should 
not  attempt  it  In  point  of  fact,  however,  experience  not  seldom 
shows  that  the  physician  who  cures  others  is  unable  to  effect  his 
own  cure,  but  hands  himself  over  to  other  physicians  to  be  treated, 
because  appetite  often  blinds  the  reason,  and  diseases  obscure 
one’s  scientific  knowledge.  Hence  we  judge  better  and  more  safely 
about  the  diseases  of  others  than  about  our  own.  Self-love  often 
perverts  our  judgment,  so  that  Solomon  warns  us  with  the  words, 
“Lean  not  unto  thine  own  understanding,”  Prov.  iii.  5. 

Tropologically,  S.  Anthony  thus  expounded  the  saying,  “Physician, 
heal  thyself ; ” He  that  will  cure  the  faults  of  others  let  him  first  cure 
his  own.  For  they  that  will  help  others  before  they  cure  themselves 
shall  relapse  into  their  own  faults.  Indeed  experience  teaches  us  that 
they  who  remedy  any  fault  in  themselves  easily  cure  it  in  others. 

Whatsoever  we  have  heard  done  in  Capernaum,  do  also  here  in  Thy 
country . Hence  it  is  plain  that  these  events  took  place  in  Nazareth 
after  Jesus  had  preached  and  worked  many  miracles  in  the  city  of 
Capernaum,  as  has  been  said  at  v.  16,  and  S.  Augustine  ( De  Consensu , 
bk.  ii.  cap.  42)  observes.  The  Gloss  interprets,  “ VVe  do  not  believe 
what  a vague  rumour  has  published,  seeing  that  among  us,  on  whom 
favours  of  the  kind  would  have  been  more  fittingly  conferred,  Thou  hast 
done  no  such  work.”  Here  in  Nazareth,  Thy  fatherland  which  con- 
ceived Thee,  nourished  Thee,  and  brought  Thee  unto  manhood,  Thou 
hast  brethren,  sisters,  kinsfolk,  and  neighbours,  some  rich,  others  poor, 
some  sick,  others  suffering  in  other  respects.  Why  then  dost  Thou 
not  miraculously  succour  these  Thine  own  people,  to  whom  Thou  art 
bound  by  blood,  by  love  of  home,  and  by  natural  affection  ? 

Ver.  24. — And  He  said,  Verily  I say  unto  you,  No  prophet  is 
accepted  in  his  own  country . Ye,  O Nazarenes,  despise  Me  as  your

fellow-townsman,  and  the  son  of  a carpenter;  wherefore  you  are 
unworthy  that  I should  confer  benefits  upon  you.  Therefore  (says 
the  Interlinear),  I work  not  among  you,  not  because  I hate  my  own 
country,  but  because  you  are  incredulous.  S.  Cyril  adds  that  a 
citizen,  being  always  near  to  his  fellow-citizens,  is  deprived  of  the 
reverence  which  is  his  due  at  the  hands  of  those  who  know  him. 

Thirdly,  S.  Chrysostom  says,  “ Christ  had  abstained  from  miracles 
among  the  Nazarenes  that  He  might  not  provoke  them  to  envy.” 
For,  as  S.  Ambrose  says,  God  is  a despiser  of  the  envious  ; and  the 
Gloss  remarks  that  it  is  almost  natural  for  fellow-citizens  to  envy  one 
another;  nor  do  they  take  account  of  merit,  but  call  to  mind  a 
man’s  frail  childhood. 

Chrysologus  (Serm.  48,  at  the  end,)  remarks,  “To  be  powerful  is, 
among  one’s  own  people,  a biting  and  a burning ; to  be  eminent 
among  one’s  fellow-citizens  and  neighbours  burns  up  one’s  neigh- 
bours’ glory;  and  if  neighbours  owe  honour  to  a neighbour  they 
count  it  slavery.”  There  is  an  amusing  apologue  of  a parrot,  which 
touches  this  subject.  A parrot,  brought  from  the  East  to  the  West, 
where  birds  of  this  kind  are  not  common,  wondered  that  he  was 
held  in  greater  esteem  and  honour  than  he  had  been  accustomed  to 
in  his  own  country.  He  occupied  an  ivory  cage  plaited  with  silver 
wire,  and  fed  on  the  daintiest  viands,  such  as  did  not  fall  to  the  share 
of  the  others,  which  were  only  western  birds,  but  inferior  to  himself 
neither  in  beauty  nor  in  the  power  of  imitating  the  human  voice. 
Then  says  a turtle-dove,  shut  up  in  the  same  cage  with  him,  “There 
is  nothing  wonderful  in  this,  for  no  one  receives  in  his  own  country 
the  honour  which  is  his  due.” 

Tropologically,  Christ  here  teaches  the  faithful,  particularly  men 
devoted  to  the  Apostolic  calling,  that  they  ought  to  curb  or  to  divert 
themselves  of  all  excessive  affection  for  their  own  country  and  kins- 
folk, that  they  may  be  useful  to  all  men — 

u The  fishes*  native  country  is  the  boundless  sea  ; 

Let  the  wide  earth  the  brave  man’s  country  be.” 

S.  Gregory  Nazianzen  (Orat.  xviii.)  says  very  well,  “ For  great  and 
noble  men  there  is  one  country — that  Jerusalem  which  is  per-

ceived  by  the  mind,  not  those  countries  which  we  see  here,  now 
inhabited  by  one  race  of  men,  now  by  another.”  And  again 
(Ora/,  xxv.)  “These  earthly  fatherlands,  these  differences  of  race, 
are  the  scenes,  the  illusions,  of  this  our  short  fleeting  life.  For 
whatsoever  country  each  one  has  previously  got  possession  of, 
whether  by  injustice  or  by  misfortune,  that  is  called  his  country, 
while  we  are  all  alike  strangers  and  sojourners,  however  much  we 
may  play  upon  the  meaning  of  words.”  Such  was  S.  Basil,  of  whom 
S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa,  in  his  life,  writes,  “ Basil  the  Great  was  free 
from  the  fear  of  exile,  because  he  held  that  the  only  fatherland  of 
men  was  Paradise,  and  regarded  all  the  earth  as  nature’s  common 
place  of  exile.” 

Vers.  25  and  26. — Bui  I tell  you  of  a truth , many  widows  were 
in  Israel  in  the  days  of  Elias , when  the  heaven  was  shut  up  three 
years  and  six  months , when  great  famine  was  throughout  all  the  land; 
But  unto  none  of  them  was  Elias  sent , save  unto  Sarepta , a city  of 
Sidon , unto  a woman  that  was  a widow.  Thru  years  and  six  months — 
This  does  not  appear  in  the  Old  Testatment,  but  Jesus,  as  God, 
knew  it,  and  revealed  it  to  S.  James,  Ep.  v.  17,  for  as  to  what  is 
said  in  1 Kings  xviii.  1,  “The  word  of  the  Lord  came  to  Elias,  in 
the  third  year,  saying,  Go  and  show  thyself  to  Ahab  that  I may 
give  rain  upon  the  face  of  the  earth.”  This  third  year  is  not  to  be 
taken  from  the  beginning  of  the  drought,  but  as  from  the  sojourn 
of  Elias  in  Sarepta. 

In  all  the  land — Israel  and  the  neighbouring  region,  such  as  Sidon, 
and  Sarepta,  where  this  widow  was. 

The  sense  is  that,  as  Elias,  in  the  time  of  the  famine,  procured 
food  for  no  Israelite,  but  only  for  the  widow  of  Sarepta,  a Sidonian, 
a Gentile,  and  a foreigner,  because,  valuing  the  prophet  very  highly, 
and  believing  him  that  God  would  provide  for  her  hunger  accord- 
ing to  his  word,  she  gave  him  the  little  oil  and  meal  which  she  had, 
postponing  her  own  and  her  children’s  wants  to  his ; so  Christ,  in 
like  manner,  puts  the  Capemaites  before  the  Nazarenes,  His  own 
fellow-citizens,  because  the  former  hear  Him  as  a Teacher  sent  from 
Heaven,  honour  Him  and  pay  Him  respect,  but  the  latter  despise

Him  as  a carpenter,  and  their  own  fellow-townsman ; and  so  He 
imparts  to  the  former  the  spiritual  bread  of  heavenly  doctrine  and 
miracles,  but  leaves  the  latter  in  their  spiritual  want  For  Elias 
was  the  type  and  precursor  of  Christ,  and  the  widow  of  Sarepta  the 
type  and  first-fruits  of  the  Gentiles  whom  Christ  preferred  before  the 
Jews,  His  fellow-countrymen.  Bede  says  that  “Sidon”in  Hebrew 
signifies  “useless  hunting;”  “Sarepta,”  “conflagration”  or  “needi- 
ness ” — namely,  of  bread  ; that  is,  the  Gentile  world  given  up  to  the 
pursuit  of  worldly  things,  and  suffering  from  the  conflagration  of  their 
carnal  passions  and  the  want  of  spiritual  bread.  Elias  is  the  prophetic 
word,  which,  being  received,  feeds  the  hearts  of  them  that  believe. 

Ver.  27. — And  many  lepers  were  in  Israel  in  the  time  of  Eliseus 
the  prophet ; and  none  of  them  was  cleansed  saving  Naaman  the 
Syrian , a foreigner  and  a Gentile.  As  Elisha,  following  his 
master  Elias,  did  not  prophecy  to  the  Jews,  his  own  people, 
but  to  foreigners,  and  did  not  therefore  heal  the  lepers  that  were 
in  Judaea,  but  Naaman  the  Gentile,  by  reason  of  his  faith  and 
their  incredulity ; so  I preach  and  work  miracles  among  these 
Capemaite  strangers,  on  account  of  their  faith,  reverence,  and  good- 
will towards  Me,  but  I leave  you  Nazarenes  alone  for  your  infidelity, 
your  irreverence,  and  your  contempt  of  Me.  For  Elisha,  like  Elias, 
was  a type  and  forerunner  of  Christ;  and  Naaman  the  Gentile, 
a type  of  the  Gentiles  to  whom  Christ,  leaving  the  Jews,  would,  by 
the  apostles,  transfer  His  faith,  His  church,  and  His  grace.  So  Bede, 
Titus,  Theophylact,  Euthymius,  Jansenius,  Toletus,  and  others. 

Ver.  28. — And  all  they  in  the  synagogue , when  they  heard  these 
things,  were  filled  with  wrath — because  they  knew  that  they  were 
touched  by  these  two  examples  of  the  widow  and  Naaman,  as 
being  incredulous,  and  that  a slur  was  cast  upon  them  as  being 
unworthy  of  the  miracles  of  Jesus  ; and  again  because  they  were  in- 
dignant that  Jesus,  their  fellow-townsman  and  equal,  should  compare 
Himself  with,  and  place  Himself  before,  Elias  and  Elisha,  nay,  make 
Himself  out  the  Messiah,  from  the  prophecy  of  Isaiah ; and,  lastly, 
because  Christ  hinted  that  He  would  transfer  His  gifts  from  the  Jews 
to  the  Gentiles.  So  S.  Thomas,  Toletus,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others.

CHRIST  THRUST  OUT  OF  NAZARETH. 


169 


Ver.  29. — And  rose  up  and  thrust  him  out  of  the  city , and  led  him 
unto  the  brow  of  the  hill , whereon  their  city  was  built , that  they  might 
cast  him  down  headlong — “ led  him  ” — dragged  Him,  as  it  seemed  to 
them,  by  violence,  but,  in  reality,  Christ  of  His  own  accord  allowed 
Himself  to  be  led  and  dragged. 

That  they  might  cast  him  down  headlong — from  the  top  of  the 
hill  to  the  bottom,  and  so  kill  Him,  as  one  who  had  defamed  his 
own  native  place,  and  inflicted  injury  and  insult  upon  it;  and  there- 
fore they  brought  Him  forth  outside  of  the  city,  as  being  unworthy 
of  it,  that  they  might  cast  Him  from  the  top  of  the  mountain,  dash 
Him  down  upon  the  rocks,  and  break  His  whole  body  to  pieces. 
This  was  a grievous  piece  of  violence  on  the  part  of  the  Nazarenes 
against  Christ,  their  fellow-citizen,  and  thus,  as  Euthymius  observes, 
they  confirmed  in  act,  what  He  had  spoken  in  words,  namely,  that  a 
prophet  is  not  held  in  honour  in  his  own  country,  but  dishonoured, 
nay,  slain  ; and  that  therefore  the  Nazarenes  were  unworthy  of  the 
preaching  and  miracles  of  Christ. 

S.  Bonaventure,  Toletus,  and  others  add,  that  they  took  Christ  out 
of  the  city  to  the  top  of  the  hill  that  they  might  slay  Him  as  a blas- 
phemer, because  He  had  made  Himself  the  Messiah.  For  though, 
by  the  law,  the  blasphemer  was  to  be  stoned,  still  they  wished  to  cast 
Christ  headlong  upon  the  rocks  and  stones,  because  this  is  the  same  as 
if  they  had  stoned  Him.  Whether  the  stones  are  cast  at  the  man,  or 
the  man  hurled  headlong  upon  the  stones,  is  all  one ; indeed,  the  latter 
is  more  cruel  and  terrible.  So  it  was  that  they  cast  S.  Stephen  out  of 
Jerusalem  as  a blasphemer,  and  stoned  him  ; and  S.  James,  the  first 
Bishop  of  Jerusalem,  was  hurled  down  from  a pinnacle  of  the  Temple 
as  a blasphemer,  because  He  taught  that  Christ  was  the  Messiah 

S.  Ambrose  points  out  that  these  men  were  worse  than  the  devil, 
who  did  but  set  Christ  upon  a pinnacle  of  the  Temple,  and  say  to 
Him,  “Cast  thyself  down,”  while  these  did  their  best  to  hurl  Him 
down  by  force.  “The  heritage  of  the  disciples,”  he  says,  “is  worse 
than  that  of  the  master — he  tempts  the  Lord  by  word,  they  attempt 
His  life  by  their  act — he  says,  ‘Cast  thyself  down/ they  do  Him 
violence  in  order  to  cast  Him  down.”

Ver.  30. — But  He  passing  through  the  midst  of  them  went  His 
way . Maldonatus  thinks  that  Christ  here  made  Himself  invisible, 
S.  Ambrose  and  Bede  that  He  changed  their  wills,  so  that  they  con- 
sented to  let  Him  go.  Others  hold  the  better  opinion  that  Christ 
turned  away  their  imagination  or  their  eyes,  or  suspended  their  con- 
sciousness and  held  their  hands  and  feet,  so  that,  like  men  bereft  of 
their  senses,  though  they  saw  Him  they  could  not  or  dared  not  lay 
hold  of  Him.  Wherefore  Christ  here  manifested  His  Godhead.  S. 
Ambrose  says,  “ Behold ! the  minds  of  these  furious  men,  being 
suddenly  changed,  or  stupefied,  He  goes  down  through  the  midst  of 
them.”  And  he  adds  the  reason,  “For  when  He  wills  He  is  taken; 
when  He  wills  He  slips  away ; when  He  wills  He  is  slain ; because 
His  hour  had  not  yet  come,”  John  vii.  30.  For  as  yet  He  must 
preach,  and  at  last  be  crucified  at  Jerusalem  by  the  Fathers  decree, 
but  not  cast  down  headlong  in  Nazareth.  So  Bede,  S.  Chrysostom, 
Euthymius,  and  others.  Brocardus,  in  his  “ Description  of  the 
Holy  Land,”  gives  the  tradition  that  Christ  glided  away  from  out  of 
the  hands  of  the  Jews,  and  suddenly  appeared  on  the  opposite  side 
of  the  mountain,  and  that  therefore  the  place  is  called  “the  Leap 
of  the  Lord.”  N.  de  Lyra  adds  that  the  rock  on  which  Christ  stood 
yielded,  and  received  like  wax  the  impress  of  His  feet,  just  as, 
when  ascending  into  heaven  from  Mount  Olivet,  He  left  the  marks  of 
His  feet  there.  This  is  what  Adrichomius  says,  in  his  “ Description 
of  the  Holy  Land,”  on  the  word  “the  Leap  of  the  Lord  “The 
tradition  is  that  Christ  fled  to  a high  mountain,  which  is  called  from 
that  circumstance  ( the  Leap  of  the  Lord/  and  that,  at  the  touch 
of  His  garment,  the  rock  flowed,  and  being  melted  and  loosened 
like  wax,  made  a kind  of  hollow  for  the  Lord's  body  to  be  received 
in  and  protected,  a hollow  of  a capacity  equal  to  the  quantity  of 
the  Lord's  body.  And  in  this,  even  at  the  present  day,  the  linea- 
ments and  folds  of  the  garment  on  the  Lord's  back,  and  the  marks 
of  His  feet,  are  preserved,  marked  out  as  though  by  the  hand  of  a 
sculptor.”  This,  however,  lacks  confirmation.

( 1 7*  ) 


CHAPTER  V. 

I  Christ  teacheth  the  people  out  of  Peter’s  ship.  4 In  a miraculous  taking  of  fishes , 
sheweth  how  he  will  make  him  and  his  partners  fishers  of  men . 12  Cleanseth 

the  leper.  16  Prayeth  in  the  wilderness . 1 8 Healeth  one  sick  of  the  palsy. 

27  Calleth  Matthew  the  publican . 29  Eateth  with  sinners , as  being  the  physician 
of  souls.  34  Foretelleth  the  fastings  and  affitciions  of  the  apostles  after  his 
ascension.  36  And  likeneth  faint-hearted  and  weak  disciples  to  old  bottles  and 
worn  garments. 

A ND  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  the  people  pressed  upon  him  'o  hear  the  word  of 
^ God,  he  stood  by  the  lake  of  Gennesaret, 

2 And  saw  two  ships  standing  by  the  lake  : but  the  fishermen  were  gone  out 
of  them,  and  were  washing  their  nets. 

3 And  he  entered  into  one  of  the  ships,  which  was  Simon’s,  and  prayed  him 
that  he  would  thrust  out  a little  from  the  land.  And  he  sat  down,  and  taught 
the  people  out  of  the  ship. 

4 Now  when  he  had  left  speaking,  he  said  unto  Simon,  Launch  out  into  the 
deep,  and  let  down  your  nets  for  a draught. 

5 And  Simon  answering  said  unto  him,  Master,  we  have  toiled  all  the  night, 
and  have  taken  nothing  : nevertheless  at  thy  word  I will  let  down  the  net. 

6 And  when  they  had  this  done,  they  inclosed  a great  multitude  of  fishes : and 
their  net  brake. 

7 And  they  beckoned  unto  their  partners,  which  were  in  the  other  ship,  that 
they  should  come  and  help  them.  And  they  came,  and  filled  both  the  ships,  so 
that  they  began  to  sink. 

8 When  Simon  Peter  saw  it,  he  fell  down  at  Jesus’  knees,  saying,  Depart  from 
me ; for  I am  a sinful  man,  O Lord. 

9 For  he  was  astonished,  and  all  that  were  with  him,  at  the  draught  of  the 
fishes  which  they  had  taken  : 

10  And  so  was  also  James,  and  John,  the  sons  of  Zebedee,  which  were  partners 
with  Simon.  And  Jesus  said  unto  Simon,  Fear  not : from  henceforth  thou  shalt 
catch  men. 

11  And  when  they  had  brought  their  ships  to  land,  they  forsook  all,  and  fol- 
lowed him. 

12  And  it  came  to  pass,  when  he  was  in  a certain  city,  behold  a man  full  of 
leprosy  : who  seeing  Jesus  fell  on  his  face,  and  besought  him,  saying,  Lord,  if  thou 
wilt,  thou  canst  make  me  clean. 

13  And  he  put  forth  his  hand,  and  touched  him,  saying,  I will : be  thou  clean. 
And  immediately  the  leprosy  departed  from  him.

S LUKE,  C.  V. 


14  And  he  charged  him  to  tell  no  man  : but  go,  and  shew  thyself  to  the  priest, 
and  offer  for  thy  cleansing,  according  as  Moses  commanded,  for  a testimony  unto 
them. 

15  But  so  much  the  more  went  there  a fame  abroad  of  him  : and  great  multi- 
tudes came  together  to  hear,  and  to  be  healed  by  him  of  their  infirmities. 

16  And  he  withdrew  himself  into  the  wilderness,  and  prayed. 

17  And  it  came  to  pass  on  a certain  day,  as  he  was  teaching,  that  there  were 
Pharisees  and  doctors  of  the  law  sitting  by,  which  were  come  out  of  every  town 
of  Galilee,  and  Judaea,  and  Jerusalem  : and  the  power  of  the  Lord  was  present  to 
heal  them. 

18  And,  behold,  men  brought  in  a bed  a man  which  was  taken  with  a palsy : 
and  they  sought  means  to  bring  him  in,  and  to  lay  him  before  him. 

19  And  when  they  could  not  find  by  what  way  they  might  bring  him  in  because 
of  the  multitude,  they  went  upon  the  housetop,  and  let  him  down  through  the 
tiling  with  his  couch  into  the  midst  before  Jesus. 

20  And  when  he  saw  their  faith,  he  said  unto  him,  Man,  thy  sins  are  forgiven 
thee. 

21  And  the  scribes  and  the  Pharisees  began  to  reason,  saying,  Who  is  this  which 
speaketh  blasphemies?  Who  can  forgive  sins,  but  God  alone? 

22  But  when  Jesus  perceived  their  thoughts,  he  answering  said  unto  them, 
What  reason  ye  in  your  hearts  ? 

23  Whether  is  easier,  to  say,  Thy  sins  be  forgiven  thee ; or  to  say,  Rise  up  and 
walk? 

24  But  that  ye  may  know  that  the  Son  of  man  hath  power  upon  earth  to  for- 
give sins  (he  said  unto  the  sick  of  the  palsy),  I say  unto  thee,  Arise,  and  take  up 
thy  couch,  and  go  into  thine  house. 

25  And  immediately  he  rose  up  before  them,  and  took  up  that  whereon  he  lay, 
and  departed  to  his  own  house,  glorifying  God. 

26  And  they  were  all  amazed,  and  they  glorified  God,  and  were  filled  with 
fear,  saying,  We  have  seen  strange  things  to  day. 

27  And  after  these  things  he  went  forth,  and  saw  a publican,  named  Levi, 
sitting  at  the  receipt  of  custom  : and  he  said  unto  him,  Follow  me. 

28  And  he  left  all,  rose  up,  and  followed  him. 

29  And  Levi  made  him  a great  feast  in  his  own  house : and  there  was  a great 
company  of  publicans  and  of  others  that  sat  down  with  them. 

30  But  their  scribes  and  Pharisees  murmured  against  his  disciples,  saying,  Why 
do  ye  eat  and  drink  with  publicans  and  sinners? 

31  And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  them,  They  that  are  whole  need  not  a 
physician  ; but  they  that  are  sick. 

32  I came  not  to  call  the  righteous,  but  sinners  to  repentance. 

33  And  they  said  unto  him,  Why  do  the  disciples  of  John  fast  often,  and 
make  prayers,  and  likewise  the  disciples  of  the  Pharisees;  but  thine  eat  and 
drink? 

34  And  he  said  unto  them,  Can  ye  make  the  children  of  the  bride-chamber 
fast,  while  the  bridegroom  is  with  them  ? 

35  But  the  days  will  come,  when  the  bridegroom  shall  be  taken  away  from 
them,  and  then  shall  they  fast  in  those  days. 

36  And  he  spake  also  a parable  unto  them ; No  man  putteth  a piece  of  a

new  garment  upon  an  old  $ if  otherwise,  then  both  the  new  maketh  a rent,  and 
the  piece  that  was  taken  out  of  the  new  agreeih  not  with  the  old. 

37  And  no  man  putteth  new  wine  into  old  bottles;  else  the  new  wine  will 
burst  the  bottles,  and  be  spilled,  and  the  bottles  shall  perish. 

38  But  new  wine  must  be  put  into  new  bottles  ; and  both  are  preserved. 

39  No  man  also  having  drunk  old  wine  straightway  desireth  new  : for  he  saith, 
The  old  is  better. 


Ver.  6. — They  inclosed  a great  multitude  of  fishes — for  Peter  had  said, 
“ At  Thy  word  I will  let  down  the  net.”  Behold  here  the  fruit  and 
reward  of  obedience.  Jesus  did  this — 1.  In  order  that  by  providing 
them  with  food,  He  might  prepare  them  for  their  vocation  and 
ministry.  I have  chosen  you  to  be  My  disciples,  make  not  excuse 
that  ye  must  work  for  your  livelihood  as  fishermen.  Behold  this 
miraculous  draft  of  fishes,  and  believe  that  I am  able  to  provide  you 
with  all  things  necessary  for  life  more  easily  and  more  abundantly 
than  ye  are  able  to  provide  them  yourselves.  2.  To  teach  from 
this  miracle,  that  they  were  soon  to  become  successful  fishers 
of  men. 

Ver.  7. — Ajid  they  beckoned  unto  their  partners — because  from  joy 
and  wondering  astonishment  they  were  unable  to  speak. 

Ver.  10. — Fear  not  (be  not  lost  in  astonishment,  from  henceforth 
you  are  to  be  fishermen  in  a higher  sense  of  the  word),  from  hence- 
forth thou  shalt  catch  men.  guyfut  from  which  means — 

First,  to  hunt  or  catch  some  living  thing,  hence  the  Arabic  trans- 
lates it,  from  henceforth  thou  shalt  be  a fisherman,  for  thou  shalt 
fish  for  and  take  men.  Thou,  Peter,  shalt  catch  men,  not  by 
wounding  and  disabling  them,  as  wild  animals  are  taken ; but  as  fish 
which  are  unhurt  by  the  net,  so  thou  shalt  catch  men  not  by  vio- 
lence or  force,  but  through  the  power  and  operation  of  the  spirit. 

Secondly  (if  we  derive  the  word  from  and  iy^o/iai  or  rytfyu), 
to  quicken,  or  recall  to  life.  Hence  S.  Ambrose  (Hexam.,  lib.  v. 
cap.  vi.)  “ Thou  shalt  be  a life-giver  to  men  and  the  Syriac,  “ Thou 
shalt  be  a fisher  of  men,  to  recall  them  to  life.”  Fishermen,  indeed, 
catch  fish  to  provide  themselves  with  food,  but  thou,  O Peter,  art  to 
become  a fisher  of  men,  not  to  destroy  them,  but  to  give  them  life 
by  raising  them  from  the  death  of  sin  unto  the  life  of  righteousness,

for  like  as  fish  taken  from  the  water  die,  so  men  caught  by  thee 
become  dead  indeed  unto  sin,  but  alive  unto  God,  and,  in  a sense, 
as  fish  are  assimilated  by  those  who  feed  on  them,  so  do  those  who 
are  inclosed  in  the  Gospel  net,  become  in  very  truth  members  of 
Christ  Figuratively,  the  ship  of  Peter  is  the  Church,  the  head 
of  which  is  Peter  and  his  successors.  The  Pope  is  therefore  the 
chief  fisherman  to  whom  the  words  of  Christ  apply,  “ Thou  shalt 
catch  men.”  It  is  the  duty,  therefore,  of  the  Roman  Pontiff  directly 
and  by  means  of  others  to  convert  the  heathen,  as  the  early  occu- 
pants of  the  see  of  Rome  converted  the  Roman  people  and  sent 
apostolic  men  to  preach  the  word  of  life  to  heathen  lands. 

Thus  S.  Gregory  sent  Augustine  to  convert  the  English  people. 

S.  Ambrose  observes,  that  some  men,  e.g.f  the  martyrs,  like  fish, 
are  taken  by  the  hook ; others,  />.,  the  body  of  the  faithful,  by  the 
net,  and  adds,  “ Nets  are  the  means  whereby  the  Apostles  catch 
men,  for  nets  do  not  destroy  but  preserve  what  they  take,  and  bring 
to  the  surface  that  which  is  floating  below.” 

Nets  are  called  in  Latin  “retia,”  because  they  are  retentive 
“ retinentia,”  of  that  which  they  have  taken. — Gloss. 

Ver.  32. — I came  not  to  call  the  righteous  but  sinners  to  repentance  ; 
i.e.y  to  call  them  by  means  of  repentance  to  grace  and  future  glory. 
Hence  as  S.  Ambrose  acutely  remarks,  “If  grace  flows  from  repent- 
ance, he  who  thinks  little  of  repentance  forfeits  grace.”

CHAPTER  VL 

I  Christ  reproveth  the  Pharisees'  blindness  about  the  observation  of  the  sabbath,  hr 
scripture , reason , and  miracle . 13  C hoc  set  h twelve  apostles.  17  Hoaleth  :he 

diseased.  20  Preachetk  to  his  disciples  be j ore  the  people  of  blessings  and  curses. 
27  How  we  must  love  our  enemies.  46  And  join  the  obedience  of  good  works  to 
the  hearing  of  the  word:  lest  in  the  evil  day  of  temptation  we  fall  like  an  house 
built  upon  the  face  of  the  earth , without  any  foundation. 

AND  it  came  to  pass  on  the  second  sabbath  after  the  first,  that  he  went  through 
the  corn  fields ; and  his  disciples  plucked  the  ears  of  corn,  and  did  eat, 
rubbing  them  in  their  hands. 

2  And  certain  of  the  Pharisees  said  unto  them.  Why  do  ye  that  which  is  not 
lawful  to  do  on  the  sabbath  days? 

3  And  Jesus  answering  them  said,  Hare  ye  not  read  so  much  as  this,  what 
David  did,  when  himself  was  an  hungered,  and  they  which  were  with  him ; 

4  How  he  went  into  the  house  oi  God,  and  did  take  and  eat  the  shewbread, 
and  gave  also  to  them  them  that  were  with  him  ; which  it  is  not  lawful  to  eat  but 
for  the  priests  alone? 

5  And  he  said  unto  them,  That  the  Son  of  man  is  Lord  also  of  the  sabbath. 

6  And  it  came  to  pass  also  on  another  sabbath,  that  he  entered  into  the  syna- 
gogue and  taught : and  there  was  a man  whose  right  hand  was  withered. 

7  And  the  scribes  and  Pharisees  watched  hitn,  whether  he  would  heal  on  the 
sabbath  day ; that  they  might  find  an  accusation  against  him. 

8  But  he  knew  their  thoughts,  and  said  to  the  man  which  had  the  withered 
hand.  Rise  up,  and  stand  forth  in  the  midst.  And  he  arose  and  stood  forth. 

9  Then  said  Jesus  unto  them,  I will  ask  you  one  thing ; Is  it  lawful  on  the 
sabbath  days  to  do  good,  or  to  do  evil  ? to  save  life,  or  to  destroy  it  t 

10  And  looking  round  about  upon  them  all,  he  said  unto  the  man,  Stretch  forth 
thy  hand.  And  he  did  so : and  his  hand  was  restored  whole  as  the  other. 

1 1  And  they  were  filled  with  madness ; and  communed  one  with  another  what 
they  might  do  to  Jesus. 

12  And  it  came  to  pass  in  those  days,  that  he  went  out  into  a mountain  to  pray, 
and  continued  all  night  in  prayer  to  God. 

13  And  when  it  was  day  he  called  unto  him  his  disciples  : and  of  them  he  chose 
twelve,  whom  also  he  named  apostles  ; 

14  Simon  (whom  he  also  named  Peter),  and  Andrew  his  brother,  James  and 
John,  Philip  and  Bartholomew, 

15  Matthew  and  Thomas,  James  the  son  of  Alphseus,  and  Simon  called  Zelotes, 
16  And  Judas  the  brother  of  James,  and  Judas  Iscariot,  which  also  was  the  traitor.

S.  LUKE,  C.  VI. 


17  And  he  came  down  with  them,  and  stood  in  the  plain,  and  the  company  of 
his  disciples,  and  a great  multitude  of  people  out  of  all  Judaea  and  Jerusalem, 
and  from  the  sea  coast  of  Tyre  and  Sidon,  which  came  to  hear  him,  and  to  be 
healed  of  their  diseases  ; 

18  And  they  that  were  vexed  with  unclean  spirits  : and  they  were  healed. 

19  And  the  whole  multitude  sought  to  touch  him  : for  there  went  virtue  out  of 
him,  and  healed  them  all. 

20  And  he  lifted  up  his  eyes  on  his  disciples,  and  said,  Blessed  be  ye  poor  : for 
yours  is  the  kingdom  of  God. 

21  Blessed  are  ye  that  hunger  now:  for  ye  shall  be  filled.  Blessed  are  ye  that 
weep  now  : for  ye  shall  laugh. 

22  Blessed  are  ye,  when  men  shall  hate  you,  and  when  they  shall  separate  you 
from  their  company , and  shall  reproach  you , and  cast  out  your  name  as  evil,  for 
the  Son  of  man’s  sake. 

23  Rejoice  ye  in  that  day,  and  leap  for  joy  : for,  behold,  your  reward  is  great 
in  heaven  : for  in  the  like  manner  did  their  fathers  unto  the  prophets. 

24  But  woe  unto  ye  that  are  rich  1 for  ye  have  received  your  consolation. 

25  Woe  unto  you  that  are  full  1 for  ye  shall  hunger.  Woe  unto  ye  that  laugh 
now  ! for  ye  shall  mourn  and  weep. 

26  Woe  unto  you,  when  all  men  shall  speak  well  of  you  1 for  so  did  their 
fathers  to  the  false  prophets. 

27  But  I say  unto  you  which  hear,  Love  your  enemies,  do  good  to  them  which 
hate  you, 

28  Bless  them  that  curse  you,  and  pray  for  them  which  despitefully  use  you. 

29  And  unto  him  that  smiteth  thee  on  the  one  cheek  offer  also  the  other ; and 
him  that  taketh  away  thy  cloke  forbid  not  to  take  thy  coat  also. 

30  Give  to  every  man  that  asketh  of  thee ; and  of  him  that  taketh  away  thy 
goods  ask  them  not  again. 

31  And  as  ye  would  that  men  should  do  to  you,  do  ye  also  to  them  likewise. 

32  For  if  ye  love  them  which  love  you,  what  thank  have  ye  ? for  sinners  also 
love  those  that  love  them. 

33  And  if  ye  do  good  to  them  which  do  good  to  you,  what  thank  have  ye?  for 
sinners  also  do  even  the  same. 

34  And  if  ye  lend  to  them  of  whom  ye  hope  to  receive,  what  thank  have  ye  ? for 
sinners  also  lend  to  sinners,  to  receive  as  much  again. 

35  But  love  ye  your  enemies,  and  do  good,  and  lend,  hoping  for  nothing  again  ; 
and  your  reward  shall  be  great,  and  ye  shall  be  the  children  of  the  Highest : for 
he  is  kind  unto  the  unthankful  and  to  the  evil. 

36  Be  ye  therefore  merciful,  as  your  Father  also  is  merciful. 

37  Judge  not,  and  ye  shall  not  be  judged : condemn  not,  and  ye  shall  not  be 
condemned  : forgive,  and  ye  shall  be  forgiven  : 

38  Give,  and  it  shall  be  given  unto  you ; good  measure,  pressed  down,  and 
shaken  together,  and  running  over,  shall  men  give  into  your  bosom.  For  with 
the  same  measure  that  ye  mete  withal  it  shall  be  measured  to  you  again. 

39  And  he  spake  a parable  unto  them,  Can  the  blind  lead  the  blind?  shall  they 
not  both  fall  into  the  ditch  ? 

40  The  disciple  is  not  above  his  master  : but  every  one  that  is  perfect  shall  be 
as  his  master.

“THE  SECOND  SABBATH  AFTER  THE  FIRST.”  1 77 

41  And  why  beholdest  thou  the  mote  that  is  in  thy  brother’s  eye,  but  perceivest 
not  the  beam  that  is  in  thine  own  eye  ? 

42  Either  how  canst  thou  say  to  thy  brother,  Brother,  let  me  pull  out  the  mote 
that  is  in  thine  eye,  when  thou  thyself  beholdest  not  the  beam  that  is  in  thine  own 
eye?  Thou  hypocrite,  cast  out  first  the  beam  out  of  thine  own  eye,  and  then  shalt 
thou  see  clearly  to  pull  out  the  mote  that  is  in  thy  brother’s  eye. 

43  For  a good  tree  bringeth  not  forth  corrupt  fruit ; neither  doth  a corrupt  tree 
bring  forth  good  fruit 

44  For  every  tree  is  known  by  his  own  fruit.  For  of  thorns  men  do  not  gather 
figs,  nor  of  a bramble  bush  gather  they  grapes. 

45  A good  man  out  of  the  good  treasure  of  his  heart  bringeth  forth  that  which 
is  good  ; and  an  evil  man  out  of  the  evil  treasure  of  his  heart  bringeth  forth  that 
which  is  evil : for  of  the  abundance  of  the  heart  his  mouth  speaketh. 

46  And  why  call  ye  me,  Lord,  Lord,  and  do  not  the  things  which  I say? 

47  Whosoever  cometh  to  me,  and  heareth  my  sayings,  and  doeth  them,  I will 
shew  you  to  whom  he  is  like  : 

48  He  is  like  a man  which  built  an  house,  and  digged  deep,  and  laid  the  founda- 
tion on  a rock : and  when  the  flood  arose,  the  stream  beat  vehemently  upon  that 
house,  and  could  not  shake  it : for  it  was  founded  upon  a rock. 

49  But  he  that  heareth,  and  doeth  not,  is  like  a man  that  without  a foundation 
built  an  house  upon  the  earth ; against  which  the  stream  did  beat  vehemently,  and 
immediately  it  fell ; and  the  ruin  of  that  house  was  great 

Ver.  1. — And  it  came  to  pass  on  the  second  Sabbath  after  the  first — 
On  the  second  Sabbath.  The  Arabic  version. 

What  was  this  Sabbath  ? 

1.  The  eighth  day  of  unleavened  bread  or  the  last  day  of  the 
Passover.  Epiphanius,  Vetablus,  and  others. 

2.  The  first  day  of  unleavened  bread  or  the  second  day  of  the 
Passover,  and  therefore  both  the  first  and  second  Sabbath  or 
Feast-day.  Isidore,  Euthymius,  and  another. 

3.  The  Feast  of  Pentecost.  The  second  or  next  greatest  to  the 
Passover.  Maldonatus. 

4.  I however  consider  that  this  Sabbath  was  not  a feast, 
but  a Sabbath  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  word,  i.e.  a day  on 
which  the  Jews  were  forbidden  even  to  prepare  their  food  (Ex. 
xxxv.  3),  which  they  were  permitted  to  do  on  other  feasts  (Ex. 
xii.  16). 

That  this  is  the  true  interpretation  is  clear  from  the  other 
Evangelists,  who  speak  of  this  day  as  simply  a Sabbath. 

(In  accordance  with  A Lapide  the  Revised  Version  reads,  “Now 

it  came  to  pass  on  a Sabbath.”)

But  why  is  this  Sabbath  called  the  second  after  the  first? 

1.  Because  it  followed  on  a feast  (Theophylact) ; or,  as  others 
hold,  because  it  was  followed  by  a feast,  and  thus  became  the 
first  before  the  second,  which  was  close  at  hand. 

2.  Scaliger  considers  it  to  be  the  first  Sabbath  after  the  Feast 
of  the  Passover,  called  the  second  after  the  first,  because  it 
was  the  first  after  the  second  day  of  unleavened  bread,  from 
which  day  was  numbered  the  seven  weeks  to  Pentecost  So  also 
Vasquez. 

3.  S.  Chrysostom  and  others  think  the  words  imply  a feast  or 
Sabbath  in  a twofold  sense,  a day  on  which  another  feast-day 
falls,  and  that  they  convey  the  same  meaning  as  the  Latin  word 
“ duplitia  ; ” but  to  this  interpretation  Jansenius  objects. 

4.  But  it  is  most  probable  that  the  words  mean  the  Sabbath 
which  fell  within  the  week  of  Pentecost  or  on  the  Feast-day  itself. 
The  Pascal  Sabbath  being  distinguished  as  the  first  or  principal 
Sabbath  of  the  whole  year.  S.  John  xix.  31. 

(1.)  This  opinion  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  what  is  here 
narrated  of  the  disciples  must  have  happened  about  the  time  of 
Pentecost,  ue.  when  the  com  was  ripe.  Hence  the  command  to 
the  Jews  to  offer  their  firstfruits,  Lev.  xxiii.  17. 

(2.)  And  because,  as  I have  showed,  this  was  a Sabbath  in  the 
strict  sense  of  the  word,  and  was  called  second,  in  respect  of  some 
other  Sabbath  which  held  rank  as  the  first,  and  not  with  any 
reference  to  the  Passover  or  any  other  feast 

(3).  Because,  again,  none  of  the  other  opinions  seem  to  be  prob- 
able. For,  to  sum  up,  the  Feasts  of  the  Passover  and  Pentecost 
are  so  nearly  connected,  that,  although  one  is  first  in  dignity  and 
order,  the  second  follows  in  all  respects  closely  upon  it.  For  this 
reason  the  Italians  call  Pentecost  the  Passover  of  the  Holy  Ghost 
The  same  may  be  said  also  of  the  Sabbaths  which  fall  within  these 
feasts ; therefore  the  Church  numbers  her  Sundays  from  Easter 
to  Pentecost,  and  from  the  latter  festival  to  Advent. 

But  you  will  object  that  the  week  of  Pentecost  was  not  a feast 
in  the  same  sense  as  the  week  of  the  Passover  2 therefore  that  the

Sabbath  which  fell  in  it  was  not  of  more  importance  than  any 
other.  I answer  that  although  the  Pentecostal  week  was  not  com- 
manded by  the  law  to  be  kept  as  a feast,  it  was  so  kept  by  the 
piety  of  the  Jews.  Genebrardus’  Hebrew  Calendar,  and  on  the 
Psalms. 

Figuratively , says  S.  Ambrose,  we  may  understand  this  Sabbath 
to  mean  the  Gospel,  which  is  second  to  the  law  in  point  of  time, 
but  first  in  dignity  and  importance. 

He  further  adds,  commenting  on  Ps.  xlvii.,  the  words  4<  second 
Sabbath  after  the  first”  mean  the  Jewish  Sabbath,  for  after  the 
resurrection  the  Lord’s-day  took  its  place.  From  that  time  there- 
fore it  became  second  in  dignity,  yet  at  the  same  time  it  was  rightly 
called  first,  because  of  its  sanctity  and  the  priority  of  its  institution. 

Figuratively , Christ  taught  and  worked  His  chief  miracles  on 
the  Sabbath,  not  only  to  prefigure  the  spiritual  Sabbath,  when 
the  mind,  no  longer  taken  up  with  evil  lusts  and  passions,  will  be 
free  to  serve  God  alone,  but  because  of  the  gathering  together  of 
the  people,  as  they  assemble  now  on  the  Lord’s-day. 

There  was  also  another  reason,  viz.,  to  teach  the  Jews  the  true 
observance  of  the  Sabbath,  and  that  they  might  no  longer  be 
offended  at  the  wonderful  works  which  Christ  wrought  on  that  day, 
as  were  the  Scribes,  who  accused  Him  of  transgressing  the  law, 
and  gave  Him  up  to  that  death  by  means  of  which  God  effected 
the  redemption  of  mankind.  Bede. 

Ver.  5. — The  Son  of  man  is  Lord  also  of  the  Sabbath.  See 
S.  Matt,  xil  8. 

Ver.  11. — And  they  were  filled  with  madness,  a niag,  deprived 
of  understanding,  they  could  not  answer  Him  a word  ; they  were 
filled  with  anger  because  they  could  not  gainsay  the  reasoning  of 
Christ,  and  with  envy,  as  the  Syriac  renders  it,  which  was  the  cause 
of  their  madness.  Their  eyes  were  blinded  so  that  they  could  not 
see  the  truth ! Hence  Francis  Lucas  adds,  they  communed  one 
with  another  what  they  might  do  with  Jesus,  i.e.  how  they  tnight 
make  away  with  Him. 

Ver.  12. — He  went  out  into  a mountain  to  fray,  and  continued  all

night  in  prayer  to  God — communing  with  God  in  prayer,  asking 
the  Father  that  He  might  choose  for  the  ministry  men  fitted  to  be 
apostles,  and  would  obtain  for  them  an  abundance  of  spiritual  grace 
to  enable  them  to  fulfil  the  duties  of  their  office ; and  also  that  He 
might  teach  us  to  pray  in  like  manner. 

So  the  Church  at  Ember-tide  enjoins  her  children  to  fast  and 
to  pray  that  fitting  persons  may  be  chosen  for  the  work  of  the 
ministry,  and  that  those  admitted  to  any  holy  function  may  be 
filled  with  grace  and  heavenly  benediction ; for  as  with  the  priest 
so  with  the  people.  When  a chief  pastor  is  zealous  and  God- 
fearing, he  is  a blessing  and  a strength  to  his  diocese,  but  if  he  be 
an  evil  liver  or  slothful,  he  becomes  a stumbling-block  and  offence 
to  believers.  In  like  manner,  also,  a good  priest  makes  a good 
parish,  but  an  evil  one  is  for  a destruction  to  his  people. 

Figuratively , Christ  teaches  us  to  pray  in  the  night  season  that 
we  may  be  the  better  able  in  silence  and  solitude  to  collect  our 
thoughts  and  lift  our  hearts  unto  God ; that  we  may  be  preserved 
from  terror  by  night  and  from  the  pestilence  that  walketh  in  dark- 
ness, and  also  that  by  our  prayers  during  the  night  we  may 
obtain  spiritual  graces  for  the  profit  of  our  fellow-men  during  the 
ensuing  day. 

Hence  Christ  prayed  by  night  and  taught  in  the  daytime.  So 
did  S.  Paul,  Acts  xvi.  25  ; and  many  other  saints ; 1 Tim.  v.  5. 

For  the  same  reason  David  so  often  commends  prayer  during 
the  night  time,  “ Ye  that  by  night  stand  in  the  house  of  the  Lord. 
Lift  up  your  hands  in  the  sanctuary,”  Ps.  cxxxiv.  1,  2. 

“ At  midnight  I will  rise  to  give  thanks  unto  Thee,”  Ps.  cxix.  62. 

“ In  the  night  I commune  with  mine  own  heart,”  Ps.  lxxvii.  6. 

“ My  tears  have  been  my  meat  day  and  night,”  Ps.  xlii.  3. 

See  also  Commentary  on  Deut  vi.  7. 

Ver.  20. — Blessed  are  ye  poor  ...  in  spirit  (see  S.  Matt  v.  3),  for 
poorness  of  spirit  is  a rich  and  precious  virtue.  Therefore  S. 
Ambrose  rightly  concludes  that  poverty,  privations,  and  sorrow, 
which  the  world  counts  evil,  not  only  are  no  hindrances,  but  on  the 
contrary  have  been  declared  by  Him  who  could  neither  deceive

THE  FOUR  BEATITUDES.

nor  be  deceived,  to  be  of  great  assistance  towards  the  attainment 
of  a holy  and  a happy  life. 

The  same  writer  goes  on  to  give  the  reason  why  S.  Luke  has 
reduced  the  number  of  the  beatitudes  to  four.  He  was  content 
that  they  should  include  the  four  cardinal  virtues.  Justice,  which, 
coveting  not  the  possessions  of  others,  rejoices  in  holy  poverty; 
temperance,  which  had  rather  suffer  want  than  be  full;  prudence, 
which  chooses  to  sorrow  here,  in  hope  of  the  joy  which  shall  be 
revealed ; and  Fortitude,  which  for  sake  of  Christ  and  His  Gospel, 
endures  persecution  and  so  triumphs  over  every  enemy.  Hence 
we  read  that  the  poor,  the  temperate,  those  who  hunger  and  thirst 
after  righteousness  (S.  Matthew),  the  just,  those  who  weep,  the 
prudent  who  despise  earthly  things  and  seek  heavenly,  those  hated 
of  their  fellowmen,  not  because  of  any  misdeeds  but  for  the  Gospel’s 
sake,  who,  steadfast  in  the  faith,  seek  for  future  happiness  by 
pleasing  God  rather  than  men — that  these  are  indeed  blessed. 

Ver.  24. — But  woe  unto  you  that  are  rich , for  ye  have  received 
your  consolation.  To  the  four  beatitudes  Christ,  by  antithesis, 
opposes  as  many  states  of  misery  and  unhappiness. 

The  poor  are  blessed  for  all  eternity,  but  the  rich  receive  in 
this  world  their  consolation ; the  hungry  shall  be  satisfied  with  good 
things,  but  those  that  are  full  now  shall  be  sent  empty  away.  They 
who  weep  here  shall  hereafter  rejoice,  but  for  those  who  laugh  now 
there  is  reserved  a future  of  mourning ; and  those  that  are  spoken 
well  of  by  their  fellow  men,  are  laying  up  lor  themselves  an  eternity 
of  woe. 

For  Oual,  Latin  vcc,  as  S.  Gregory  points  out  (Horn.  ix.  on 
Ezekiel),  oftentimes  in  Scripture  denotes  the  wrath  of  God  and 
everlasting  punishment.  Hence  this  word  is  here  used  by  Christ 
partly  as  a lament  over  the  future  and  eternal  misery  of  the  worldly, 
(S.  Chrysostom,  Horn.  44  ad  pop.)',  partly  as  a prophecy  of  it  (Titus) ; 
partly  as  threatening  and  decreeing  such  punishment  against  them 
(Tertullian,  bk.  iv.  against  Marcian). 

You  that  are  rich.  As  by  poor  we  understand  those  poor  in 
spirit  who  love  poverty  because  thereby  they  are  the  better  able  to

S.  LUKE,  C.  VI. 


please  God,  so  we  may  take  the  word  rich  to  mean  those  who, 
greedy  of  gain,  heap  up  riches  by  any  means  in  their  power,  and 
look  upon  wealth  as  their  sole  happiness  and  the  one  object  of 
their  life.  Hence  mortal  sin,  robbery,  extortion,  unfair  dealing,  and 
other  such  like  sins.  Therefore  the  denunciation  of  Christ.  But 
those  who  are  rich  by  inheritance  and  honest  labour,  as  long  as  they 
are  not  corrupted  by  their  riches,  but  use  them  for  the  glory  of 
God  and  the  good  of  their  fellow  men,  in  reality  are  poor,  as  were 
the  patriarchs,  David,  and  many  other  of  the  saints  of  old. 

For  it  is  not  the  amount  he  possesses,  but  the  use  a man  makes 
of  his  riches  which  is  accounted  sin.  So  “they  that  will  be  rich 
fall  into  temptation  and  a snare,  and  into  many  foolish  and  hurtful 
lusts,  which  drown  men  in  destruction  and  perdition.  For  the 
love  of  money  is  the  root  of  all  evil.”  See  i Tim.  vi.  9. 

Ye  have  received  your  consolation, . Ye  set  your  heart  on  your 
riches,  use  them  for  your  own  evil  gratification,  and  put  them  in 
the  place  of  your  God.  Therefore  ye  are  allowed  the  enjoyment  of 
them  in  this  life,  but  in  the  life  which  is  to  come  ye  will,  as  Christ 
has  here  declared,  come  short  of  everlasting  happiness,  for  those 
who  have  in  this  world  received  their  consolation  will  lose  their 
eternal  reward. 

Hence  S.  Hieronymus  ( Epist \ xxxiv.),  when  endeavouring  to  per- 
suade Julian,  a rich  nobleman,  to  give  up  the  world  and  devote 
himself  to  a holy  and  religious  life,  uses  this  powerful  argument 
“ It  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible,”  he  says,  “ to  enjoy  happiness  in 
both  worlds — to  give  ourselves  up  to  our  evil  lusts  and  passions 
here,  but  to  become  spiritually  minded  after  death — to  pass  from 
one  state  of  happiness  to  the  other— to  acquire  glory  both  in  this 
world  and  in  the  next,  . . . and  to  be  distinguished  equally  in 
heaven  and  on  earth.  Hence  Abraham  returned  none  other 
answer  to  the  rich  man  than  this,  ‘ Son,  remember  that  thou  in  thy 
lifetime  receivedst  thy  good  things,  and  likewise  Lazarus  evil 
things,  but  now  he  is  comforted  and  thou  art  tormented.*”  See 
chapter  xvi.  25. 

So  also  Christ  is  said  to  hkve  offered  S.  Catherine  of  Siena  two

crowns,  one  set  with  jewels,  the  other  begirt  with  thorns,  bidding 
her  choose  which  she  would  wear  in  this  life,  which  in  the  life  to 
come.  She  chose  the  thorny  crown,  and,  regardless  of  the  anguish* 
pressed  it  firmly  on  her  head 

Ver.  25. — Woe  unto  you  which  are  fully  &c. — ye  who  live  only 
for  eating  and  drinking,  for  ye  shall  hunger  in  eternity. 

Actual  evil-doers  will  indeed  endure  heavier  punishment;  but 
those  who  are  gluttonous  will  suffer  torment  from  the  absence  of 
those  things  wherein  they  delighted.  Hence  Dives  prayed  for  but 
one  drop  of  water  to  cool  the  tongue  which  he  had  accustomed  to 
the  richest  food  and  the  choicest  wine.  S.  Euthymius. 

For,  as  S.  Basil  writes,  to  live  for  pleasure  alone  is  but  to  make  a 
God  of  one’s  belly  (Phil.  iii.  19).  From  the  one  vice  of  gluttony 
spring  innumerable  others  which  war  against  the  soul.  Subdue  then 
this  one  vice,  and  you  will  at  the  same  time  subdue  many  others,  for 
innumerable  are  the  promptings  of  lust,  which  following  in  the  train 
of  gluttony,  hold  out  promise  of  enjoyment,  but  lead  to  everlasting 
misery.  S.  Gregory  in  lib . regurrty  lib . v.  cap . 1. 

The  mind  which  is  always  accustomed  to  pleasure,  and  never 
weeded  of  evil  by  discipline,  contracts  much  moral  defilement 
(S.  Bernard,  Epist.  152);  and  again  (Semi.  48,  in  Cant .),  “ A liie  spent 
in  pleasure  is  both  death  and  the  shadow  of  death,  for  as  a shadow 
follows  close  on  that  by  which  it  is  cast,  a life  of  pleasure,  beyond 
dispute,  borders  on  destruction.” 

On  the  contrary,  fasting  and  abstinence  give  rise  to  chaste  thoughts, 
reasonable  desires  and  healthful  counsels,  for  by  voluntary  self- 
denial  the  flesh  is  mortified  and  spiritual  virtues  are  strengthened 
and  renewed.  S.  Leo,  (serin.  n,  dejejunio). 

Hence  Christ  gave  S.  Catherine  this  rule  of  life,  “ Choose  that 
which  is  bitter  as  sweet,  avoid  that  which  is  sweet  as  bitter.”  See 
also  Eccles.  ii.  1. 

Woe  unto  you  which  laugh  nowy  for  ye  shall  mourn  and  weep — in 
this  life,  and  much  more  in  the  life  to  come  S.  Basil  seems  in  his 
rules  to  forbid  all  laughter,  because  this  is  a life  of  penitence  and 
sorrow,  but  the  future  one  of  joy  and  gladness.  Certain  it  is,  as  S.

Augustine  points  out,  that  Christ  is  never  said  to  have  laughed, 
although  He  often  wept 

Mirth  in  moderation,  however,  is  not  forbidden  to  the  followers  of 
Christ  “ A fool  lifteth  up  his  voice  with  laughter,  but  a wise  man 
doth  scarce  smile  a little”  (Ecclus.  xxi.  20);  and  (Eccles.  ii.  2),  “I 
said  of  laughter,  It  is  mad : and  of  mirth,  What  doeth  it  ?”  Comment- 
ing on  which  passages,  I have  shown  that  it  is  immoderate  laughter 
which  is  condemned,  and  not  that  moderate  mirth  which  is  the  mark 
of  a kindly  disposition  and  well-regulated  mind. 

Woe  to  you  that  laugh,  i.e.  to  you  who  laugh  with  the  drunken, 
and  make  merry  over  sinful  enjoyment,  for  you  will  weep  and 
lament  for  ever  in  helL 

Ver.  26. — Woe  unto  you  when  all  men  shall  speak  well  of  you,  &c 
When  men,  who  for  the  most  part  are  carnally  minded,  speak  well 
of  you  as  setters  forth  of  that  which  is  pleasing  to  their  ears,  for 
they  hate  the  truth,  and  persecute  those  who  rebuke  vice  and 
restrain  the  evildoer,  but  praise  them  who  excuse  iniquity,  whom 
God  abhors.  Thus  did  their  forefathers  speak  well  of  the  false 
prophets  of  old,  and  therefore  they  all  have  entered  into  condemna- 
tion. I also  condemn  you  inasmuch  as  ye  follow  after  their  example. 
This  “woe”  is  the  contrary  to  the  blessing  promised  to  the  true 
prophets,  who  for  the  gospel's  sake  endure  persecution,  v.  22.  So 
S.  Paul : “ If  I pleased  men,  I should  not  be  the  servant  of  Christ.” 
See  Gal.  L 10.  For  he  who  preaches  false  doctrine  and  things 
pleasing  to  the  carnal  mind,  causes  his  hearers  to  continue  in 
wickedness  and  commit  many  sins,  and  therefore  will  receive  greater 
damnation. 

Again,  the  preacher  who  seeks  the  applause  rather  than  the  con- 
version of  his  hearers,  and  looks  upon  this  as  the  end  and  object  of 
his  ministry,  will  be  condemned ; because  he  sought  to  obtain  the 
praise  of  men  rather  than  to  advance  the  glory  of  God,  and  made 
the  vainglory  of  the  world  the  one  object  of  his  life,  thus  destroying 
the  souls  of  those  committed  to  his  care. 

Such  were  the  false  teachers  whom  Jeremiah  and  the  other 
prophets  so  t)ften  were  called  upon  to  refute.  “The  prophets

prophesy  falsely,  and  the  priests  bear  rule  by  their  means,  and  my 
people  love  to  have  it  so,”  Jer.  v.  31. 

Ver.  27. — But  I say  unto  you  which  hear,  Love  your  enemies. 
Christ,  after  solemnly  warning  those  who  live  for  pleasure  alone, 
now  addresses  His  own  disciples.  “ I have  denounced  woe  against 
the  wicked,  but  to  you  who  hear  my  words,  and  seek  the  salvation 
of  your  souls,  I give  as  a first  and  chief  commandment  that  you 
should  love  your  enemies.”  See  S.  Matt  v.  44. 

Ver.  30. — Give  to  every  man  that  asketh  of  thee . Not  only  if  he 
is  in  want  of  the  necessaries  of  life,  but  if  he  needs  counsel,  advice, 
or  aid  of  any  kind,  for  thus  ye  will  be  showing  mercy  and  pity  both 
to  the  souls  and  bodies  of  your  fellow  men.  See  S.  Matt  v.  42. 
S.  Luke  here  adds  the  words  “ to  every  man,”  which  S.  Matt  omits, 
from  which  we  are  to  understand  that  we  are  to  give  as  far  as  we 
honestly  and  rightly  can  to  every  one  that  asketh,  but  not  to  one 
that  asketh  for  anything  or  everything.  For  a man  may  ask  us  to 
give  him  money  for  a wrongful  purpose,  or  even  to  commit  actual 
sin.  Hence  we  are  only  bound  to  give  that  which,  as  far  as  we 
know,  will  neither  be  hurtful  to  ourselves,  or  to  him  that  receiveth 
the  gift:  and  in  case  we  refuse  to  give,  we  must  justify  our  refusal, 
so  that  he  who  asks  may  not  go  discontented  away. 

To  every  one  therefore  that  asketh  of  thee,  give  not  always  that 
which  he  asks,  but  oftentimes  that  which  is  better — a denial  if  the 
request  is  one  which  we  can  show  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  comply 
with.  S.  Augustine. 

And  of  him  that  taketh  away  thy  goods , ask  them  not  again , 
neither  by  power  of  law  or  in  any  other  way,  as  S.  Augustine 
explains.  Which  is  a command,  in  the  case  of  one  who,  under 
pressure  of  want,  has  despoiled  thee,  but  is  otherwise  a counsel. 
So  we  read,  “Ye  exact  all  your  labours,”  Isa,  lviii.  3. 

And  again  in  the  parable,  the  unmerciful  servant,  because  he  had 
no  pity,  was  delivered  to  the  tormentors  until  he  should  pay  all  the 
debt  which  had  been  forgiven  him.  S.  Matt,  xviii.  So  Spiridion, 


S.  LUKE,  C.  VI. 


1 86 

Ver.  34. — And  if  ye  lend  to  them  of  whom  ye  hope  to  receive  (a  like 
benefit),  what  thank  have  ye?”  For  this  is  not  kindness  but  com- 
merce, the  exchange  of  kindness  for  kindness.  Ye  give  for  what  ye 
hope  to  receive,  not  for  love  of  God ; and  thus  the  hope  of  a return 
of  the  benefit  conferred  deprives  the  act  of  the  favour  ot  God. 
Interlinear  Gloss. 

Ver.  35. — Lend , hoping  for  nothing  again . “ From  men,”  adds 

the  Syriac,  “ that  you  may  receive  your  reward  of  God.” 

Nothing,  i.e.  no  pledge  or  return  of  any  kind.  Christ  would 
have  us  lend,  not  only  without  exacting  usury  for  the  loan,  but  also 
without  expecting  a similar  kindness  in  return.  For  what  is  it  but 
self-seeking  and  avarice,  if  I lend  to  another  that  he  in  his  turn  may 
lend  to  me  ? Christ  here  enjoins  the  true  benevolence  which  lends 
freely,  content  that  at  the  appointed  time  the  loan  should  be 
returned.  Some,  indeed,  think  that  there  should  be  no  return,  but 
the  words  of  Christ  do  not  bear  this  construction.  For  that  which 
is  lent  without  expectation  of  return,  is  given,  not  lent,  and  becomes 
not  a loan  but  a gift.  Toletus,  Lessius,  Valentia,  and  others. 

Hence  to  seek  to  profit  by  a loan  is  contrary  to  the  meaning  of 
the  word  and  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  For  the  word  mutuum 
(in  the  Greek  danifyn,  mutuum  date , Vulgate),  implies  that  they 
are  mutuo  animo , who  give  because  of  duty  (Varro) ; or,  as  Verius 
Marcellus  better  explains  it,  mutuum  means  the  same  as  meum 
tuum , because  out  of  friendly  feeling  mine  becomes  thine  for 
present  needs  and  necessities.  Hence  S.  Gregory  Nyssen.  writes, 
“ He  who  exacts  interest  on  a loan,  is  condemned  as  a usurer;”  for 
a loan  is  a friendly  transaction,  freely  given  and  to  be  freely 
restored.  Cicero,  Epist.  ad  Metellum . 

A kindly-hearted  man,  therefore,  will  lend  to  him  who  is  in  need, 
even  though  he  may  have  reason  to  believe  he  will  never  be  repaid, 
for  there  are  many  poor  who  cannot,  and  many  unworthy  persons 
who  will  not  return  that  which  is  lent  them. 

Hence  a witty  writer,  “If  you  lend  to  your  friend  and  ask  a 
return  of  the  loan,  you  will  lose  either  the  one  or  the  other;”  and 
again,  “By  lending  money,  I have  purchased  to  myself  an  enemy

ALMSGIVING  ENRICHES.  187 

and  lost  a friend.”  He  therefore  who  lends  should  lend  for  the 
love  of  God,  who  will  richly  repay,  as  is  written,  “ He  that  hath  pity 
on  the  poor  lendeth  unto  the  Lord.”  See  Prov.  xix.  17. 

Hence  S.  Chrysostom : “ The  poor  receive  the  gift,  but  God 
becomes  the  debtor ; * and  S.  Basil  (cone,  4 dc  Eleemosyna)  “ That 
which  thou  art  about  to  give  to  the  poor  for  the  love  of  God, 
becomes  both  a gift  and  a loan, — a gift,  because  there  is  no  expec- 
tation of  return — a loan,  because  of  the  goodness  of  God,  who  will 
richly  recompense  in  their  name  those  who  have  relieved  the  neces- 
sities of  the  poor.” 

Wherefore  we  may  take  in  a Christian  sense  that  which  is  written  : 
“ Lose  thy  money  for  thy  brother  and  thy  friend.”  See  Ecclus. 
xxix.  10,  and  my  comments  thereon.  But  when  men  take  that 
which  is  lent,  without  a thought  of  returning  it,  no  one  is  willing  to 
become  a lender. 

Ver.  38. — Give,  and  it  shall  be  green  unto  you . Many  are  lavish 
of  their  promises,  few  are  liberal  in  their  gifts.  Hence  Antigonus, 
as  Plutarch  tells  us,  was  commonly  called  Doson,  because  he  was 
always  ready  to  say  I will  give,  but  never  performed  his 

promise  of  giving.  Therefore,  Christ  bids  us  “give,”  i.e,  give  at 
once  and  without  delay,  and  it  shall  be  given  you. 

For  God  puts  it  in  the  hearts  of  men  amply  to  repay  a liberal 
giver.  It  is  said  that  a certain  monastery  became  rich  because  of 
the  large  amounts  expended  in  charity,  but  that,  when  these  were 
withheld,  it  was  reduced  to  poverty.  When  the  steward  was  com- 
plaining of  this  to  one  whom  he  was  entertaining,  the  guest  said 
Date  and  dabitur  are  sisters  : you  cast  out  the  former,  and  soon  her 
sister  and  inseparable  companion  followed.  If  you  wish  the  latter 
to  return,  recall  the  former,  and  give  as  largely  as  you  were 
accustomed  to  do.  See  verse  27,  S.  Matt.  v.  42,  and  elsewhere.  For 
almsgiving  enriches  and  does  not  impoverish.  Hence  S.  Chrysostom 
says  it  is  the  most  profitable  of  all  acts.  And  Christ  has  declared 
that  the  merciful  are  blessed,  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy.  See 
S.  Matt.  v.  7.

CHAPTER  VII. 

c Christ  findeth  a greater  faith  in  the  centurion , a Gentile , than  in  any  of  the 
Jews . 10  Healeth  his  servant  being  absent.  1 1 Raiseth  from  death  the  widow* s 
son  at  Nain . 19  Answereth  John's  messengers  with  the  declaration  of  his 

miracles.  24  Testijieth  to  the  people  what  opinion  he  held  of  John,  30  In- 
veigheth  against  the  Jews , who  with  neither  the  manners  of  John  nor  of  Jesus 
could  be  won . 36  And  sheweth,  by  occasion  of  Mary  Magdalene  y how  he  is  a 

friend  to  sinners , not  to  maintain  them  in  sins , but  to  forgive  them  their  sins , 
upon  their  faith  and  repentance. 

NOW  when  he  had  ended  all  his  sayings  in  the  audience  of  the  people,  he 
entered  into  Capernaum. 

2 And  a certain  centurion’s  servant,  who  was  dear  unto  him,  was  sick,  and 
ready  to  die. 

3 And  when  he  heard  of  Jesus,  he  sent  unto  him  the  elders  of  the  Jews,  be- 
seeching him  that  he  would  come  and  heal  his  servant 
4 And  when  they  came  to  Jesus,  they  besought  him  instantly,  saying,  That  he 
was  worthy  for  whom  he  should  do  this  : 

5  For  he  loveth  our  nation,  and  he  hath  built  us  a synagogue. 

6  Then  Jesus  went  with  them.  And  when  he  was  now  not  far  from  the  house, 
the  centurion  sent  friends  to  him,  saying  unto  him,  Lord,  trouble  not  thyself : for 
I am  not  worthy  that  thou  shouldest  enter  under  my  roof : 

7  Wherefore  neither  thought  I myself  worthy  to  come  unto  thee : but  say  in  a 
word,  and  my  servant  shall  be  healed. 

.8  For  I also  am  a man  set  under  authority,  having  under  me  soldiers,  and  I 
say  unto  one,  Go,  and  he  goeth  ; and  to  another,  Come,  and  he  cometh ; and  to 
my  servant,  Do  this,  and  he  doeth  it. 

9  When  Jesus  heard  these  things,  he  marvelled  at  him,  and  turned  him  about, 
and  said  unto  the  people  that  followed  him,  1 say  unto  you,  1 have  not  found  so 
great  faith,  no,  not  in  Israel. 

10  And  they  that  were  sent,  returning  to  the  house,  found  the  servant  whole 
that  had  been  sick. 

1 1  And  it  came  to  pass  the  day  after,  that  he  went  into  a city  called  Nain ; and 
many  of  his  disciples  went  with  him,  and  much  people. 

12  Now  when  he  came  nigh  to  the  gate  of  the  city,  behold,  there  was  a dead 
man  carried  out,  the  only  son  of  his  mother,  and  she  was  a widow  : and  much 
people  of  the  city  was  with  her. 

13  And  when  the  Lord  saw  her,  he  had  compassion  on  her,  and  said  unto  her, 
Weep  not.

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  ST.  LUKE.  1 89 

14  And  he  came  and  touched  the  bier : and  they  that  bare  him  stood  still. 
And  he  said,  Young  man,  I say  unto  thee.  Arise. 

15  And  he  that  was  dead  sat  up,  and  began  to  speak.  And  he  delivered  him 
to  his  mother. 

16  And  there  came  a fear  on  all  1 and  they  glorified  God,  saying,  That  a great 
prophet  is  risen  up  among  us ; and,  That  God  hath  visited  his  people. 

17  And  this  rumour  of  him  went  forth  throughout  all  Judaea,  and  throughout  all 
the  region  round  about. 

18  And  the  disciples  of  John  shewed  him  of  all  these  things. 

19  And  John  calling  unto  him  two  of  his  disciples  sent  thtm  to  Jesus,  saying, 
Art  thou  he  that  should  come?  or  look  we  for  another  ? 

20  When  the  men  were  come  unto  him,  they  said,  John  Baptist  hath  sent  us 
unto  thee,  saying,  Art  thou  he  that  should  come  ? or  look  we  for  another  ? 

21  And  in  that  same  hour  he  cured  many  of  their  infirmities  and  plagues,  and 
of  evil  spirits ; and  unto  many  that  were  blind  he  gave  sight. 

22  Then  Jesus  answering  said  unto  them,  Go  your  way,  and  tell  John  what 
things  ye  have  seen  and  heard ; how  that  the  blind  see,  the  lame  walk,  the  lepers 
are  cleansed,  the  deaf  hear,  the  dead  are  raised,  to  the  poor  the  gospel  is 
preached. 

23  And  blessed  is  he , whosoever  shall  not  be  offended  in  me. 

24  And  when  the  messengers  of  John  were  departed,  he  began  to  speak  unto 
the  people  concerning  John,  What  went  ye  out  into  the  wilderness  for  to  see  ? 
A reed  shaken  with  the  wind  ? 

25  But  what  went  ye  out  for  to  see  ? A man  clothed  in  soft  raiment  ? Behold, 
they  which  are  gorgeously  apparelled,  and  live  delicately,  are  in  kings*  courts. 

26  But  what  went  ye  out  for  to  see?  A prophet?  Yea,  I say  unto  you,  and 
much  more  than  a prophet. 

27  This  is  he , of  whom  it  is  written,  Behold,  I send  my  messenger  before  thy 
face,  which  shall  prepare  thy  way  before  thee. 

28  For  I say  unto  you,  Among  those  that  are  born  of  women  there  is  not  a 
greater  prophet  than  John  the  Baptist : but  he  that  is  least  in  the  kingdom  of 
God  is  greater  than  he. 

29  And  all  the  people  that  heard  him,  and  the  publicans,  justified  God,  being 
baptized  with  the  baptism  of  John. 

30  But  the  Pharisees  and  lawyers  rejected  the  counsel  of  God  against  them- 
selves,  being  not  baptized  of  him. 

31  And  the  Lord  said,  Whereunto  then  shall  I liken  the  men  of  this  genera- 
tion ? and  to  what  are  they  like? 

32  They  are  like  unto  children  sitting  in  the  marketplace,  and  calling  one 
to  another,  and  saying,  We  have  piped  unto  you,  and  ye  have  not  danced : we 
have  mourned  to  you,  and  ye  have  not  wept 

33  For  John  the  Baptist  came  neither  eating  bread  nor  drinking  wine ; and 
ye  say,  He  hath  a devil 

34  The  Son  of  man  is  come  eating  and  drinking ; and  ye  say,  Behold  a glut- 
tonous man,  and  a winebibber,  a friend  of  publicans  and  sinners  1 

35  But  wisdom  is  justified  of  all  her  children. 

36  And  one  of  the  Pharisees  desired  him  that  he  would  eat  with  him.  And 
he  went  into  the  Pharisee’s  house,  and  sat  down  to  meat

S.  LUKE,  C.  VII. 


37  And,  behold,  a woman  in  the  city,  which  was  a sinner,  when  she  knew 
that  fesus  sat  at  meat  in  the  Pharisee’s  house,  brought  an  alabaster  box  of 
ointment, 

38  And  stood  at  his  feet  behind  him  weeping,  and  began  to  wash  his  feet  with 
tears,  and  did  wipe  them  with  the  hairs  of  her  head,  and  kissed  his  feet,  and 
anointed  them  with  the  ointment. 

39  Now  when  the  Pharisee  which  had  bidden  him  saw  it \ he  spake  within  him- 
self, saying,  This  man,  if  he  were  a prophet,  would  have  known  who  and  what 
manner  of  woman  this  is  that  toucheth  him  : for  she  is  a sinner. 

40  And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  him,  Simon,  I have  somewhat  to  say  unto 
thee.  And  he  saith,  Master,  say  on. 

41  There  was  a certain  creditor  which  had  two  debtors  : the  one  owed  five 
hundred  pence,  and  the  other  fifty, 

42  And  when  they  had  nothing  to  pay,  he  frankly  forgave  them  both.  Tell  me 
therefore,  which  of  them  will  love  him  most  ? 

43  Simon  answered  and  said,  I suppose  that  he  to  whom  he  forgave  most. 
And  lie  said  unto  him,  Thou  hast  rightly  judged. 

44  And  he  turned  to  the  woman,  and  said  unto  Simon,  Seest  thou  this  woman  ? 
I entered  into  thine  house,  thou  gavest  me  no  water  for  my  feet : but  she  hath 
washed  my  feet  with  tears,  and  wiped  them  with  the  hairs  of  her  head. 

45  Thou  gavest  me  no  kiss  : but  this  woman  since  the  time  I came  in  hath  not 
ceased  to  kiss  my  feet. 

46  My  head  with  oil  thou  didst  not  anoint  : but  this  woman  hath  anointed  my 
feet  with  ointment 

47  Wherefore  I say  unto  thee,  Her  sins,  which  are  many,  are  forgiven  ; for  she 
loved  much  : but  to  whom  little  is  forgiven,  the  same  loveth  little. 

48  And  he  said  unto  her,  Thy  sins  are  forgiven. 

49  And  they  that  sat  at  meat  with  him  began  to  say  within  themselves,  Who  is 
this  that  forgiveth  sins  also  ? 

50  And  he  said  to  the  woman,  Thy  faith  hath  saved  thee ; go  in  peace. 

Ver.  1. — Now  when  he  had  ended  (or  fulfilled),  all  his  sayings. 

Ver.  2. — Ready  to  die , nigh  unto  death.  Syriac 

Ver.  3. — He  sent  to  him  the  elders  of  the  Jews , beseeching  him  that 
he  would  come  and  heal  his  servant  S.  Luke  ascribes  the  request  of 
the  Jews  to  the  Centurion  himself,  because  they  asked  in  his  name; 
but  the  Centurion  sought  not  that  Christ  should  come  unto  him,  but 
only  that  the  Lord  should  be  told,  “ My  servant  lieth  at  home  sick 
of  the  palsy,  grievously  tormented.”  S.  Matt  viii.  The  Jews  asked 
therefore  that  which  they  knew  the  Centurion  desired,  although  he 
was  too  humble-minded  to  seek  it 

“ That  he  would  come,”  *>.,  would  give  up  everything  else,  and 
apply  himself  to  the  healing  of  the  servant  An  expression  equiva- 
lent to  the  Hebrew  word  NJ,  ba,  come.

THE  CENTURION’S  SERVANT  HEALED.  19! 

Thus  God  came  to  Abimelech,  Gen.  xx ; to  Balaam,  Num.  xxii. ; 
and  to  the  Hebrews,  Deut.  xxxiii.,  when  He  appeared  to  them  and 
gave  them  the  Law.  So  it  is  said  of  the  Baptist.  John  came, 
shewed  himself,  neither  eating  nor  drinking.  The  force  of  the 
passage  lies  therefore  in  the  word  “ heal,”  that  he  would  heal  his 
servant,  whether  he  came — went  down — to  his  house  or  not. 

Ver.  6. — Lord , trouble  not  thyself  do  not  incur. the  fatigue  (Syriac) 
of  such  a journey,  but  speak  the  word  only,  and  heal  my  servant 

Ver.  11. — And  it  came  to  pass  the  day  after  that  He  went  into  a city 
called  Nain . A city  of  Galilee  two  miles  distant  from  Mount 
Tabor,  situated  on  the  river  Kison,  and  called  Nain,  from  the 
Hebrew  word  which  denotes  beauty.  Thus  Naomi  says,  “Call  me 
not  Naomi,”  i.e.  fair  or  beautiful,  “call  me  Mara ; for  the  Almighty 
hath  dealt  very  bitterly  with  me”  (Ruth  L 20) — words  which  the 
widow  of  Nain,  mourning  the  loss  of  her  only  son,  might  well 
make  her  own.  So  also  Ps.  cxxxiii.,  “ Behold  how  good  and  how 
pleasant  (Nain)  it  is  for  brethren  to  dwell  together  in  unity,”  and 
therefore  how  sad  and  sorrowful  for  brother  to  be  separated  from 
orother,  mother  from  son,  by  the  hand  of  death. 

The  place  is  specially  mentioned  for  the  confirmation  of  the 
miracle,  and  also  because  “Jesus  went  about  all  the  cities  and 
villages,  preaching  the  gospel  of  the  kingdom,  and  healing  every 
sickness  and  every  disease  among  the  people  ” (S.  Matt.  ix.  35)  ; and 
to  show  the  bitterness  of  the  mother's  grief,  for  the  death  of  her  son  at 
Nain  was  a greater  trial  to  the  mother  than  if  they  had  been  living 
in  some  country  place.  Just  as  it  seems  more  hard  for  a man  to 
be  cut  off  in  youth  than  in  age,  in  health  than  in  sickness,  in  pros- 
perity than  in  adversity,  in  the  springtide  rather  than  in  the  winter 
of  life,  as  it  is  written  (Ecclus.  xli.  1),  “O  Death,  how  bitter  is  the 
remembrance  of  thee  to  a man  that  liveth  at  rest  in  his  pos- 
sessions, unto  the  man  that  hath  nothing  to  vex  him,  and  that  hath 
prosperity  in  all  things.  O Death,  acceptable  is  thy  sentence  unto 
the  needy  and  unto  him  whose  strength  faileth,  to  whom  everything 
is  a care.”

S.  LUKE,  C.  VII. 


there  was  a dead  man  carried  out \ &c.  “ Behold,”  i.e.  by  accident, 

humanly  speaking,  Christ  met  the  bier ; but  the  meeting  was  fore- 
seen and  fore-ordained  of  Christ,  that  He  might  raise  the  dead  to  life 
He  willed,  however,  that  it  should  seem  accidental  and  not  designed, 
in  order  that  it  might  be  the  more  esteemed  ; for  as  the  proverb 
runs,  “ that  is  of  little  value  which  is  voluntarily  offered  for  sale.” 

" There  was  a dead  man  carried ” without  the  city.  Because,  for 
sanitary  and  other  reasons,  the  Jews  had  their  burial  places  without 
the  walls. 

So  the  sepulchre  of  Joseph  of  Arimathaea,  in  which  the  body  of 
Christ  lay,  was  without  Jerusalem.  So  also  the  valley  of  Jehoshaphat, 
the  scene  of  the  judgment  to  come  and  the  general  resurrection,  is 
the  common  burial-place  of  the  inhabitants  of  Jerusalem,  with  the 
exception  of  the  kings,  for  whom  David  had  provided  a sepulchre  in 
Zion,  i Kings  ii.  io.  For  similar  reasons  the  Romans,  who  were 
forbidden  by  the  twelve  tables  to  bury  their  dead  within  the  city, 
used  the  Campus  Martius  as  a place  of  sepulture,  until  Theodoric 
revoked  the  law ; and  there  is  abundant  evidence  to  show  that  the 
Christians  also,  in  the  time  of  the  persecution,  used  the  crypts  which 
they  had  excavated  without  the  city  for  purposes  of  interment,  but 
afterward,  when  peace  was  given  to  the  Christians,  they  consecrated 
burial  places  within  the  walls  near  the  temples  in  which  they  were 
wont  to  worship  : 

1.  That  the  remembrance  of  death  might  be  continually  presented 
to  the  faithful  as  an  incentive  to  a holy  life.  Like  as  the  Spartans 
were  commanded  by  Lycurgus  to  bury  their  dead  within  the  city,  in 
order  to  teach  their  young  men  that  death  was  to  be  honoured  and 
not  to  be  feared. 

2.  That  by  their  consecration  they  might  be  secure  against  the 
wiles  of  the  devils,  who  are  wont  to  dwell  in  the  tombs  and  possess 
the  bodies  of  those  departed.  S.  Luke  viii.  27. 

3.  And  also  that  the  faithful  when  on  their  way  to  worship  might 
be  led  to  pray  that  those  who  lay  buried  around  might  be  released 
from  purgatory,  and  counted  worthy  of  a glorious  resurrection  at  the 
last  day,  and  also  that  they  might  be  partakers  in  the  holy  sacrifices

offered  in  the  temples  and  might  benefit  by  the  merits  and  by  the 
prayers  of  those  Saints  who  either  lie  buried,  or  are  in  some  way 
especially  commemorated  therein.  Thus  Constantine  the  Great 
wished  to  be  buried  in  the  porch  of  the  Church  of  the  Holy  Apostles 
at  Constantinople,  and  Theodosius  in  the  Church  of  S.  Peter  at 
Rome.  Ancfso,  as  most  of  the  churches  at  Rome  show,  the  Christians 
built  altars  over  the  tombs  of  the  martyrs,  for  reasons  which  I have 
given  in  my  comments  on  the  text,  “ I saw  under  the  altar  the  souls 
of  them  that  were  slain.”  Rev.  vi  9. 

The  only  son , ptityfnfc,  *.*.  the  only  child  of  his  mother,  and 
therefore  the  sole  object  of  her  love.  For  he  was  to  her  her  hope 
and  her  future,  the  support  of  her  declining  years,  and  the  light  of 
her  eyes.  Hence  the  mother’s  grief  was  of  the  bitterest  kind,  like 
to  that  which  the  prophets  tell  of : “ They  shall  mourn  for  him  as 
one  moumeth  for  his  only  son,”  Zech.  xiL  10.  And  again,  “O 
daughter  of  my  people,  gird  thee  with  sackcloth  and  wallow  thyself 
in  ashes:  make  thee  mourning  as  for  an  only  son,  most  bitter 
lamentation.”  Jer.  vi.  26. 

And  much  people  of  the  city  was  with  her  This  widow  seems  to 
have  been  a woman  highly  esteemed  by  her  fellow-citizens,  “out 
of  respect  for  whom  they  joined  in  the  funeral  procession.”  S. 
Ambrose.  Furthermore,  there  is  generally  at  the  gate  of  a city 
a great  crowd  of  people  going  in  and  coming  out,  particularly  as 
formerly  the  gate  was  not  only  the  market-place,  but  also  the 
seat  of  judgment 

Hence  God  willed  that  the  miracle  should  be  thus  publicly 
wrought,  that  many  being  witnesses  of  it,  many  might  be  led  to  give 
praise  to  Him.  Bede. 

Ver.  13. — And  when  the  Lord  saw  her,  Lie  had  compassion  on  her 
and  said  unto  her,  Weep  not  Nay,  rather  begin  to  rejoice,  for  I 
will  restore  your  son  to  life  again,  mourn  not  as  dead  one 
whom  thou  shalt  soon  see  brought  back  again  to  life.  Bede.  He 
forbids  her  to  weep  for  him,  who  was  about  to  rise  from  the  dead, 
S.  Ambrose.

Young  man , I say  unto  thee , Arise.  The  bier, , an  open  bier  surely, 
as  is  common  amongst  the  Jews. 

Arise.  Elijah,  Elisha,  and  others  restored  the  dead  to  life  by  means 
of  prayer  to  God,  but  Christ  at  a word,  as  Lord  of  life  and  death,  and 
therefore  very  God.  He  touched  the  bier,  says  Cyril^to  show  that 
his  body  was  effectual  for  the  salvation  of  men,  for  as  iron  heated 
in  the  fire  does  the  work  of  fire,  and  kindles  the  chaff,  so  the  flesh 
united  to  the  Word  gives  life  to  mankind. 

Ver.  15. — And  he  that  was  dead  sat  up  and  began  to  speak.  Sat 
up , raised  himself  up  into  a sitting  posture,  and  so  returned  to 
life ; for  to  sit  up  and  to  begin  to  speak  are  sure  signs  of  returning 
animation. 

And  He  delivered  him  to  his  mother , Le.  He  took  him  by  the 
hand  and  placed  him  on  his  feet,  then  led  him  to  his  mother. 
Behold  thy  son  ! Take  him  home  with  thee,  that  thou  mayest  rejoice 
over  him,  and  that  he  may  render  thee  true  filial  obedience. 

Ver.  16. — And  there  came  a fear  on  all \ 

Ver.  17. — And  this  rumour  of  Him  went  forth  throughout  ail 
fudeea , and  throughout  all  the  region  round  about.  Fear,  ue. 
reverence,  and  a sacred  awe,  mixed  with  admiration  and  joy. 

A great  prophet.  The  Messiah,  of  whose  coming  all  were  in 
anxious  expectation. 

Allegorically.  The  widow  is  the  Church  who  mourns  her  sons — 
those  who  have  fallen  into  mortal  sin  and  forfeited  the  grace  of 
God — as  dead,  and  seeks  by  her  tears  for  their  restoration ; and  in 
answer  to  her  prayers,  Christ — 1.  Causes  the  bearers  to  stand  still, 
checks  those  evil  passions  which  gain  the  mastery  over  the  young, 
and  breaks  their  power.  2.  Touches  the  bier,  i.e.  the  wood  of  the 
Cross,  and  by  it  raises  the  dead  to  life.  For  by  virtue  of  Christ 
sinners  are  moved  to  repentance,  and  restored  to  favour  with 
God.  Hence,  3.  The  dead  man  sits  up  and  begins  to  speak, 
begins  to  lead  a new  life  and  give  praise  unto  God,  so  that  those 
who  are  witnesses  of  this  marvellous  change  are  filled  with 
admiration  and  are  led  to  give  glory  unto  God.  So  S.  Ambrose 
and  others.

A priest’s  duties  to  the  erring. 


195 


Of  this  we  have  a living  example  in  S.  Monica,  for  she  mourned 
unceasingly  for  her  son,  who  was  dead  in  trespasses  and  sins,  but 
recalled  by  her  prayers  to  such  holiness  of  life  that  he  afterwards 
became  a chief  doctor  of  the  Church.  S.  Augustine,  Confessions . 

flpin,  mnrr  particularly,  the  widow  is  the  Church,  the  son  the 
people  of  the  Gentiles  enclosed  in  the  bier  of  concupiscence,  and 
borne  along  to  hell  as  to  a sepulchre.  By  touch  of  the  bier,  ie. 
by  the  wood  of  the  Cross,  Christ  gave  life  to  the  world. 

Figuratively . By  the  example  of  the  widow  we  see  how  a priest 
or  director  should  act  when  any  of  his  spiritual  children  have  fallen 
into  mortal  sin  and  are  being  borne  to  the  grave  of  everlasting 
misery.  He  should  follow  the  bier  with  weeping  and  much  lamenta- 
tion, for  thus  he  will  receive  comfort  from  the  Lord  who— (1.)  Touch- 
ing the  bier  will  cause  the  bearers  to  stand  still,  ie.  cause  evil  lusts 
and  passions  to  cease ; (2.)  will  recall  the  dead  to  life  ; and  (3.)  will 
raise  him  up  to  the  performance  of  good  works,  so  as  to  confess 
his  sins  and  tell  of  the  loving-kindness  of  God. 

Thus  at  last  he  is  restored  to  the  Church,  his  mother,  whose  past 
sorrow  will  be  eclipsed  by  her  present  joy,  and  thus  also  many  will 
be  led  to  extol  the  goodness  of  God. 

Again,  the  widow  represents  the  soul,  her  son  the  understanding, 
inactive  and  dead.  When  such  a soul  laments  her  spiritual  death, 
especially  if  others  also  join  in  her  mourning,  Christ  will  grant  an 
awakening.  The  bier  is  a conscience  in  a state  of  false  security. 
The  bearers,  the  evil  enticements  and  flatteries  of  companions  which 
stand  still,  ie.  are  restrained  at  the  touch  of  Christ  Bede.  Or,  as 
Theophylact  interprets  it,  the  widow  is  the  soul  which  has  lost  its 
husband,  ie.  the  word  of  life ; the  son  is  the  understanding ; the 
body,  the  coffin  or  bier. 

To  sum  up.  We  read  that  Christ  on  three  occasions  recalled  the 
dead  to  life. 

x.  The  daughter  of  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  in  the  house,  ie. 
one  who  sins  in  thought  and  intention. 

a.  The  son  of  the  widow  at  the  gate,  ie.  one  who  sins  openly, 
and  imparts  his  guilt  tQ  others,

3.  Lazarus  in  the  tomb,  the  habitual  sinner  who  lies  as  it  were 
buried  in  sin  without  hope  of  recovery  or  release. 

The  first,  Christ  raised  to  life  by  secret  prayer  apart  from  others ; 
the  second  by  a word;  the  third  by  crying  with  a loud  voice, 
Lazarus,  come  forth.  Hence  different  degrees  of  «ia  hjtve  different 
remedies,  but  to  rescue  the  habitual  sinner  from  the  death  of  sin 
there  needs  no  less  than  the  voice  of  Christ  speaking  loudly  to  the 
sinner’s  heart. 

Ver.  29. — And  the  publicans  justified  God . Confessed  the  good- 
ness of  God  in  sending  the  Baptist,  and  in  offering  them  salvation 
through  his  baptism  and  preaching.  See  verse  35 ; 1 Tim.  iii.  16; 
and  S.  Matt  xi.  19. 

There  is  a question  whether  this  verse  and  the  one  following 
give  the  words  of  the  Evangelist  or  of  our  Lord  Himself.  But  as 
the  opening  words  of  the  31st  verse,  “and  the  Lord  said,”  are  absent 
from  the  best  MSS.,  we  may  conclude,  with  Maldonatus,  that  these 
two  verses  are  a part  of  the  continuous  discourse  of  Christ. 

Ver.  30. — But  the  Pharisees  and  lawyers  rejected  the  counsel  of  God 
against  themselves , either  within  themselves,  t\e.  in  their  hearts, 
because  they  did  not  dare  openly  contravene  His  words,  or  as 
against  themselves,  i.e,  for  their  own  condemnation.  Bede. 

Ver.  36. — And  one  of  the  Pharisees  desired  that  He  would  eat  with 
him , and  He  went  into  the  Pharisees  house  and  sat  down  to  meat . 

Ver.  37. — And  behold  a woman  in  the  city . Behold,  a wonderful 
thing,  and  a wonderful  example  of  penitence.  A woman  called 
Mary  Magdalene.  S.  Luke  viiL  2.  It  is  questioned  whether  this 
is  the  same  woman  who  is  mentioned  by  the  two  other  Evangelista 
S.  Chrysostom  thinks  there  were  two;  Origen,  Theophylact,  and 
Euthymius,  three  who  thus  anointed  our  Lord,  and  that  each 
Evangelist  wrote  of  a different  person.  S.  Matt.  xxvi.  7 ; S. 
John  xii.  3. 

But  I hold  that  it  was  one  and  the  same  woman — Mary 
Magdalene,  the  sister  of  Martha  and  of  Lattarus,  who  anointed  our 
Lord,  as  we  read  in  the  Gospels,  on  two  but  npt  three  occasions ; 
and  this  is  clear, — -

WHO  MARY  MAGDALENE  WAS.

1.  Because  this  is  the  general  interpretation  of  the  Church,  who  in 
her  Offices  accepts  what  is  here  written  by  S.  Luke  as  referring  to 
the  Magdalene  alone. 

2.  Because  S.  John  (id.  2)  writes,  “It  was  that  Mary  which 
anointed  the  Lord  with  ointment,  and  wiped  his  feet  with  her  hair, 
whose  brother  Lazarus  was  sick,”  thus  plainly  alluding  to  this 
passage  of  S.  Luke,  and  signifying  that  only  one  woman  anointed 
the  Lord.  For  if  there  had  been  more  than  one,  the  words  just 
quoted  would  have  insufficiently  described  her.  But  the  meaning  is, 
“ when  I say  Mary,  I mean  the  penitent  who  anointed  the  feet  of 
the  Lord,  as  recounted  by  S.  Luke,  whom  all  know  to  be  Mary 
Magdalene.” 

3.  Because  the  Mary  mentioned  by  S.  John  (xii.  2,  3)  is  clearly 
the  same  Mary  Magdalene,  the  sister  of  Martha  and  of  Lazarus,  who 
anointed  Christ  here,  as  described  by  S.  Luke,  and  again  at 
Bethany,  six  days  before  the  passover.  For  S.  Matthew  (xxvl  6)  and 
S.  John  (xii.  1)  both  refer  to  the  same  event,  as  is  evident  if  the  two 
accounts  are  compared  together.  Therefore  it  was  Mary  Magdalene 
who  anointed  Christ,  not  three  times,  as  Origen  would  have  us 
believe,  but  twice  only,  once  as  is  recorded  by  S.  Luke,  and  again 
six  days  before  His  death. 

4.  The  same  thing  is  testified  to  by  Church  history  and  tradition, 
and  also  by  the  inscription  on  the  tomb  of  the  Magdalene,  which 
Maximus,  one  of  the  seventy  disciples,  is  said  to  have  built 

5.  And  this  is  also  the  opinion  of  S.  Augustine,  S.  Cyprian,  and 
many  other  interpreters  of  scripture. 

But  it  may  be  objected  that  this  Magdalene  followed  Jesus  from 
Galilee  (S.  Matt  xxvii.  55),  and  was  a Galilean,  and  cannot  have 
been  the  same  as  Mary  the  sister  of  Martha,  who  lived  at  Bethany, 
and  was  therefore  of  Judaea.  I answer  that  she  was  of  Judaea  by 
descent,  but  seems  to  have  lived  in  Galilee,  it  may  be  in  the  castle 
called  Magdala,  either  because  she  had  married  the  lord  of  that 
place,  or  because  it  had  been  allotted  her  as  her  share  of  the  family 
property.  Hence  she  was  called  Magdalene  from  the  name  of  the 
place,  Magdala.  So  Jansenius  and  others.

In  the  city \ Some  think  in  Jerusalem.  But  Jerusalem  was  in 
Judaea,  and  these  things  seem  to  have  been  done  in  Galilee  where 
Christ  was  preaching.  Hence  it  is  very  probable  that  the  city  was 
Nain,  the  scene  of  Christ’s  miracle,  as  Toletus  and  others  conjecture ; 
but  some  think  that  it  was  the  town  of  Magdala  in  which  she  lived, 
an  idea  which  Adricomius  on  the  word  Magdalum  supports. 

A sinner . Some  recent  writers,  to  honour  the  Magdalene,  think  that 
she  was  not  unchaste,  but  only  conceited  and  vain,  and  for  this  reason 
called  a sinner.  But  in  proportion  as  they  thus  honour  the  Magda- 
lene, they  detract  from  the  grace  of  God  and  that  penitence  which 
enabled  her  to  live  a holy  life.  For  by  the  word  sinner  we  gene- 
rally understand  one  who  not  only  sins,  but  leads  others  also  to  sin. 
The  word  sinner  therefore  here  signifies  a harlot,  i.e.  one  who  has 
many  lovers  although  she  may  not  make  a public  market  of  her 
charms,  and  this  interpretation  is  accepted  by  S.  Augustine,  S. 
Jerome,  Isidore  of  Pelusium,  S.  Ambrose,  Gregory,  Bede,  and 
S.  Chrysostom,  who  holds  (Horn.  62  ad  Pop.)  that  to  her  refer  the 
words  of  our  Lord,  “Verily,  I say  unto  you,  that  the  publicans  and 
harlots  go  into  the  kingdom  of  God  before  you.”  S.  Matt  xxii.  31. 
Hence  the  Church  hymn  : — 

So  she,  who  hath  so  many  sins  committed, 

Now  from  the  very  jaws  of  hell  returns  ; 

E’en  to  the  threshold  of  a Life  eternal, 

After  her  fitful  life  of  guilt  and  shame. 

She,  from  a seething  caldron  of  offences, 

A fair  and  perfumed  vase  is  now  become  ; 

From  an  uncomely  vessel  of  dishonour 
Translated  to  a vessel  full  of  grace. 

Doubtlessly  Christ  permitted  her  to  be  entangled  in  all  the 
filth  of  a wanton  life,  that  He  might  show  the  power  of  His  grace 
in  winning  her  back  to  purity  again,  for  the  worse  the  disease 
the  greater  the  skill  of  the  physician  in  curing  it  Nor  does  this 
detract  from  the  honour  due  to  the  Magdalene,  for  the  greater 
her  sins,  the  more  admirable  her  penitence,  and  the  stronger  her 
resolution  to  forsake  them. 

God  willed  that  she  should  be  an  example  of  penitence,  that

none  should  despair  of  pardon  because  ot  the  heinousness  of  their 
offences,  but  trust  to  the  infinite  compassion  of  God,  mindful  of 
the  saying  of  S.  Paul,  “ This  is  a faithful  saying,  and  worthy  of  all 
acceptation,  that  Christ  Jesus  came  into  the  world  to  save  sinners; 
of  whom  I am  chief  Howbeit  for  this  cause  I obtained  mercy, 
that  in  me  first  Jesus  Christ  might  show  forth  all  longsuffering,  for 
a pattern  to  them  which  should  hereafter  believe  on  Him  to  life 
everlasting.”  1 Tim.  i 15,  16. 

“Truly,”  says  S.  Gregory,  “a  life  anxious  to  atone  for  faults  com- 
mitted is  oftentimes  more  pleasing  to  God  than  that  innocence 
which  rests  in  a torpid  security.” 

Great,  indeed,  is  the  gift  of  innocence  by  which  we  are  preserved 
from  sin,  but  greater  is  the  grace  of  penitence  and  remission  of  sin, 
and  this  grace  is  the  greater  in  proportion  to  the  greatness  of  the 
sin,  for  thus  forgiveness  is  granted  to  the  more  unworthy,  and  so  the 
grace  becomes  to  him  the  greater,  as  S.  Thomas  teaches.  Hence 
sinners  who  truly  repent  excel  their  brethren  in  humility,  and  in 
austerity  and  holiness  of  life,  and  often  perform  acts  of  heroism 
which  those  who  have  sinned  less  deeply  are  unable  to  da  As  may 
be  seen  in  the  case  of  many  saints,  and  especially  in  that  of  one 
who  from  a robber  became  the  very  mirror  of  monks.  For  the 
baseness  of  his  former  life,  the  baseness  of  his  sin,  the  punishment 
due  to  his  offences,  and  the  pardoning  love  of  God,  are  to  the 
penitent  so  many  incentives  to  a better  and  a holier  life. 

So  the  pearl  is  the  emblem  of  penitence.  For  as  the  sun  by  its 
rays  was  said  to  convert  the  substance  of  the  oyster  into  a precious 
jewel,  so  Christ  by  his  transforming  grace  changed  the  woman  that 
was  a sinner  into  a pearl — a penitent  saint 

When  she  knew  that  Jesus  sat  at  meat  in  the  Pharisees  house . 
It  was  not  fitting  that  the  Magdalene,  whose  sinful  life  was  known 
to  all,  should  anoint  Christ  in  her  own  house,  but  rather  in  the 
house  of  another,  so  that  there  might  be  no  suspicion  of  eviL  Hence 
she  was  not  ashamed  to  act  as  she  did  in  the  house  of  the  Pharisee ; 
for,  as  S.  Gregory  says  (Horn,  33),  Being  filled  with  shame  within, 
she  did  not  think  there  was  any  cause  for  the  show  of  shame  without

And  S.  Augustine  (Horn.  58  de  Temp)  writes,  The  sinner  who  washed 
the  feet  of  the  Lord  with  her  tears,  and  dried  them  with  the  hairs 
of  her  head,  when  she  knew  that  the  heavenly  physician  had  come, 
entered  the  house  an  uninvited  guest ; and  thus  she,  who  had  been 
shameless  in  sin,  became  yet  more  bold  in  seeking  salvation, 
and  so  deserved  to  hear  that  her  sins  were  forgiven.  And  again 
(Horn.  33),  Thou  hast  seen  how  a woman  of  notoriously  evil  repute 
entered,  uninvited,  the  house  where  her  Physician  sat  at  meat,  and 
although  little  fitted  for  a feast,  was  fitted  for  the  blessing  which 
she  thus  boldly  (pi&  impudentii)  sought  to  obtain.  For  she  knew 
how  great  was  her  need,  and  that  He  to  whom  she  had  come,  could 
grant  her  relief.  For  Christ  accepted  the  invitation  of-the  Pharisee, 
in  order  to  provide  those  who  sat  at  meat  with  the  spiritual  feast  of 
the  repentant  Magdalene.  Hence  S.  Chrysostom  (Serm.  93) : Christ 
sat  at  the  feast,  not  to  drink  cups  of  wine  flavoured  with  honey  and 
perfumed  with  flowers,  but  the  bitter  tears  of  repentance ; because 
God  longs  for  the  tears  of  the  sinner.  For,  as  S.  Bernard  says,  the 
tears  of  penitence  are  the  wine  of  angels,  and  yield  them  unbounded 
delight  And  again  (Serm.  30  in  Cant),  Tears  are  an  earnest  of 
repentance,  and  a return  to  the  blessing  and  favour  of  God,  and 
therefore  of  sweet  savour  to  His  angels. 

An  alabaster  box  of  ointment.  See  S.  Matt.  xxvi.  6. 

Ver.  38.  And  stood  at  His  feet  behind  Him  weeping,  and  began  to 
wash  His  feet  with  tears,  and  did  wipe  them  with  the  hairs  of  her  head, 
and  kissed  His  feet,  and  anointed  them  with  the  ointment. 

At  His  feet.  The  ancients  at  their  feasts  reclined  on  couches, 
their  heads  resting  on  their  hands,  their  feet  turned  away  from  the 
table,  so  that  there  might  be  room  for  others  on  the  same  couch. 
Hence  it  was  easy  for  the  Magdalene  to  fulfil  her  pious  purpose,  for 
tradition  represents  her  as  a woman  of  lofty  stature. 

She  stood.  Standing  indicates  not  the  posture,  but  the  presence 
of  any  one. 

She  stood,  i.e.  she  came,  and  feB  on  her  knees,  at  the  feet  of 
Christ  For  kneeling  is  the  posture  of  penitence. 

She  drew  nigh,  says  S.  Augustine  (Horn.  33),  to  the  feet  of  the

THE  MAGDALENE’S  MODESTY  AND  REVERENCE.  201 


Lord,  and  she  who  for  long  had  taken  to  evil  ways,  now  seeks  to 
direct  her  steps  aright  For  humble  contrition  she  weeps,  and 
washes  the  feet  of  Christ,  and  in  the  devotion  with  which  she  wiped 
and  anointed  them,  although  silent,  she  speaks. 

In  the  Magdalene  therefore  was  fulfilled  that  which  is  written : 
u Tell  me,  O thou  whom  my  soul  loveth,  where  thou  feedest,  where 
thou  makest  thy  flock  to  rest  at  noon;”  also,  “ While  the  King 
sitteth  at  his  table,  my  spikenard  sendeth  forth  the  smell  thereof” 
(Cant.  L 7-12);  and  further,  “I  will  rise  now  and  go  about  the  city 
in  the  streets,  and  in  the  broad  ways  I will  seek  him  whom  my  soul 
loveth  ” (Cant  iii.  a),  which  see. 

Note  here  t.  The  reverence  and  modesty  of  the  Magdalene, 
which  is  the  grace  of  youth  and  of  penitence.  She  drew  nigh  to 
Christ,  not  in  front  of  Him,  for  she  considered  that  she  was,  on 
account  of  her  past  misdeeds,  unworthy  of  His  holy  presence,  but 
at  His  feet  Therefore,  S.  Bernard  accounts  reverence  or  modesty 
(Serm.  86,  in  Cant.)  to  be  the  foundation  of  all  virtues.  “How 
great,”  he  says,  “is  the  grace  and  the  beauty  which  a modest  blush 
lends  to  the  check  1 ” 

2.  S.  Mary  Magdalene,  aar  S.  Chrysostom  {Horn,  n,  on  S.  Matt.) 
observes,  was  the  first  who  came  to  Jesus  for  pardon  and  forgiveness. 
Those  before  her  had  sought  restoration  to  bodily  health  alone. 
Therefore,  wounded  like  a deer,  she,  wounded  by  the  dart  of  Chrises 
love,  runs  to  Him  for  succour.  Christ  had  showed  her  her  wretched- 
ness ; hence,  overcome  with  sorrow  and  remorse,  she  could  not  bear 
for  one  moment  longer  the  burden  of  her  sins,  but  at  once  sought 
of  Him  pardon  and  release.  Therefore,  without  waiting  until  Christ 
had  left  the  Pharisee’s  house,  she  burst  in  uninvited  to  the  feast 
So  foul  and  loathsome  is  even  one  mortal  sin  alone.  As  S.  Anselm 
asserts  (De  Similit.  cap.  cxc.),  “If  of  necessity  I had  to  choose 
between  sin  and  the  torments  of  hell,  I had  rather  plunge  headlong 

into  hell,  than  give  sin  the  mastery  over  me ; ” and  he  adds,  “ I had 

* 

rather  enter  hell  pure  from  the  stain  of  sin,  than  reign  in  heaven  a 
prey  to  its  pollutions.” 

3.  The  act  of  S.  Mary  Magdalene  seems  as  if  prompted  by  the

words  of  the  Baptist,  “ Behold  the  Lamb  of  God,  which  taketh  away 
the  sin  of  the  world,”  S.  John  i.  29 ; or  by  the  invitation  of  Christ, 
“ Come  unto  Me,  all  ye  that  labour  and  are  heavy  laden,  and  I will 
give  you  rest,”  S.  Matt  xi.  28.  Moreover,  she  was  persuaded  that 
He,  who  had  delivered  her  from  the  possession  of  the  seven  devils 
(S.  Luke  viiL  2),  would  deliver  her  also  from  the  bondage  of  sin. 
Therefore,  in  deepest  contrition  she  draws  nigh  to  Christ,  acknow- 
ledging Him  to  be  a prophet  sent  from  God  with  power  to  forgive 
sins,  and  in  full  hope  that  He  would  pardon  the  guilt  which  she  had 
contracted ; for,  S.  Gregory  says,  Christ  drew  her  to  Himself  by 
inward  grace,  and  received  her  outwardly  with  pity  and  compassion. 

And  began  to  wash  His  feet  with  her  tears.  Observe  how  abun- 
dant were  the  tears  of  the  penitent,  inasmuch  as  they  were  able  to 
wash  and  cleanse  the  dust-stained  feet  of  the  Lord.  See  S.  Matt, 
x.  1 a On  their  power  and  efficacy,  S.  Chrysostom  has  written 
(Serm.  de  Pcenitmtia ),  and  S.  Ambrose,  “Christ  washed  not  His 
own  feet,  in  order  that  we  might  wash  them  with  our  tears. 
Blessed  tears,  not  only  because  they  are  able  to  wash  away  our 
guilt,  but  because  they  besprinkle  the  firstfruits  of  the  heavenly 
Word,  and  incline  His  steps  towards  us.” 

Blessed  tears,  for  they  not  only  obtain  pardon  for  the  sinner,  but 
strength  and  refreshment  for  the  just  For  truly  is  it  written  “ My 
tears  have  been  my  meat  day  and  night,”  Ps.  xlii.  3.  And  S. 
Gregory  (Horn.  33) : “ As  I ponder  over  the  penitence  of  the  Mag- 
dalene, I long  to  keep  silent  and  weep.  For  what  heart  so  hard,  as 
not  to  be  softened  by  the  tears  of  this  penitent  sinner,  who  con- 
sidered what  she  had  done,  and  was  careless  of  what  she  would  do— 
who  entered  unbidden  to  the  feast,  and  wept  amongst  those  who 
were  feasting.  Learn  then  how  great  must  have  been  the  com- 
punction and  sorrow  which  impelled  her  on  such  an  occasion 
to  weep.” 

And  did  wipe  them  with  the  hairs  of  her  head.  Other  means  were 
at  hand,  but  in  her  deep  penitence,  the  Magdalen  would  dedicate 
to  the  service  of  Christ  the  very  hair  which  once  she  took  such 
pride  in  adorning.  Hence  S.  Cyprian  (De  Ablutione\  She  used  her

hair  for  a napkin,  her  eyes  for  a pitcher,  and  her  tears  for  water. 
Her  contrition  showed  itself  by  her  tears ; her  faith  washed  the  feet 
of  the  Lord,  her  love  anointed  them.  She  made  her  head  to  be  a 
foot-stool,  and  wiped  the  sacred  feet  with  her  unloosened  hair. 
Without  reserve,  she  gave  herself  to  Christ,  and  He,  regarding  the 
intention  rather  than  the  act,  anointed  the  anointer,  cleansed  her 
who  was  cleansing,  and  wiped  away  her  sins. 

S.  Euthymius  assigns  the  cause,  “ He  makes  instruments  of  sin, 
instruments  of  righteousness.”  And  more  particularly  S.  Gregory 
(Ham,  33),  “ That  which  she  had  given  up  to  the  service  of  sin, 
now  she  offers  for  the  glory  of  God.  Her  eyes,  which  had  lusted 
after  earthly  things,  she  wears  away  with  the  tears  of  repentance. 
Her  hair,  which  once  added  to  the  comeliness  of  her  face,  she  now 
used  to  dry  up  her  tears.  With  her  mouth,  which  was  wont  to  speak 
proudly,  she  now  kisses  the  ground  on  which  the  feet  of  the  Lord 
trod.  All  her  sinful  indulgences  she  sacrifices  for  the  love  of  Christ, 
and  making  her  former  vices  give  place  to  virtues,  wherewith  she 
offended  therewith  she  now  serves  God.” 

Hear  also  S.  Chrysostom  (Horn.  6, on  S.  Matt.) : “So  the  woman 
which  was  a sinner,  inflamed  with  the  fires  of  love,  and  purged  by 
her  flood  of  tears  from  the  stains  and  defilement  of  sin,  exceeded 
even  the  virtue  of  virgins.  For  in  the  warmth  of  her  penitence  she 
exulted  in  her  longings  for  Christ ; washing  His  feet  with  her  tears, 
wiping  them  with  the  hairs  of  her  head,  and  anointing  them  with 
ointment  of  price.  Thus  she  acted  outwardly,  but  how  much  more 
fervent  were  the  thoughts  of  her  heart,  which  were  known  only  to 
God.” 

And  kissed  his  feet.  She  who  once  delighted  in  the  kisses  01 
unchaste  desire,  now  chastely  kisses  the  feet  of  Christ,  and 
seeks  thereby  the  pardon  and  forgiveness  of  her  sins.  For  a kiss 
is  a sign  of  forgiveness,  as  well  as  of  kindness  and  of  love.  S. 
Ambrose. 

Mystically.  The  two  feet  of  Christ,  says  S.  Peter  Damian,  are 
mercy  and  judgment  To  kiss  one  without  the  other  is  productive 
of  rash  security,  or  of  an  evil  despair.  Publicly,  at  a public  feast,

in  presence  of  all  the  guests,  the  Magdalene  performed  her  act  of 
penitence,  that  her  openly  avowed  repentance  might  atone  for  the 
public  scandal  of  her  former  life. 

And  anointed  them  with  the  ointment ■ The  ancients  made 

frequent  use  of  ointments  or  perfumes.  See  Eccles.  ix.  8.  And 
these  were  generally  prepared  by  women,  i Sam.  viiL  13. 

The  Magdalene  boldly  entered  the  house  of  Simon  her  friend 
at  the  time  of  the  feast,  that  thus  she  might  show  the  warmth  of  her 
love  for  Christ.  Titus.  For,  as  S.  Paulinus  says  (Epist.  4,  ad 
Severum),  The  Lord  regarded  not  the  ointment,  but  the  love  which 
impelled  her,  fearless  of  reproach  or  rejection,  to  enter  uninvited  the 
house  of  the  Pharisee,  and  with  that  violence  by  which  the  kingdom 
of  heaven  is  taken  by  force,  she  ran  to  the  feet  of  Christ,  and  made 
them  to  be,  if  I may  so  express  myself,  her  sanctuary  and  her  altar. 
There  she  consecrated  her  tears — made  offering  of  a sweet-smelling 
savour,  and  made  sacrifice  of  her  affections  and  passions ; a broken 
and  contrite  heart,  a sacrifice  with  which  God  is  well-pleased. 
Therefore  she  not  only  obtained  the  forgiveness  of  her  sins,  but 
wheresoever  the  Gospel  is  preached,  there  what  she  hath  done  shall 
be  told  for  a memorial  of  her. 

Mystically . S.  Peter  Damian  explains,  that  this  ointment  was 
made  out  of  our  sins ; for  she,  mixed  and  macerated  in  the  mortar 
of  repentance,  sprinkled  with  the  oil  of  discernment,  and  softened 
in  the  caldron  of  discipline  by  the  fires  of  remorse,  is  applied  a 
precious  and  acceptable  ointment  to  the  Saviour’s  feqj.  He  adds 
also  that  this  ointment  was  fourfold,  inasmuch  as  it  was  composed 
1.  of  devotion ; a.  many  virtues ; 3.  piety ; and  4.  pity. 

Note  what  a noble  example  of  penitence  and  of  virtue  the 
Magdalene  presents. 

1.  Her  remarkable  faith  in  believing  that  Christ  was  able  to 
forgive  sins,  a power  which  the  Scribes  and  Pharisees  denied  Him, 
and  which  no  other  prophet  possessed.  Hence  if  we  may  credit  S. 
Augustine  {Hon t.  33),  she  believed  that  He  who  had  power  to 
forgive  sins,  was  more  than  man,  and  was  led  by  divine  illumination 
to  acknowledge  Christ  to  be  God ; for,  as  S.  Augustine  goes  on  to

DEPTH  OF  THE  MAGDALENE’S  PENITENCE.  205 

say,  to  believe  that  Christ  can  forgive  sins,  is  to  believe  that  He  is 
God  ; and  he  adds,  “She  drew  nigh  unto  the  Lord  impure,  to  return 
pure ; sick,  to  return  sound ; a confessor  of  sin,  to  return  a disciple 
of  Christ.” 

2.  Her  wonderful  devotion  in  continuing  to  kiss  the  feet  of  Jesus, 
and  wash  them  with  her  tears  until  she  heard  Him  say,  “Thy  sins 
are  forgiven : go  in  peace.” 

3.  Her  great  wisdom  in  not  seeking  pardon  by  the  words  of  her 
mouth,  but  rather  by  the  deep  yearnings  of  her  heart. 

4.  The  depth  of  her  penitence,  in  that  for  thirty  years,  after  thus 
publicly  showing  her  contrition,  she  lived  in  the  desert  a life  given 
up  to  austerities  and  the  practice  of  good  works.  Henoe  Petrarch 
writes 

“ Love  and  hope  deep  seated  in  the  heart  made  cold  and  hunger 
sweet,  and  turned  the  hard  rock  into  a pleasant  couch ; ” and  adds, 
“Here,  unseen  by  men,  but  surrounded  by  bands  of  angels,  and 
supported  by  the  daily  Offices,  thou  wast  permitted  to  hear  the 
responsive  chantings  of  the  angelic  choirs.”  And  so  Christ  revealed 
to  S.  Bridget  that  there  were  three  saints  specially  pleasing  to  Him  : 
the  Blessed  Virgin,  John  the  Baptist,  and  Mary  Magdalene,  of 
whom  He  spake  thus : — When  Mary  Magdalene  was  converted,  the 
devils  said,  ‘ How  shall  we  gain  power  over  her  again,  for  we  have 
lost  a goodly  prey  ? We  cannot  look  at  her  because  of  her  tears ; so 
covered  and  protected  is  she  by  good  works,  that  no  spot  or  soil  of 
sin  can  stain  her  soul;  so  holy  is  her  life,  so  fervent  her  love  for 
God,  that  we  dare  not  draw  nigh  her.’  ” 

Figuratively , S.  Ambrose  (lib.  de  Tobia , cap.  xii.),  says,  “Whoso 
hath  pity  on  the  poor  anoints  the  feet  of  Christ.  For  the  poor  are 
His  feet,  and  on  them  He  harmlessly  walks.” 

Ver.  39. — Now  when  the  Pharisee  which  had  bidden  Him  saw  it , 
he  spake  within  himself  \ sayings  This  man , if  He  were  a prophet , would 
have  known  who  and  what  manner  of  woman  this  is  that  toucheth 
Him:  for  she  is  a sinner , and  therefore  unfit  to  touch  a holy 
prophet  This  Pharisee  was,  as  S.  Augustine  says  (Serm.  23),  one 
of  those  self-righteous  men,  of  whom  Isaiah  wrote,  chap.  lii.  1 1.

S.  LUKE,  C.  VII. 


But  Simon’s  reasoning  was  false,  for  the  unclean  touched  Christ 
that  they  might  be  cleansed  by  Him.  For  this  cause  He  came  into 
the  world,  that  as  the  good  physician,  He  might  heal  all  manner  of 
diseases,  whether  of  the  body  or  of  the  soul  He  was  offended,  there- 
fore, because,  as  Euthymius  says,  he  knew  not  that  Christ,  although 
very  God,  was  made  man  to  save  sinners.  And,  again,  the  Magdalene 
was  not  now  unclean,  for  she  had  been  cleansed  by  contrition,  as 
Christ  proceeded  to  show.  Simon  was  deceived,  because  he  judged 
of  the  past,  and  not  of  the  present  For  Mary  was  the  same,  yet 
another.  Another,  yet  her  very  self,  says  Chrysologus  (Serm.  74). 
Wherefore  the  humble  penitent  was  holier  than  the  proud  Pharisee, 
who,  if  he  had  not  already  sinned  as  deeply  as  the  Magdalene,  was 
liable  from  his  spiritual  pride  to  fall  into  as  great  a sin.  S.  Augustine 
(in  loc.  at.).  Hence  in  many  things  the  Pharisee  offended,  as  Toletus 
shows.  Therefore,  S.  Gregory  (Horn.  33),  concludes  thus : “ We 
should  in  another’s  fall  lament  our  own  sin;  for  perhaps,  under 
similar  circumstances,  we  should  in  like  manner  offend,  and 
although  punishment  should  always  follow  on  sin,  we  ought  to 
make  a distinction,  to  be  harsh  and  severe  in  our  treatment  of  vice, 
but  to  be  compassionate  to  the  weakness  of  human  nature.  For 
though  the  sinner  must  be  punished,  he  must  be  gently  dealt  with, 
as  our  neighbour.” 

Ver.  40. — And  Jesus  answering  (the  secret  thoughts  of  his  heart) 
said  unto  him , Simon , I have  somewhat  to  say  unto  thee. 

S.  Augustine,  Theophylact,  Bede  and  others,  think  that  this 
Simon  was  not  Simon  the  leper,  in  whose  house  the  Magdalene 
again  anointed  the  feet  of  Jesus.  S.  John  xii.  2,  S.  Matt  xxvi.  6. 
Others  are  of  a contrary  opinion,  because  the  name  is  the  same,  and 
because  the  circumstances  of  the  second  anointing  are  so  similar. 
It  seems,  however,  that  this  Simon  was  converted  when  Christ  was 
on  his  way  from  Galilee  to  Judsea  (S.  Matt  xix.  1);  and  that  he 
followed  Jesus,  and  settled  at  Bethany,  near  S.  Mary  Magdalene, 
who  was  known  to  him,  in  order  to  enjoy  with  her  the  presence  and 
teaching  of  Christ

PARABLE  OF  THE  TWO  DEBTORS. 


207 


Simon  with  these  gentle  but  meaning  words,  which  appealed  to  his 
better  feelings,  and  at  once  arrested  his  attention.  For,  as  S.  Augus- 
tine says,  Christ  desired  to  correct  the  error  of  his  thoughts,  in  return 
for  the  entertainment  which  he  had  provided  And  S.  Luke  implies 
that  Simon  at  once  recognised  his  fault,  for  he  answered  modestly, 
Master,  say  on.  As  Thy  disciple,  I will  gladly  accept  Thy  words  as 
the  teaching  of  my  Master. 

Ver.  41. — There  was  a certain  creditor  which  had  two  debtors . 
The  debtors,  says  S.  Ambrose,  are  those  who  owe  God,  the  heavenly 
creditor,  not  actual  money,  but  a return  of  good  works  and  of 
virtue.  Our  debts,  therefore,  are  our  sins,  by  which  we  do  despite 
to  God,  and  for  which  we  should  make  atonement  But  we  cannot 
make  atonement  unto  God,  and  therefore  are  in  danger  of  hell  fire. 
For  the  Syriac  creditor  implies  the  same  as  usurer,  and  the  Greek 
word  dapt/erfy  answers  to  the  Hebrew  HIM*  nosche,  and  signifies 
one  who  gives,  either  outright,  or  on  usuiy.  Deut.  xv.  6,  xxviii.  12  ; 
Ecclus.  xxix.  1 and  2. 

One  owed  five  hundred  fence  and  the  other  fifty . The  Roman 
denarius  or  penny,  originally  of  the  value  of  ten  asses,  was  worth 
about  eight  pence  of  our  modern  money.  In  this  parable  we  are  to 
understand  by  the  two  debtors,  Mary  Magdalene,  and  Simon  the 
Pharisee ; who  is  not  mentioned  by  name,  lest  he  should  be  offended 
or  disheartened.  This  is  clear  from  the  following  verses  wherein 
the  Magdalene  is  thrice,  by  antithesis,  brought  into  comparison  with 
Simon,  and  preferred  to  him.  She,  therefore,  is  the  debtor  who 
owed  five  hundred  pence,  who  considered  that  she  owed  God  much 
more  because  of  her  sins  than  Simon ; and  therefore,  that  she  might 
obtain  forgiveness,  she  loved  more  and  showed  greater  proofs  of 
her  love.  But  Simon  owed  only  fifty  pence,  his  sins  were  but  venial, 
and  therefore  he  considered  that  he  owed  little  to  God.  He  was  self- 
righteous,  and  thought  that  he  had  little  or  no  need  of  repentance. 

But  S.  Augustine  rightly  observes,  for  this  very  reason  he  ought 
all  the  more  to  acknowledge  that  he  was  a debtor  to  God,  who 
had  preserved  him  from  committing  greater  offences.  Thou  wast 
not  an  adulterer  (as  the  Magdalene)  in  that  past  life  of  thine

which  thou  dost  ignore.  But  it  was  God  who  kept  thee  from 
sinning,  preserved  thee  from  temptation,  and  from  the  power  of  the 
tempter.  Acknowledge  then  what  thou  owest  to  Him  who  has  kept 
thee  from  eviL  For  there  is  no  sin  which  one  man  has  committed 
that  another  man  may  not  commit,  if  God  withdraw  His  guidance 
from  him. 

Ver.  42. — And  when  they  had  nothing  to  pay , he  frankly  forgave 
them  both.  Tell  me  therrforet  which  of  them  will  love  him  mostf 
(loves  him  most,  Vulg.)  i.e.  “in  verity,”  or  “ought”  to  love  him 
most.  For  a similar  Hebraism,  see  Amos  v.  13.  The  prudent  shall 
keep  silence  in  that  time,  ue \ they  were  being  silent  or  it  behoved 
them  to  be  silent 

The  meaning  is,  As  he  who  has  been  forgiven  much,  is  accounted 
to  have  received  forgiveness  because  of  his  deserts,  so  debtors 
who  owe  much,  are  wont  to  show  the  utmost  deference  to  their 
creditors,  in  order  to  obtain  from  them,  if  not  forgiveness  of 
their  debt,  at  least  favourable  terms  of  payment  In  like  manner, 
Simon,  thou  shouldest  have  known  that  the  Magdalene  loved  me 
with  a greater  love  than  thine.  For  she  showed  greater  proofs  of 
her  love,  and  therefore  her  sins,  which  are  many,  are.  forgiven,  be- 
cause she  loved  much.  Wherefore,  she  is  no  longer  a sinner,  nor, 
as  thou  thinkest,  unworthy  to  touch  my  feet ; but  holier  than  thou, 
and  more  worthy  to  be  touched  by  me.  The  parable,  therefore, 
plainly  teaches  us,  that  the  more  we  love,  the  more  we  shall  be 
forgivea 

So  S.  Augustine  (Horn.  23),  “ The  more  she  loved  Me,  and  shows 
her  love,  the  more  do  I forgive.”  But  if  we  take  the  Greek  render- 
ing and  translate  according  to  the  English  version,  the 

argument  is  inverted.  For  although  the  love  of  the  creditor,  as 
shown  in  the  forgiveness  of  the  debt,  excites  in  return  the  love  of  the 
debtor,  yet  at  the  same  time  it  is  the  love  of  the  debtor,  in  seeking 
to  make  payment  of  the  debt,  which  causes  the  creditor  to  forgive. 
So  De  Lyra,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others.  Hence  the  parable  in  one 
sense  teaches  us,  that  as  the  debtor  who  has  been  forgiven  the  most, 
loves  his  creditor  the  more,  so  Christ  because  he  had  forgiven  the

CHRIST'S  APPLICATION  OF  SIMON'S  ANSWER.  209 

many  sins  of  the  Magdalene,  will  be  the  more  beloved  by  her.  But 
Christ  desired  also  to  show,  not  only  that  her  sins  were  forgiven,  but 
the  reason,  and  the  manner  of  their  forgiveness,  i.e.  on  account  of 
her  love,  so  that  we,  taking  example  by  her,  may,  in  like  manner 
obtain  forgiveness. 

Another  explanation  is  given  by  S.  Ambrose  (De  Tobia,  cap . xxii.) 
Christ  forgave  the  sins  of  the  Magdalene,  which  increased  her  love 
and  gratitude  to  Him ; but  Christ  foresaw  this  increase  of  love,  and 
therefore  from  the  very  first  forgave  her.  Again,  S.  Gregory  (lib.  vl 
epist  32),  and  after  him  Toletus:  The  greater  the  debt  which  is 
forgiven  the  greater  the  gratitude  of  the  debtor.  When,  therefore, 
O Simon,  thou  sawest  in  the  Magdalene  such  great  signs  of  love, 
thou  shouldest  have  inferred  how  much  had  been  forgiven  her. 
For  as  the  cause  may  be  inferred, from  the  effect,  so  her  love  was 
the  result  of  her  forgiveness.  See  then  how  rashly  thou  hast  con- 
demned this  woman,  when  thou  shouldest  have  known,  from  the 
abundant  signs  of  love  and  gratitude  which  she  had  shown,  that  all 
her  sins,  however  great  their  number,  had  been  forgiven.  But  this 
interpretation  is  at  variance  with  the  47th  verse,  “ Her  sins,  which 
are  many,  are  forgiven,  for  she  loved  much.”  The  word  “ for  ” or 
“ because  ” shows  that  her  love  was  not  the  effect  but  the  cause  of  her 
forgiveness.  See  infra,  v.  47. 

Ver.  43. — Simon  answered  and  said,  I suppose  that  he  to  whom 
he  forgave  most.  And  He  said  unto  him.  Thou  hast  rightly  judged \ 
Christ  praises  the  answer,  in  order  that  Simon  might  the  more 
readily  accept  the  reproof  and  the  lessons  to  be  drawn  therefrom. 

Ver.  44. — And  He  turned  unto  the  woman , and  said  unto  Simon, 
Seest  thou  this  woman  t He  turned,  because  the  Magdalene  stood 
behind  Him,  for  from  consciousness  of  her  guilt,  she  did  not  dare 
to  meet  His  sight  Seest  thou  this  woman?  no  longer,  as  thou 
thinkest,  a sinner,  but  a penitent  reconciled  with  God.

It  was  the  custom  in  those  days  to  wash  the  feet  of  one’s  guests 
before  they  sat  down  to  meat,  both  for  purposes  of  cleansing  and 

refreshment  Thus  Abraham  washed  the  feet  of  the  Angels,  Gen,

xviii.  4,  and  Lot,  Gen.  xix.  2.  See  also  Judges  xix.  21.  Whence 
S.  Paul  considers  that  a widow  may  be  set  apart  for  the  service 
of  God,  “if  she  have  washed  the  saints*  feet,”  1 Tim.  v.  10.  * 

Christ  had  come  as  a guest  to  the  house,  and  therefore  Simon 
should  have  washed  His  feet  Christ  therefore  reproached  him  for 
his  want  of  consideration  and  care,  and  contrasts  his  conduct  with 
the  love  of  the  Magdalene.  For  Titus  says,  “ It  is  an  easy  matter  to 
provide  water,  but  difficult  to  supply  such  an  abundance  of  tears.” 

Ver.  45. — Thou  gavest  Me  no  kiss , but  this  woman,  since  the  time  1 
tame  in , hath  not  ceased  to  kiss  My  feet , “ with  reverence  and  godly 
fear.”  Titus.  Guests  were  in  old  times  received  with  a kiss  in  sign 
of  affection  and  welcome.  But  Simon  omitted  this  salutation. 
Hence  “ It  was  thy  duty,  O Simon,  to  receive  Me,  thy  invited  guest, 
with  a kiss  of  welcome,  but  the  Magdalene  has  more  than  made  up 
for  thy  neglect,  for  she  hath  continued  to  kiss,  not  My  face,  but  My 
feet,  from  the  moment  I entered  Thy  house.” 

Ver.  46. — My  head  with  oil  thou  didst  not  anoint:  but  this  woman 
hath  anointed  My  feet  with  ointment.  The  more  valued  the  guest, 
the  more  precious  the  perfumes  wherewith  He  was  anointed. 
Thou  didst  not  anoint  My  head,  but  she  hath  anointed  My  feet  with 
very  precious  ointment  See  again  how  she  excelleth  thee  in  love 
and  devotion.  “ Not  that  the  Lord,”  as  Ambrose  says,  44  valued  the 
ointment,  but  rather  the  love,  the  faith,  and  the  humility.”  Hence 
Christ  concludes, 

Ver.  47. — Wherefore  I say  unto  thee , Her  sins,  which  are  many,  are 
forgiven  ; for  she  loved  much.  Greek,  afootnrou,  have  been  forgiven. 
At  what  time,  we  may  ask,  were  her  sins  forgiven  ? 

1.  Francis  Lucas  thinks  at  the  time  when  the  Lord  said  unto  her, 
M Thy  sins  are  forgiven,”  v.  48. 

2.  Others  are  of  opinion  that  her  sins  were  forgiven  when  our 
Lord  in  this  present  verse  declared  unto  Simon  the  fact  of  her 
pardon. 

3.  But  it  seems  more  probable  that  her  sins  were  forgiven  at  some 
time  antecedent,  ue.  when  she  felt  true  contrition  for  her  offences. 
Because  when  by  the  grace  of  God  she  had  been  led  to  see  the

the  Magdalene's  sins  forgiven. 


21 1 


heinousness  of  her  sin,  so  deep  was  her  contrition  and  sorrow,  that 
she  thereby  regained  the  divine  favour,  and  so  her  love  for  God  and 
her  sorrow  for  her  sins  impelled  her  to  show  openly  the  reality  of 
her  repentance,  and  therefore  before  Christ  could  say  unto  her,  “ Thy 
sins  are  forgiven,”  she  had  obtained  forgiveness  by  reason  of  her 
complete  penitence. 

We  may,  however,  take  the  words  “ her  sins  are  forgiven  ” as 
spoken  in  the  same  sense  in  which  the  priest  pronounces  absolution 
over  a penitent,  who  is  already  reconciled  to  God  by  his  perfect 
repentance.  The  priest  absolves  him  who  is  already  absolved,  and 
this  absolution  is  so  effectual  as  to  do  away  with  any  sin  which  might 
still  attach  itself  to  the  penitent  Further,  a sin  often  repeated  may 
be  often  forgiven,  if  the  penitent  confesses  his  fault  as  often  as  he 
commits  it,  and  seeks  absolution  at  the  h finds  of  the  Church. 
Hence  Christ  for  the  third  time  forgives  the  sins  of  the  Magdalene. 
Wherefore  He  freed  her  not  only  from  the  guilt  but  from  the  punish- 
ment of  sin,  and  granted  her  free  release. 

This  is  what  the  angel  said  to  a certain  Bishop  of  the  Church : 
“ Penitence  and  confession  restore  the  penitent  to  the  number  of 
the  elect”  Again,  “ The  tears  of  a penitent  may  well  bear  the  name 
of  a baptism.”  Barlaam.  And  Palladius  tells  us,  that  a certain 
virgin  who  had  fallen  into  sin  “ was  more  pleasing  to  God  in  her 
penitence,  than  in  her  former  purity.”  See  also  S.  Jerome  (De 
pcenitentia  Fabiold ) ; and  Climacus  (De  pcenitentia^) 

For  she  laved  much . Toletus  and  some  others  think  that  the  word 
“for”  signifies  not  the  cause  but  rather  affords  the  proof  of  her 
forgiveness.  “ Thou  mightest  have  known,  O Simon,  that  her  sins 
were  forgiven,  for  these  open  signs  of  love  are  bestowed  on  Me  in 
gratitude  for  my  forgiveness  of  her  sins.” 

But  this  explanation  is  faulty,  because  the  Magdalene  knew  not 
that  she  had  been  forgiven,  until  she  heard  Christ  pronounce  the 
pardon  of  her  sins.  And  Christ  does  not  say,  Learn  from  her  acts 
of  love  that  her  sins  have  been  forgiven,  but  on  the  contrary,  Her 
sins  are  forgiven  because  of  her  love. 

Hence  the  cause  of  the  Magdalene’s  forgiveness  was  her  great  love

S.  LUKE,  C.  VII. 


for  God,  which  led  her  to  hate  and  abhor  her  former  sins.  For 
love  is  the  death  of  sin,  and  the  life  of  righteousness.  S. 
Augustin  (De  laudibus  chariiaiis.)  Hence  ail  theologians  hold  with 
him,  that  the  act  ot  perfect  contrition  which  includes  the  entire 
surrender  of  the  heart  to  God,  precedes,  but  at  once  brings  with 
it  justification  and  forgiveness  of  sin  as  its  final  result,  in  the  same 
way  as  a certain  amount  of  heat  (calor  ut  octo)  applied  to  wood,  as 
a result  produces  actual  fire  in  that  wood. 

So  the  Council  of  Trent  (Sess.  xiv.  cap . iv.),  distinguishing  between 
the  attrition  caused  by  fear  of  punishment  and  the  contrition  which 
follows  on  the  love  of  God,  decides  that  the  latter,  in  conjunction 
with  the  sacrament  of  penance,  reconciles  the  sinner  with  God, 
which  the  former  is  in  no  wise  able  to  do ; for  “ a broken  and  a 
contrite  heart,  O God,  thou  wilt  not  despise,”  Ps.  1L  17.  Hence 
S.  Gregory  (Horn.  33)  explains,  “Her  sins,  which  are  many,  are 
forgiven,  for  she  loved  much,  $.e.  she  burnt  off  the  corruptions  of 
sin,  because  she  was  inflamed  with  the  fire  of  love.  For  the  more 
the  heart  of  the  sinner  bums  with  the  love  of  God  the  more  is  he 
purified  from  the  lust  and  corruption  of  sin.” 

But  to  whom  little  is  forgiven,  the  same  loveth  little.  This  refers  to 
the  Pharisee,  because  he  obtained  no  forgiveness,  inasmuch  as  he 
showed  no  signs  of  penitence  or  of  love  for  God.  Our  Lord,  under 
reserve,  saith  little  or  ‘‘less,”  as  the  Vulgate  renders  it,  is  forgiven, 
though  he  might  have  said  “nothing”  is  forgiven.  But  by  the 
words  “ to  whom  little  is  forgiven,  the  same  loveth  little,”  we  may 
understand : 

1.  That,  according  to  the  principles  on  which  God  forgives  sins, 
“one  mortal  sin,  even  though  it  be  the  least,  cannot  be  forgiven 
without  its  accompanying  sins  being  forgiven  also,  and  whensoever 
one  is  forgiven,  the  others  are  forgiven  as  far  as  the  guilt  is  con- 
cerned, but  more  or  less  of  punishment  is  meted  out,  according 
to  the  degree  of  love  which  fills  the  heart  of  the  penitent” 

2.  That  he  who  has  no  love  for  God,  or  only  that  natural  love 
which  well  nigh  all  men  possess,  loves  God  less  than  one  whose 
love  is  divinely  inspired.  Hence  to  the  one  many,  i.e.  all  his  sins,

are  pardoned ; to  the  other  less,  t\e.  nothing,  is  forgiven.  All  was 
forgiven  the  Magdalene  because  she  was  truly  contrite,  and  sought 
forgiveness  by  every  means  in  her  power ; but  the  Pharisee  received 
no  forgiveness,  because  he  felt  no  sorrow  for  sin,  and  had  not  even 
given  the  feast  with  any  desire  of  obtaining  mercy  from  Christ 

For  Christ  designed  the  parable  to  apply  to  S.  Mary  Mag- 
dalene and  also  to  the  Pharisee,  and  willed  from  it  to  show 
why  the  one  was  forgiven  but  the  other  not  S.  Augustine  adds, 
"The  parable  was  spoken  because  the  Pharisee  thought  he  had 
few,  if  any  sins,  not  because  he  had  no  love,  for  he  showed  some 
love  in  that  he  invited  our  Lord.”  And  again,  " O Pharisee,  thou 
lovest  little,  not  because  little  is  forgiven  thee,  but  because  thou 
thoughtest  that  there  was  little  which  needed  forgiveness.”  Toletus 
remarks,  " Little  was  forgiven  Simon,  because  by  the  grace  of  God 
he  had  been  preserved  from  committing  sin,  for  he  had  entertained 
Christ,  and  not  persecuted  him  as  the  other  Pharisees.  Hence  it 
is  very  probable  that  afterwards  this  Pharisee  became  a true  follower 
of  Christ”  See  further  Suarez,  Parte  iii.,  de  Gratia , lib.  viii.  cap.  x. 

Ver.  48. — And  He  said  unto  her , Thy  sins  are  forgiven.  Francis 
Lucas  thinks  that  the  Magdalene’s  sins  were  at  this  time  and  by  these 
words  forgiven.  See  preceding  verse.  Christ  now  turns  to  the 
Magdalene,  and  repeats  that  which  He  had  said  just  before  to  Simon, 
in  order  to  comfort  her  grief,  to  confirm  her  pardon,  and  show  that 
He  had  power  and  authority  to  forgive  sins,  and  that  He  therefore 
was  the  Messiah,  and  God.  Euthymius. 

Ver.  49. — And  they  that  sat  at  meat  with  Him  began  to  say  within 
themselves,  ie.  to  reason  in  their  hearts,  for  they  did  not  dare  to 
express  their  thoughts  lest  they  should  be  put  to  rebuke. 

Who  is  this  that  forgiveth  sins  also  t Is  it  the  Messiah  ? Is  it 
God,  for  God  alone  can  forgive  sins  1 Christ  leaves  them  a prey  to 
wonder  and  to  doubt,  in  order  that  they  might  be  led  to  inquire 
into  His  life,  doctrine  and  miracles,  and  see  in  Him  the  Son 
of  God. 

Ver.  50. — And  He  saith  to  the  woman,  Thy  faith  hath  saved  thee ; 
go  in  peace . Faith,  not  alone,  as  the  innovators  hold,  but  fruitful  in

good  works,  such  as  the  Magdalene  had  displayed,  and  love.  For 
a little  before,  v.  47,  Christ  had  ascribed  her  forgiveness  to  her  love. 
We  must  here  understand,  therefore,  not  a barren  faith,  but  a faith 
which  showed  itself  in  her  acts  of  contrition  and  love. 

Hath  saved  thee , t.e.  hath  freed  thee  from  sin,  and  made  thee  meet 
for  salvation.  Thy  loving  faith  hath  placed  thee  in  the  way  of 
salvation,  and  if  thou  continuest  therein,  thou  wilt  lay  hold  upon 
eternal  life,  for  a readiness  to  serve  God  is  the  way  to  glory. 

Go  in  peace . Be  no  longer  downcast  and  distressed  by  reason  of 
thy  sins : they  have  now  no  power  to  hurt  thee,  nor  to  make  thy  con- 
science afraid.  Euthymius.  The  fruit  of  repentance,  forgiveness, 
and  of  a conscience  void  of  offence,  is  peace  and  spiritual  joys, 
which  far  exceed  those  which  the  world  can  give,  as  it  is  written, 
M Being  justified  by  faith,  we  have  peace  with  God  ” Rom.  v.  1 ; and 
again,  “ The  peace  of  God,  which  passeth  all  understanding,  shall 
keep  your  hearts  and  minds  through  Jesus  Christ,”  Phil.  iv.  7. 
So  also,  “He  that  is  of  a merry  heart  hath  a continual  feast,” 
Prov.  xv.  15. 

S.  Bernard,  in  his  sermon  on  the  Magdalene,  very  fitly  remarks, 
11  The  joy  which  a perfect  heart  looks  for  from  an  untroubled  con- 
science is  a lasting  happiness.  For  the  heart  which  is  cleansed  from 
this  world’s  corruptions,  and  whose  desires  are  fixed  on  God,  joys 
only  in  the  Lord,  and  rejoices  only  in  God  its  Saviour.  The  soul  of 
such  an  one  despises  the  threats  of  the  enemy,  casts  away  fear,  is 
not  a prey  to  false  hopes,  but,  secure  against  all  evil,  rests  in 
perfect  peace.” 

This  perfect  peace  Christ  gave  to  the  Magdalene,  for  God’s  work 
is  perfect  (Deut  xxxii.  4),  and  therefore  those  whom  Christ  cleansed 
were  made  perfectly  whole.  He  therefore, 

1.  Uprooted  from  the  Magdalene’s  heart  all  vicious  habits,  all 
evil  recollections  and  fleshly  lusts,  and  restored  to  her  true  peace 
of  mind. 

2.  Endued  her,  not  only  with  chastity,  humility  and  penitence, 
but  also  with, 

3.  A contempt  for  earthly  things,  and  a love  for  heavenly ; and

4.  Kindled  in  her  heart  an  ardent  love,  which  caused  her  to 
dedicate  herself  and  all  she  had  to  His  service. 

Hence  she  followed  Christ  as  He  went  about  the  villages  preach- 
ing, and  ministered  unto  Him  of  her  substance,  resigning  the  cares 
of  the  family  to  her  sister  Martha,  that  she  might  wholly  devote 
herself  to  the  teaching  of  the  Lord. 

Hence  she  heard  from  His  lips  the  words,  “ Mary  hath  chosen 
that  good  part,  which  shall  not  be  taken  away  from  her,19  S.  Luke 
xi.  42.  Hence  also  she  stood  at  the  foot  of  the  Cross,  and  beheld 
Christ  washing  away,  by  His  blood,  those  sins  which  she  had  washed 
with  her  tears,  and  afterwards,  with  a yet  more  fervent  love,  with- 
drawing into  the  desert,  she  gave  herself  up  to  the  contemplation 
of  His  life,  His  passion  and  His  resurrection,  and,  wholly  devoted 
to  His  service,  lived  henceforth  for  heaven  and  not  for  earth. 

Such  also  was  the  conversion  of  S.  Paul,  and  therefore  he  was 
endued  with  all  Christian  and  Apostolic  virtues.  See  Acts  ix.  A 
similar  conversion  of  heart  and  mind,  we  are  told,  was  experienced 
by  S.  Cyprian  at  his  baptism  (Lib.  ii.  Epist.  2,  ad  Donat.) ; and  by  S. 
Augustin  (Confess,  lib.  ix  cap . i.,  lib.  viii.  cap.  ii.) 

Wherefore  Origen,  in  his  noble  Homily  on  the  Magdalene,  figura- 
tively says,  M We  may  follow  the  example  of  this  woman,  in  order  to 
obtain  a similar  blessing.  For  we  may  confidently  draw  nigh  unto 
Jesus,  since  He  did  not  withdraw  Himself  from  the  sinner  who 
sought  Him.  Learn  then  from  her,  O sinner,  to  mourn  over  the 
absence  of  God  from  thy  soul,  and  to  seek  His  presence  again. 
Learn  from  Mary  to  love  Jesus,  to  hope  in  Jesus,  and  by  seeking 
Jesus  to  find  Him.  Learn  from  her  to  fear  no  opposition,  to  refuse 
to  be  comforted  without  Him,  and  to  count  all  things  but  loss  for 
His  sake.  Hence  see  the  power  of  grace,  and  of  the  love  of  Christ” 

“ Love  conquers  all  things.”  u Love  can  control  the  savage  lion, 
and  love  alone  has  power  to  lead  captive  the  hearts  of  men,”  for 
“ love  is  strong  as  death,”  Cant  viii.  6.

CHAPTER  VIII. 

3  Women  minister  unto  Christ  of  their  substance \ 4 Christ,  after  he  had  preached 

from  place  to  place , attended  with  his  apostles , propounded  the  parable  of  the 
sower  16  And  of  the  candle . 21  Declared  who  are  his  mother , and  brethren. 

22  Rebuketh  the  winds . 26  Casteth  the  legion  of  devils  out  of  the  man  into  the 
herd  of  swine.  37  Is  rejected  of  the  Gadarenes.  43  Healed  the  woman  of  her 
bloody  issue.  49  And  raised  from  death  f aims'  daughter. 

AND  it  came  to  pass  afterward,  that  he  went  throughout  every  city  and  village, 
preaching  and  showing  the  glad  tidings  of  the  kingdom  of  God  : and  the 
twelve  were  with  him, 

2 And  certain  women,  which  had  been  healed  of  evil  spirits  and  infirmities, 
Mary  called  Magdalene,  out  of  whom  went  seven  devils, 

3 And  Joanna  the  wife  of  Chuza  Herod’s  steward,  and  Susanna,  and  many 
others,  which  ministered  unto  him  of  their  substance. 

4  And  when  much  people  were  gathered  together,  and  were  come  to  him  out 
of  every  city,  he  spake  by  a parable  : 

5  A sower  went  out  to  sow  his  seed  : and  as  he  sowed,  some  fell  by  the  way 
side ; and  it  was  trodden  down,  and  the  fowls  of  the  air  devoured  it. 

6  And  some  fell  upon  a rock ; and  as  soon  as  it  was  sprang  up,  it  withered 
away,  because  it  lacked  moisture. 

7  And  some  fell  among  thorns;  and  the  thorns  sprang  up  with  it,  and  choked  it 
8 And  other  fell  on  good  ground,  and  sprang  up,  and  bare  fruit  an  hundred- 
fold. And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  he  cried,  He  that  hath  ears  to  hear, 
let  him  hear. 

9  And  his  disciples  asked  him,  saying,  What  might  this  parable  be  ? 

10  And  he  said,  Unto  you  it  is  given  to  know  the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of 
God  : but  to  others  in  parables ; that  seeing  they  might  not  see,  and  hearing  they 
might  not  understand. 

11  Now  the  parable  is  this : The  seed  is  the  word  of  God. 

IS  Those  by  the  way  side  are  they  that  hear ; then  cometh  the  devil,  and  taketh 
away  the  word  out  of  their  hearts,  lest  they  should  believe  and  be  saved. 

13  They  on  the  rock  are  they,  which,  when  they  hear,  receive  the  word  with 
joy  ; and  these  have  no  root,  which  for  a while  believe,  and  in  time  of  temptation 
fall  away. 

14  And  that  which  fell  among  thorns  are  they,  which,  when  they  have  heard, 
go  forth,  and  are  choked  with  cares  and  riches  and  pleasures  of  this  life,  and  bring 
no  fruit  to  perfection.

15  Bat  that  on  the  good  ground  are  they,  which  in  an  honest  and  good  heart, 
having  heard  the  word,  keep  and  bring  forth  fruit  with  patience. 

16  No  man,  when  he  hath  lighted  a candle,  covereth  it  with  a vessel,  or  putteth 
it  under  a bed;  but  setteth  it  on  a candlestick,  that  they  which  enter  in  may  see 
the  light 

17  For  nothing  is  secret,  that  shall  not  be  made  manifest ; neither  anything 
hid,  that  shall  not  be  known  and  come  abroad. 

18  Take  heed  therefore  how  ye  hear  t for  whosoever  hath,  to  him  shall  be 
given ; and  whosoever  hath  not,  from  him  shall  be  taken  even  that  which  he 
seemeth  to  have. 

19  Then  came  to  him  hi*  mother  and  his  brethren,  and  could  not  come  at 
him  for  the  press. 

20  And  it  was  told  him  by  certain  which  said,  Thy  mother  and  thy  brethren 
stand  without,  desiring  to  see  thee. 

21  And  he  answered  and  said  unto  them,  My  mother  and  my  brethren  are 
these  which  hear  the  word  of  God,  and  do  it. 

22  Now  it  came  to  pass  on  a certain  day,  that  he  went  into  a ship  with  his 
disciples  : and  he  said  unto  them,  Let  us  go  over  unto  the  other  side  of  the 
lake.  And  they  launched  forth. 

23  But  as  they  sailed  he  fell  asleep  : and  there  came  down  a storm  of  wind  on 
the  lake ; and  they  were  filled  with  water,  and  were  in  jeopardy. 

24  And  they  came  to  him,  and  awoke  him,  saying,  Master,  master,  we  perish. 
Then  he  arose,  and  rebuked  the  wind  and  the  raging  of  the  water : and  they 
ceased,  and  there  was  a calm. 

25  And  he  said  unto  them,  Where  is  your  faith?  And  they  being  afraid 
wondered,  saying  one  to  another,  What  manner  of  man  is  this ! for  he  com- 
manded! even  the  winds  and  water,  and  they  obey  him. 

26  And  they  arrived  at  the  country  of  the  Gadarenes,  which  is  over  against 
Galilee. 

27  And  when  he  went  forth  to  land,  there  met  him  out  of  the  city  a certain 
man,  which  had  devils  long  time,  and  ware  no  clothes,  neither  abode  in  any 
house,  but  in  the  tombs. 

28  When  he  saw  Jesus,  he  cried  out,  and  fell  down  before  him,  and  with  a 
loud  voice  said,  What  have  I to  do  with  thee,  Jesus,  thou  Son  of  God  most  high  ? 
I beseech  thee,  torment  me  not 

29  (For  he  had  commanded  the  unclean  spirit  to  come  out  of  the  man.  For 
oftentimes  it  had  caught  him  : and  he  was  kept  bound  with  chains  and  in  fetters ; 
and  he  brake  the  bands,  and  was  driven  of  the  devil  into  the  wilderness.) 

30  And  Jesus  asked  him,  saying,  What  is  thy  name  ? And  he  said,  Legion  : 
because  many  devils  were  entered  into  him. 

31  And  they  besought  him  that  he  would  not  command  them  to  go  out  into 
the  deep. 

32  And  there  was  there  an  herd  of  many  swine  feeding  on  the  mountain  1 and 
they  besought  him  that  he  would  suffer  them  to  enter  into  them.  And  he 
suffered  them. 

33  Then  went  the  devils  out  of  the  man,  and  entered  into  the  swine  : and  the 
herd  ran  violently  down  a steep  place  into  the  lake,  and  were  choked. 

34  When  they  that  fed  them  saw  what  was  done,  they  fled,  and  went  and  told 
it  in  the  city  and  in  the  country.

S.  LUKE,  C.  VIII. 


35  Then  they  went  out  to  see  what  was  done  ; and  came  to  Jesus,  and  found 
the  man,  out  of  whom  the  devils  were  departed,  sitting  at  the  feet  of  Jesus, 
clothed,  and  in  his  right  mind  : and  they  were  afraid. 

36  They  also  which  saw  it  told  them  by  what  means  he  that  was  possessed  of 
the  devils  was  healed. 

37  Then  the  whole  multitude  of  the  country  of  the  Gadarenes  round  about 
besought  him  to  depart  from  them  ; for  they  were  taken  with  great  fear : and  he 
went  up  into  the  ship,  and  returned  back  again. 

38  Now  the  man  out  of  whom  the  devils  were  departed  besought  him  that  he 
might  be  with  him  : but  Jesus  sent  him  away,  saying, 

39  Return  to  thine  own  house,  and  shew  how  great  things  God  hath  done  unto 
thee.  And  he  went  his  way,  and  published  throughout  the  whole  city  how  great 
things  Jesus  had  done  unto  him. 

40  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  when  Jesus  was  returned,  the  people  gladly  re- 
ceived him  : for  they  were  all  waiting  for  him. 

41  And,  behold,  there  came  a man  named  Jairus,  and  he  was  a ruler  of  the 
synagogue  : and  he  fell  down  at  Jesus'  feet,  and  besought  him  that  he  would  come 
into  his  house : 

42  For  he  had  one  only  daughter,  about  twelve  years  of  age,  and  she  lay  a 
dying.  But  as  he  went  the  people  thronged  him. 

43  And  a woman  having  an  issue  of  blood  twelve  years,  which  had  spent  all 
her  living  upon  physicians,  neither  could  be  healed  of  any, 

44  Came  behind  him , and  touched  the  border  of  his  garment : and  immediately 
her  issue  of  blood  stanched. 

45  And  Jesus  said,  Who  touched  me?  When  all  denied,  Peter  and  they  that 
were  with  him  said,  Master,  the  multitude  throng  thee  and  press  thee,  and  sayest 
thou,  Who  touched  me  ? 

46  And  Jesus  said,  Somebody  hath  touched  me : for  I perceive  that  virtue  is 
gone  out  of  me. 

47  And  when  the  woman  saw  that  she  was  not  hid,  she  came  trembling,  and 
falling  down  before  him,  she  declared  unto  him  before  all  the  people  for  what  cause 
she  had  touched  him,  and  how  she  was  healed  immediately. 

48  And  he  said  unto  her,  Daughter,  be  of  good  comfort : thy  faith  hath  made 
thee  whole ; go  in  peace. 

49  While  he  yet  spake,  there  cometh  one  from  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue's 
howet  saying  to  him,  Thy  daughter  is  dead  ; trouble  not  the  Master. 

50  But  when  Jesus  heard  it%  he  answered  him,  saying,  Fear  not : believe  only, 
and  she  shall  be  made  whole. 

51  And  when  he  came  into  the  house,  he  suffered  no  man  to  go  in,  save  Peter, 
and  James,  and  John,  and  the  father  and  the  mother  of  the  maiden. 

52  And  all  wept,  and  bewailed  her : but  he  said,  Weep  not ; she  is  not  dead, 
but  sleepeth. 

53  And  they  laughed  him  to  scorn,  knowing  that  she  was  dead. 

54  And  he  put  them  all  out,  and  took  her  by  the  hand,  and  called,  saying, 
Maid,  arise. 

55  And  her  spirit  came  again,  and  she  arose  straightway : and  he  commanded 
to  give  her  meat 

56  And  her  parents  were  astonished : but  he  charged  them  that  they  should  tell 
no  man  what  was  done.

THE  WOMEN  WHO  FOLLOWED  CHRIST. 


219 


Ver.  1. — And  the  twelve  (apostles)  were  with  Him , i.e.  they  accom- 
panied Jesus  as  He  went  through  the  cities  and  villages  preaching. 

Ver.  2. — And  certain  women,  which  had  been  healed  of  evil  spirits 
and  infirmities,  Mary  called  Magdalene,  out  of  whom  went  seven  devils . 
These  women  followed  Christ  (1.)  out  of  gratitude,  because  He 
had  healed  their  diseases,  and  cast  out  the  devils  which  possessed 
them.  (2.)  For  safety,  lest  if  they  were  away  from  their  physician, 
their  former  ills  might  again  overtake  them.  (3.)  From  pious 
motives,  that  from  His  companionship  and  preaching  they  might 
advance  in  holiness. 

Mary . In  Hebrew,  Mary  signifies  a “ bitter  sea  ” of  repentance. 
Bede. 

Called  Magdalene.  As  we  have  before  explained,  from  the  castle 
or  fort  near  Bethsaida  and  Capernaum.  S.  Augustin  infers  that 
she  was  a married  woman  (Horn.  33),  and  therefore  calls  her  not 
a harlot  but  an  adulteress.  But  according  to  S.  Jerome,  the 
author  of  the  commentary  on  S.  Mark  calls  her  a widow,  which  is 
much  the  same  thing ; so  also  Jansenius,  Luke  and  others.  That 
she  was  an  inhabitant  of  Judaea,  and  like  Lazarus  and  Martha  lived 
at  Bethany,  is  clear  from  SI  John  xii.  1.  Adricomius,  in  his  descrip- 
tion of  the  Holy  Land,  tells  us  that  the  Magdalene’s  home  was 
situated  on  the  shore  of  the  sea  of  Galilee,  and  towards  the  north- 
east looks  out  on  an  extensive  plain,  and  that  it  was  called  Magdala 
from  the  battlements  and  towers,  wherewith  it  was  fortified.  Hence 
Jerome  asserts  that  she  was  rightly  called  Magdalene,  that  is 
to  say,  " turreted  ” because  of  her  zeal  and  love.  Josephus  makes 
mention  of  this  castle,  and  tells  us  that  Agrippa  fruitlessly  sent  an 
expedition  against  it 

In  the  Hebrew  then  Magdalene  signifies  (1.)  turreted,  or  tower- 
bearing, from  the  root  migdol,  a tower;  for  she  was  tall  of 

stature,  and  of  a yet  loftier  mind.  u Thy  neck  is  like  the  tower  of 
David,”  Cant  iv.  4.  (2.)  Or  “ magnificent  ” (Origen),  or  “ magnified,” 
according  to  Pagninus,  because,  says  Origen,  she  followed  Jesus, 
ministered  unto  Him,  and  beheld  the  mystery  of  His  Passion. 
For  the  root  gadal,  means,  “ to  be  great  and  magnificent,”  and

S.  LUKE,  C.  VIII. 


the  Magdalene  was  greatly  exalted  by  Christ  (3.)  Pagninus  says 
that  Magdalene  means,  “remarkable  for  the  standard,”  “bearing  or 
raising  the  standard,”  from  the  root  deghol,  which,  when  the 
letters  ghimel  and  daleth  are  transposed,  signifies  a standard.  For 
the  Magdalene  raised  the  standard  of  penitence  and  love,  and  of 
the  contemplative  life.  Like  as  we  read,  “ His  banner  over  me  was 
love,”  Cant  ii.  4.  (4).  Or  otherwise,  as  the  same  writer  remarks, 
the  name  means,  “ brought  up,  nourished,”  i.e.  led  by  the  teaching 
of  Christ  to  a holy  and  a virtuous  life.  For  the  Hebrew  br)2  gadal 
means  the  same  thing  as  to  nourish  and  bring  up. 

Out  of  whom  went  seven  devils , i.e.  seven  capital  sins,  pride, 
avarice,  gluttony,  luxury,  anger,  envy,  and  careless  living.  Bede, 
Theophylact  and  S.  Gregory.  For  in  a literal  sense  we  are  to  under- 
stand that  she  had.  been  possessed  by  devils  or  evil  spirits,  as  I have 
before  said,  and  that  they  had  gone  out  of  her,  or  (S.  Mark  xvi.  9)  been

We  may  conclude,  therefore,  that  the  Magdalene,  because  of  her 
wickedness  and  sins,  had  been  possessed  by  seven  devils,  and  that 
with  other  demoniacs  she  had  been  made  whole  by  Christ ; that  on 
her  repentance  she  had  obtained  pardon  and  forgiveness,  and,  no 
longer  under  the  power  of  Satan,  but  filled  with  the  spirit  of  God, 
she  devoted  her  whole  after  life  to  the  service  of  Christ  John  of 
Rochester  and  others. 

Seven  devils , either  seven  in  actual  number,  or  “seven”  in  the 
sense  of  many,  or  all ; for,  as  I have  often  pointed  out,  “ seven  ” is 
the  sign  of  multitude  or  totality. 

Ver.  3. — And  Joanna,  the  wife  of  Chuza , Herod s steward  (manager 
or  treasurer,  according  to  the  Arabic  version)  and  Susanna , and 
many  others  which  ministered  unto  Him  of  their  substance.  For  they 
were  rich,  and  grateful  to  their  deliverer,  and  therefore  sought  to 
further  His  preaching,  and  to  spread  the  faith. 

So  SS.  Plautilla,  Priscilla,  and  many  other  rich  and  noble  matrons 
ministered  unto  SS.  Peter,  Paul,  Clement,  and  other  Roman 
Pontiffs,  and  other  orders  of  the  clergy.

become  His  disciple.  Her  name  in  the  Hebrew  signifies  M a lily.” 
On  account  of  the  sweet  radiance  of  a heavenly  life  (Interlinear 
Gloss),  and  the  golden  fervour  of  her  inward  affection.  Bede. 

Ver.  15. — Which  in  an  honest  and  good  heart , having  heard  the 
wordy  keep  it.  The  Council  of  Basle  observes  that  for  the  right 
hearing  of  the  word  of  God  there  is  required, 

1.  A place  fitted  to  receive  it,  ue.  an  honest  and  good  heart 

2.  A proper  disposition,  to  “ keep  ” the  word  when  heard ; and 

3.  That  best  return,  fruit  brought  forth  with  patience. 

A heart  is  honest  and  good,  says  Lyranus,  because  of  the  faith 
which  illumines  it,  and  good  (optimum)  in  a higher  sense  because 
of  grace  working  in  it ; or,  as  others  hold,  it  is  “ bonum  ” because 
disciplined  and  exercised  in  virtue,  and  “ optimum”  because  of 
inward  peace  and  consolation.  Again,  it  is  “ bonum  ” because  puri- 
fied from  sin,  and  “ optimum”  because  conformed  to  the  will  of 
God  (Albertus  Magnus) ; or  " bonum  ” in  discerning  the  truth,  and 
“ optimum  ” in  its  desire  of  that  which  is  right  (Bonaventura)  ; or, 
according  to  S.  Augustin  on  Ps.  vii.,  " bonum  ” on  account  of  the 
love  it  bears  its  neighbour  and  itself,  " optimum  ” on  account  of  its 
exceeding  love  for  God. 

Hence  we  may  take  the  Greek,  xaX/f  xai  d yaQjiy  to  mean  the  same 
as  the  Vulgate  M bono  et  optimo,”  for  the  copula  xa/,  or  “ et,”  signifies 
gradation  and  increase.  They,  therefore,  who  keep  the  word  of 
God  in  an  honest  and  good  heart  bring  forth  fruit  in  proportion : 
good  fruit  if  the  heart  is  good,  better  if  the  heart  is  better,  and  the 
best  fruit  if  the  heart  is  perfect,  i.e.  thirty  fold,  sixty  fold,  or  one 
hundred  fold.  S.  Matt  xiil  8.  And  it  does  not  follow  of  neces- 
sity, as  Toletus  holds,  that  these  words  apply  to  different  persons, 
for  the  heart  of  a believer  may  grow  in  grace,  until  at  last  it  is 
“ optimum,”  perfect  in  sight  of  God. 

With  patience^  ir  tnrofiofjif  i.e.  in  the  endurance  of  labour,  dis-

Ver.  26. — And  they  arrived  at  (sailed  over  to)  the  country  oj  the 
GadareneSy  which  is  over  against  Galilee .

Gadarenes . Gergesenes  (S.  Matt.),  or  as  it  is  written  in  some 
MSS.,  Gerasenes.  Some  think  that  one  and  the  same  place  is  here 
signified,  but  Adricomius  shows  that  Gadara,  and  Gerasa  or  Ger- 
gesa  were  two  distinct  cities,  but  that  the  surrounding  country  was 
named  indifferently  after  either. 

The  Vulgate  translates  “ the  country  of  the  Gerasenes,”  because 
this  was  the  best  known  name. 

Ver.  27. — And  when  he  went  forth  to  land \ there  met  him  out  oj 
the  city  a certain  man,  which  had  devils  long  time,  and  ware  no  clothes , 
neither  abode  in  any  house , but  in  the  tombs. 

“ A man.n  S.  Matt  says  there  were  two.  But  as  this  one  was 
the  fiercer,  and  possessed  by  a legion,  S.  Luke  and  S.  Mark 
mention  him  alone. 

But  in  the  tombs . 1.  The  Jews,  as  I have  before  said,  had  their 

burial  places  without  their  cities.  Their  tombs  were  large  and  lofty 
chambers  as  it  were,  so  as  to  afford  burial  to  many,  and  to  be  easy 
of  access  to  the  friends  and  relatives  of  the  departed.  This  is  clear 
from  what  we  read  of  the  sepulture  of  Christ,  of  Abraham,  Sarah, 
and  others. 

This  demoniac  then  was  driven  by  the  devils  which  possessed 
him  to  dwell  among  the  tombs.  For  these  reasons : 

1.  In  order  to  excite  him  to  greater  ferocity,  and  that  he  might 
be  the  cause  of  greater  fear  to  the  passers-by. 

Probably  he  was  like  what  the  French  fable  to  be  a " loup-garou,” 
i.e.  a man  who  after  the  manner  of  a wolf  sallies  forth  by  night  and 
preys  upon  men  and  animals,  while  by  day  he  hides  himself  in 
tombs  and  by  hollows  of  the  rocks.  “ So  that  no  man  might  pass  by 
that  way”  (S.  Matt  viii.  28),  because  passers-by  were  attacked  and 
wounded  by  him.  The  evil  spirits  were  mostly  wont  to  attack  those 
of  a melancholy  disposition  of  mind,  as  the  more  easily  driven  into 
the  madness  of  despair. 

2.  Because  unclean  spirits  love  to  dwell  in  unclean  places. 
Hence  witches  hold  their  sabbaths  underneath  the  gallows. 

3.  Because  the  devfls  rejoice  at  the  death  of  men,  and  triumph 
over  the  souls  of  them  who  are  condemned  to  helL

THE  LEGION  OF  DEVILS  CAST  OUT. 


223 


4.  S.  Chrysostom,  Euthymius,  and  Theophylact  add  that  he 
dwelt  amongst  the  tombs,  to  persuade  men  that  the  souls  of  the 
dead  are  changed  into  devils,  who  abide  in  the  sepulchres  wherein 
their  bodies  are  buried  Hence  demoniacs  from  time  to  time  have 
cried  out,  I am  the  soul  of  Peter,  or  of  Paul,  or  of  John. 

Ver.  28. — When  he  saw  Jesus , he  cried  out , and  fell  down  before 
Him,  S.  Mark  (chap.  v.  6),  adds,  “ And  when  he  saw  Jesus  afar  of£  he 
ran  and  worshipped  him,"  ue.  bent  the  knee  before  Him.  Because 
he  felt  the  power  of  Christ’s  presence,  and  was  therefore  compelled 
to  draw  nigh  and  worship  Him,  for  fear  lest,  if  he  acknowledged  not 
the  Lord,  he  might  receive  greater  punishment ; and  again,  Christ 
caused  him  to  act  thus  in  order  that  an  opportunity  might  be 
afforded  for  his  cure. 

Son  of  God  most  high.  It  would  seem  that  the  devil,  who  in  the 
temptation  had  not  recognised  Christ,  now  after  so  many  miracles 
acknowledged  Him  to  be  the  Messiah,  the  Son  of  God;  yet, 
blinded  by  pride  and  hatred,  he  hesitated  to  believe  that  the  Son  of 
God  had  stooped  to  take  upon  Him  our  flesh,  and  thought  it 
impossible  that  by  His  death  upon  the  Cross  the  whole  human 
race  could  be  redeemed,  because,  as  Aquinas  remarks,  in  many  ways 
God  had  hindered  him  from  recognising  the  truth.  See  S.  Mark 
iv.  12. 

Torment  me  not.  Do  not  cast  me  out  and  bind  me  for  ever  in 
hell.  See  S.  Matt  viii.  31. 

Ver.  29. — For  He  had  commanded  the  unclean  spirit  to  come  out  of 
the  man.  From  this  and  similar  passages  it  is  clear  that  the  devils 
are  permitted  by  God  to  dwell  on  earth  and  tempt  mankind. 

Hence  it  is  the  custom  of  the  Church  to  bury  the  bodies  of  the 
faithful  in  consecrated  ground  in  order  that  they  may  rest  therein 
free  from  the  assaults  of  evil  spirits,  and  may  profit  by  the  prayers 
of  the  living. 

Ver.  30. — And  Jesus  asked  him , ix,  one  of  the  devils,  sayings 
What  is  thy  name  ? For  Christ  willed  that  the  evil  spirit  should 
declare  his  name,  that  from  it  the  number  of  the  devils,  and  thence 
the  mightiness  of  the  power  which  expelled  them,  might  be  known.

S.  LUKE,  C.  VIII. 


And  he  said , Legion.  A legion  was  composed  of  6000  men,  and 
S.  Ambrose  thinks  that  this  was  the  exact  number  of  the  devils; 
others,  following  the  Scripture,  take  the  word  generally  as  meaning 
“many,”  “because  many  devils  were  entered  into  him.” 

S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa  adds,  “ The  devils,  imitating  the  angelic  host, 
call  themselves  Legion ; nay  more,  they  would  liken  themselves  to 
God  Himself,  who  is  called  the  Lord  God  of  Sabaoth,  i.e.  the  Lord 
of  Hosts.  For  Satan  is  the  counterfeit  and  mockery  of  God.” 

Learn  then  how  great  must  be  the  number  and  the  malignity  of 
the  devils,  that  so  many  should  possess  one  man.  So  we  read  in 
the  life  of  S.  Dominic,  that  very  many  devils  were  cast  out  of  a 
man  by  his  prayers  and  entreaties. 

Therefore,  since  we  are  surrounded  on  all  sides  by  so  many 
spiritual  foes,  we  must  give  ourselves  continually  to  watching  and 
prayer,  in  order  to  obtain  the  victory  over  them,  as  Antony,  who 
was  wont  to  say  that  all  temptations  could  be  overcome  by  the 
Cross  of  Christ,  by  calling  on  Him,  and  by  praying  in  the  spirit 
Wherefore  if  any  one  determines  to  serve  God  perfectly,  let  him 
be  well  assured  that  he  has  arrayed  against  him,  not  one  legion  of 
devils  only,  but  many,  even  Satan  himself  and  all  the  dwellers  in 
helL  Hence  the  Apostle  (Eph.  vi.  12),  “We  wrestle  not  against 
flesh  and  blood,  but  against  principalities,  against  powers,  against  the 
rulers  of  the  darkness  of  this  world,  against  spiritual  wickedness  in 
high  places.” 

Following  the  example  of  Christ,  S.  Hilarion  is  said  to  have 
healed  a demoniac  possessed  by  Legion.  It  is  said  that  after  he 
prayed  to  the  Lord  that  He  would  release  the  afflicted  man  from  his 
misery,  there  were  heard  various  voices  proceeding  from  the 
mouth  of  the  demoniac,  and  as  it  were  the  clamour  of  much 
people.  And  straightway  the  demoniac  was  healed,  and  presented 
himself  not  long  after  with  his  wife  and  children  at  the  monastery, 
bearing  gifts  in  gratitude  for  his  cure. 

Ver.  31. — And  they  besought  Him  that  He  would  not  command  them 
to  go  out  into  the  deep.  For  although  the  devils,  whilst  they  go  to 
and  fro  on  earth,  are  consumed  by  the  fires  of  hell,  yet  it  is  some

gratification,  to  them  that  they  are  not  shut  up  in  prison,  but  are 
permitted  to  tempt  men  to  sin,  and  make  them  sharers  in  their  con- 
demnation. For  they  hate  God  and  envy  men,  because  men  are 
heirs  of  that  kingdom  from  which  they  by  pride  fell  Emmanuel 
Sa  very  appropriately  remarks,  “ God  has  appointed  a punishment 
suited  to  each  sin.  Hell  for  the  lusts  of  the  flesh;  gnashing  of 
teeth  for  ribald  laughter ; thirst  for  self-indulgence  and  gluttony ; the 
worm  for  an  evilly  disposed  heart ; darkness  for  ignorance  and  self- 
deceit  ; the  deep  for  pride,  and  therefore  for  the  devil  and  his  angels. 

Ver.  32. — And  there  was  there  an  herd  of  many  swine  (about  two 
thousand,  S.  Mark  v.  11)  feeding  on  the  mountain  (nigh  unto  the 
mountain,  S.  Mark,  ibid.).  But  for  what  purpose  were  these  swine, 
inasmuch  as  they  were  forbidden  to  the  Jews  by  the  law  of  Moses? 
Gadara,  although  a city  of  Judaea  or  rather  of  Galilee,  had,  accord- 
ing to  Josephus,  been  assigned  by  Caesar  for  a dwelling-place  to  the 
Syrians  and  Gentiles ; who  were  not  prohibited  from  keeping  swine. 
And  again,  the  Jews  might  have  been  feeding  the  swine,  not  for 
their  own  eating,  but  for  other  purposes : to  sell  them  to  the  Gentiles 
for  the  use  of  the  Roman  soldiery,  or  in  order  to  provide  lard  for 
the  greasing  of  their  chariot  wheels. 

And  they  besought  Him  that  He  would  suffer  them  to  enter  into  them. 
The  devils  made  this  request : 

1.  In  order  that,  inasmuch  as  they  were  unable  to  injure  men 
directly,  they  might  injure  them  indirectly  through  their  property  or 
possessions. 

2.  That,  as  actually  came  to  pass,  they  might  stir  up  the  ill-will  of 
the  inhabitants  against  Christ. 

3.  Because  unclean  spirits  delight  in  unclean  things.  Hence  the 
devil  is  said  to  be  worshipped  by  the  witches  in  form  of  a he-goat. 
But  from  this  entreaty  S.  Antony,  according  to  S.  Athanasius,  infers 
the  powerlessness  of  the  devils.  “ For  how,”  he  says,  “ can  they  who 
are  feign  to  seek  permission  to  enter  into  the  herd  of  swine,  have 
any  real  power  over  man,  made  in  the  image  of  God.  Great,  my 
brethren,  are  our  means  of  defence  against  the  hosts  of  Satan : an 

honest  and  pure  life,  and  unfeigned  faith  towards  God.  Believe  me,

Satan  fears  the  prayers  and  fasting,  the  meekness  and  self-denial, 
the  humility  and  contempt  of  vainglory,  the  compassion  and  self- 
command,  and  above  all  the  heart  purified  by  the  love  of  Christ,  of 
those  who  are  living  godly  lives.  For  the  old  serpent,  the  worst 
enemy  of  man,  knows  that  he  lies  under  the  feet  of  the  righteous 
according  to  the  word  of  the  Lord  which  saith,  ‘ Behold,  I give  unto 
yon  power  to  tread  on  serpents  and  scorpions,  and  over  all  the 
power  of  the  enemy.,,,  S.  Luke  x.  19. 

And  He  suffered  them . Christ  granted  the  request  of  the  devils : 
1.  To  show  that  He  had  power  over  the  evil  spirits,  and  that  they 
without  His  leave  could  do  no  evil  to  swine,  much  less  to  men. 
Hence,  as  we  have  seen,  S.  Antony  says  that  they  are  not  to  be 
feared.  2.  To  demonstrate  the  number,  strength  and  malevolence  of 
the  devils,  and  to  make  manifest  by  their  expulsion  the  greatness  of 
His  power  and  glory.  S.  Chrysostom,  Theophylact,  and  Euthy- 
mius.  3.  To  refute  the  error  of  the  Sadducees,  who  say  that  there 
is  “neither  angel  nor  spirit,”  Acts  xxiii.  8.  Hilary.  Rupert  adds, 
That  the  Gadarenes  were  Jews,  who  kept  swine  contrary  to  the 
laws,  and  that  the  destruction  of  the  herd  was  a punishment  for 
their  disobedience ; but  this  interpretation  I have  shown  to  be  wrong. 

Mystically . Christ  did  this  to  show  men,  who,  after  the  manner 
of  swine  wallow  in  fleshly  lusts  and  pleasures,  that  they  in  like 
manner  are  rushing  into  the  abyss  of  hell,  and  also  to  teach  us  that 
we  must  account  the  loss  of  our  earthly  possessions  as  of  small 
account  compared  with  the  destruction  of  the  soul.  For  He  per- 
mitted the  devils  to  enter  into  the  herd  of  swine  in  order  to  free  the 
demoniac  from  their  power;  and  to  show  how  impure  were  the 
minds  of  the  Gadarenes,  and  therefore  how  fitted  they  were  to  be 
possessed  by  devils ; and  yet  further  to  intimate  that  those  who  live 
after  the  manner  of  swine  fall  an  easy  prey  to  the  power  of  Satan. 

^ Ver.  33. — The  herd  ran  violently  down  a steep  place  into  the  lake 
(the  lake  of  Genesareth  or  sea  of  Galilee)  and  were  choked.  S. 
Jerome  writes  that  the  place  where  this  happened  was  well 
known  in  his  day.  The  Syriac  gives  this  rendering,  “ The  whole 
herd  hurried  up  the  mountain,  and  thence  rushed  into  the  sea.”

THE  GADARENES  DISTRUST  JESUS. 


227 


Ver.  34. — When  they  that  fed  them  saw  what  was  done  they  fled 
(lest  they  also  should  perish.  Titus),  and  went  and  told  it  in  the 
city  and  in  the  country . To  the  owners,  in  order  that  they  might 
demand  redress  from  Christ,  who  had  given  the  swine  up  to  the 
power  of  the  devils,  and  not  blame  those  who  were  in  charge  of  the 
herd  for  their  loss. 

Ver.  35. — Then  they  (the  inhabitants  of  the  city  and  country 
round  about)  went  out  to  see  what  was  done ; and  came  to  Jesus . 
They  first  wished  to  ascertain  the  extent  of  their  loss.  Then  they 
“came  to  Jesus,”  to  see  the  author 'of  the  mischief  which  had 
befallen  them,  and  the  man  from  whom  the  devils  had  been  cast 
out  For  their  loss  was  so  great  that  they  were  anxious  to  see 
whether  there  was  any  possibility  of  redress. 

And  found  the  man  out  of  whom  the  devils  were  departed \ sitting  at 
the  feet  of  Jesus , clothed \ and  in  his  right  mind \ It  is  very  probable 
that  the  man,  as  soon  as  the  devils  were  cast  out,  fell  on  his 
knees  at  the  feet  of  Christ  to  give  Him  thanks,  and  that  when 
bidden  to  sit  down,  in  reverent  humility  he  placed  himself  at  Jesus’ 
feet 

And  they  were  afraid  Lest  Christ  should  punish  them  because 
of  their  anger  and  murmurings  against  Him,  aod  perhaps  give  them 
up  to  the  power  of  the  devils. 

Ver.  37. — Then  the  whole  multitude  (the  whole  city,  S.  Matt)  of 
the  country  of  the  Gadarenes  round  about  besought  Him  to  depart  from 
them.  They  did  not  make  their  request  out  of  humility,  because  they 
considered  themselves  unworthy  of  the  presence  of  Christ,  as  S. 
Jerome  thinks,  but  out  of  distrust  and  fear,  lest  His  continuing 
amongst  them  might  cause  them  further  loss.  For  they  knew  that 
Jesus  was  a Jew  by  nation,  a holy  man,  and  possessed  of  divine 
power,  and  that  they  were  Gentiles  of  an  alien  race.  They  there- 
fore feared  lest  He  might  inflict  further  punishment  upon  them 
because  of  their  different  religion  and  their  past  sins.  They  feared 
as  did  the  widow  of  Sarepta,  when  she  exclaimed,  “ What  have  I to 
do  with  thee,  O thou  man  of  God  ? Art  thou  come  unto  me  to 
call  my  sin  to  remembrance,  and  to  slay  my  son  ? ” 1 Kings  xvii.  18.

S.  LUKE,  C.  VIII. 


Therefore  not  from  any  ill-will,  but  rather  from  a reverential  awe, 
they  besought  Jesus  to  depart  out  of  their  coasts.  For  sinners, 
knowing  that  righteousness  and  sin  cannot  exist  together,  fear  the 
presence  of  holy  men,  because  of  the  zeal  with  which  they  seek  the 
correction  of  sinners  and  the  punishment  of  sin. 

And  He  went  up  into  the  ship , and  returned  back  again , from  the 
country  of  the  Gadarenes  to  Capernaum.  S.  Matt  ix.  i.  For  He 
would  not  force  Himself  or  His  ministration  on  those  who  were 
unwilling  to  receive  them. 

Ver.  38. — Now  the  man  out  of  whom  the  devils  were  departed 
besought  him  that  He  might  be  with  Him . In  gratitude  for  the  mercy 
he  had  received,  and  in  hope  of  further  benefits. 

But  Jesus  sent  him  away , saying, 

Ver.  39. — Return  to  thy  own  house,  and  shew  how  great  things 
God  hath  done  unto  thee,  by  means  of  Me,  that  therefore  acknow- 
ledging Me  to  be  the  Messiah,  and  laying  aside  their  bitter  feeling 
because  of  the  loss  of  their  swine,  they  may  believe  and  be  saved. 

And  he  went  his  way,  and  published  throughout  the  whole  city  (in 
Decapolis,  S.  Mark.  v.  20)  how  great  things  Jesus  had  done  unto  him , 
This  city  was  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Gadara,  and  near  it  were  the 
tombs  in  which  the  demoniac  used  to  dwell.  It  is  very  probable 
that,  besides  Jews,  some  of  its  inhabitants  were  Gentiles  and 
unbelievers ; to  them,  therefore,  he  would  tell  of  his  belief  in  Christ, 
in  order  to  lead  them  to  acknowledge  the  Son  of  God.  S.  Ambrose 
and  S.  Chrysostom. 

Mystically . S.  Gregory  explains  (, Moral,  lib.  vi.  cap.  xviL),  that 
“ Christ  here  would  teach  us  to  prefer  the  contemplative  to  the 
active  life.”  For  when  our  thoughts  are  once  awakened  to  divine 
truths,  we  are  unwilling  to  be  taken  up  again  with  earthly  concerns, 
and  refuse  to  be  burdened  with  our  neighbours*  wants  and  neces-

but  that  which  without  labour  refreshes  the  mind.  But  truth  bids 
us  return  home,  and  show  what  great  things  have  been  done  unto 
us  in  order  that  the  mind  may  be  first  exercised  in  working,  and 
then  refreshed  by  contemplation.

CHAPTER  IX. 

I  Christ  sendeth  his  apostles  to  work  miracles , and  to  preach . 7 Herod  desired 
to  see  Christ . 17  Christ  feedeth  five  thousand.  18  Enquire th  what  opinion 

the  world  had  of  him  : foretelleth  his  passion . 23  Proposeth  to  all  the  pattern 

of  his  patience.  28  The  transfiguration.  37  He  healeth  the  lunatic k . 43  Again 
forewarneth  his  disciples  of  his  passion.  46  Commendeth  humility . 51  Biddeth 
them  to  shew  mildness  towards  all \ without  desire  of  revenge . 57  Divers 

would  follow  him,  hut  upon  conditions. 

THEN  he  called  his  twelve  disciples  together,  and  gave  them  power  and 
authority  over  all  devils,  and  to  cure  diseases. 

2  And  he  sent  them  to  preach  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  to  heal  the  sick. 

3  And  he  said  unto  them,  Take  nothing  for  your  journey,  neither  staves,  nor 
scrip,  neither  bread,  neither  money ; neither  have  two  coats  apiece. 

4  And  whatsoever  house  ye  enter  into,  there  abide,  and  thence  depart. 

5  And  whosoever  will  not  receive  you,  when  ye  go  out  of  that  city,  shake  off 
the  very  dust  from  your  feet  for  a testimony  against  them. 

6  And  they  departed,  and  went  through  the  towns,  preaching  the  gospel,  and 
healing  every  where. 

7  Now  Herod  the  tetrarch  heard  of  all  that  was  done  by  him  : and  he  was  per- 
plexed,  because  that  it  was  said  of  some,  that  John  was  risen  from  the  dead  ; 

8  And  of  some,  that  Elias  had  appeared ; and  of  others,  that  one  of  the  old 
prophets  was  risen  again. 

9  And  Herod  said,  John  have  I beheaded : but  who  is  this,  of  whom  I hear 
such  things?  And  he  desired  to  see  him. 

10  And  the  apostles,  when  they  were  returned,  told  him  all  that  they  had  done. 
And  he  took  them,  and  went  aside  privately  into  a desert  place  belonging  to  the 
city  called  Bethsaida. 

1 1  And  the  people,  when  they  knew  it,  followed  him  : and  he  received  them, 
and  spake  unto  them  of  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  healed  them  that  had  need  of 
healing. 

12  And  when  the  day  began  to  wear  away,  then  came  the  twelve,  and  said  unto 
him,  Send  the  multitude  away,  that  they  may  go  into  the  towns  and  country 
round  about,  and  lodge,  and  get  victuals : for  we  are  here  in  a desert  place. 

13  But  he  said  unto  them,  Give  ye  them  to  eat.  And  they  said.  We  have  no 
more  but  five  loaves  and  two  fishes ; except  we  should  go  and  buy  meat  for  all 
this  people. 

14  For  they  were  about  five  thousand  men.  And  he  said  to  his  disciples,  Make 
them  sit  down  by  fifties  in  a company. 

15  And  they  did  so,  and  made  them  all  sit  down.

S.  LUltE,  C.  IX. 


16  Then  he  took  the  five  loaves  and  the  two  fishes,  and  looking  up  to 
heaven,  he  blessed  them,  and  brake,  and  gave  to  the  disciples  to  set  before  the 
multitude. 

17  And  they  did  eat,  and  were  all  filled  : and  there  was  taken  up  of  fragments 
that  remained  to  them  twelve  baskets. 

18  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  was  alone  praying,  his  disciples  were  with  him  : 
and  he  asked  them,  saying,  Whom  say  the  people  that  lam? 

19  They  answering  said,  John  the  Baptist ; but  some  say,  Elias ; and  others 
say,  that  one  of  the  old  prophets  is  risen  again. 

20  He  said  unto  them,  But  whom  say  ye  that  I am  ? Peter  answering  said. 
The  Christ  of  God. 

21  And  he  straitly  charged  them,  and  commanded  them  to  tell  no  man  that 
thing ; 

22  Saying,  The  Son  of  man  must  suffer  many  things,  and  be  rejected  of  the 
elders  and  chief  priests  and  scribes,  and  be  slain,  and  be  raised  the  third  day. 

23  And  he  said  to  them  all,  If  any  man  will  came  after  me,  let  him  deny  him- 
self, and  take  up  his  cross  daily,  and  follow  me. 

24  For  whosoever  will  save  his  life  shall  lose  it : but  whosoever  will  lose  his 
life  for  my  sake,  the  same  shall  save  it 

25  For  what  is  a man  advantaged,  if  he  gain  the  whole  world,  and  lose  himself, 
or  be  cast  away  ? 

26  For  whosoever  shall  be  ashamed  of  me  and  of  my  words,  of  him  shall  the 
Son  of  man  be  ashamed,  when  he  shall  come  in  his  own  glory,  and  in  his  Father's, 
and  of  the  holy  angels. 

27  But  I tell  you  of  a truth,  there  be  some  standing  here,  which  shall  not  taste 
of  death,  till  they  see  the  kingdom  of  God. 

28  And  it  came  to  pass  about  an  eight  days  after  these  sayings,  he  took  Peter 
and  John  and  James,  and  went  up  into  a mountain  to  pray. 

29  And  as  he  prayed,  the  fashion  of  his  countenance  was  altered,  and  his  raiment 
was  white  and  glistering. 

30  And,  behold,  there  talked  with  him  two  men,  which  were  Moses  and 
Elias : 

31  Who  appeared  in  glory,  and  spake  of  his  decease  which  he  should  accom- 
plish at  Jerusalem. 

32  But  Peter  and  they  that  were  with  him  were  heavy  with  sleep : and  when 
they  were  awake,  they  saw  his  glory,  and  the  two  men  that  stood  with  him. 

33  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  they  departed  from  him,  Peter  said  unto  Jesus, 
Master,  it  is  good  for  us  to  be  here : and  let  us  make  three  tabernacles ; one  for 
thee,  and  one  for  Moses,  and  one  for  Elias  : not  knowing  what  he  said. 

34  While  he  thus  spake,  there  came  a cloud,  and  overshadowed  them : and  they 
feared  as  they  entered  into  the  cloud. 

35  And  there  came  a voice  out  of  the  cloud,  saying,  This  is  my  beloved  Son ; 
hear  him. 

36  And  when  the  voice  was  past,  Jesus  was  found  alone.  And  they  kept  it 
close,  and  told  no  man  in  those  days  any  of  those  things  which  they  had  seen. 

37  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  on  the  next  day,  when  they  were  come  down  from 
the  hill,  much  people  met  him. 

38  And,  behold,  a man  of  the  company  cried  out,  saying,  Master,  I beseech 
thee,  look  upon  my  son : for  he  is  mine  only  child.

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  S.  LUKE.  2jt 

39  And,  lo,  a spirit  taketh  him,  and  he  suddenly  crieth  out ; and  it  teareth 
him  that  he  foameth  again,  and  bruising  him  hardly  departeth  from  him. 

40  And  I besought  thy  disciples  to  cast  him  out ; and  they  could  not 

41  And  Jesus  answering  said,  O faithless  and  perverse  generation,  how  long 
shall  I be  with  you,  and  suffer  you  ? Bring  thy  son  hither. 

42  And  as  he  was  yet  a coming,  the  devil  threw  him  down,  and  tare  him,  And 
Jesus  rebuked  the  unclean  spirit,  and  healed  the  child,  and  delivered  him  again 
to  his  father. 

43  And  they  were  all  amazed  at  the  mighty  power  of  God.  But  while  they 
wondered  every  one  at  all  things  which  Jesus  did,  he  said  unto  his  disciples, 

44  Let  these  sayings  sink  down  into  your  ears : for  the  Son  of  man  shall  be 
delivered  into  the  hands  of  men. 

45  But  they  understood  not  this  saying,  and  it  was  hid  from  them,  that  they 
perceived  it  not : and  they  feared  to  ask  him  of  that  saying. 

46  Then  there  arose  a reasoning  among  them,  which  of  them  should  be  greatest. 

47  And  Jesus,  perceiving  the  thought  of  their  heart,  took  a child,  and  set  him 
by  him. 

48  And  said  unto  them,  Whosoever  shall  receive  this  child  in  my  name  receiveth 
me : and  whosoever  shall  receive  me  receiveth  him  that  sent  me : for  he  that  is 
least  among  you  all,  the  same  shall  be  great. 

49  And  John  answered  and  said.  Master,  we  saw  one  casting  out  devils  in  thy 
name ; and  we  forbad  him,  because  he  followeth  not  with  us. 

50  And  Jesus  said  unto  him.  Forbid  him  not : for  he  that  is  not  against  us  is 
for  us. 

51  And  it  came  to  pass,  when  the  time  was  come  that  he  should  be  received 
up,  he  stedfastly  set  his  face  to  go  to  Jerusalem, 

52  And  sent  messengers  before  his  face : and  they  went,  and  entered  into  a 
village  of  the  Samaritans,  to  make  ready  for  him. 

53  And  they  did  not  receive  him,  because  his  face  was  as  though  he  would  go  to 
Jerusalem. 

54  And  when  his  disciples  James  and  John  saw  this,  they  said,  Lord,  wilt  thou 
that  we  command  fire  to  come  down  from  heaven,  and  consume  them,  even  as 
Elias  did  ? 

55  But  he  turned,  and  rebuked  them,  and  said,  Ye  know  not  what  manner  of 
spirit  ye  are  of. 

56  For  the  Son  of  man  is  not  come  to  destroy  men's  lives,  but  to  save  them. 
And  they  went  to  another  village. 

57  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  they  went  in  the  way,  a certain  man  said  unto 
him.  Lord,  I will  follow  thee  whithersoever  thou  goest. 

58  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Foxes  have  holes,  and  birds  of  the  air  have  nests ; 
but  the  Son  of  man  hath  not  where  to  lay  his  head. 

59  And  he  said  unto  another,  Follow  me.  But  he  said,  Lord,  suffer  me  first 
to  go  and  bury  my  father. 

60  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Let  the  dead  bury  their  dead  : but  go  thou  and  preach 
the  kingdom  of  God. 

61  And  another  also  said,  Lord,  I will  follow  thee ; but  let  me  first  go  bid 
them  farewell,  which  are  at  home  at  my  house. 

62  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  No  man  having  put  his  hand  to  the  plough,  and 
looking  back,  is  fit  for  the  kingdom  of  God.

Ver  8. — One  of  the  old  prophets  was  risen  again.  As  Enoch  and 
Elias  will  rise  again  before  the  end  of  all  things,  to  resist  Antichrist 
In  like  manner  as  Peter,  Bishop  and  Martyr,  the  son  of  Urijah 
the  prophet  (Jer.  xxvi.  20),  was  recalled  to  life  by  & James  the 
Apostle,  and  ordained  first  Bishop  of  Braga,  six  hundred  years  after 
his  decease.  S.  Athanasius  and  others,  cited  by  Bivarius. 

Ver.  14. — Make  them  sit  down  by  fifties  in  a company , xX/f/ac,  i.e 
in  companies,  in  ranks  or  rows.  Syriac. 

Ver.  26. — For  whosoever  shall  be  ashamed  of  Me  and  of  My  words, 
of  him  shall  the  Son  of  man  be  ashamed,  when  He  shall  come  in  His 
own  glory , and  in  His  Father’s , and  of  the  holy  angels , i.e.  at  the  day 
of  judgment,  when  He  shall  sit  as  judge  in  the  valley  of  Jehoshaphat, 
and  in  the  presence  of  all,  both  men  and  angels,  reward  the  just, 
and  punish  the  evildoers. 

Whosoever  shall  be  ashamed  of  Me.  Whosoever,  from  false  shame 
or  from  fear  of  others,  shall  deny  his  faith  in  Me  or  refuse  to  obey 
My  commandments,  or  fear  the  reproach  of  the  Cross  and  a 
crucified  Saviour,  of  him  shall  the  Son  of  man  be  ashamed,  Le.  him 
will  Christ  pass  over,  and  make  of  no  account  when  He  comes  in 
that  glory  which  He  has  acquired  by  the  humiliation  of  His  passion. 
For  the  Cross  of  Christ  seemed  to  many  a shame  and  a reproach, 
for  Christ  crucified  was  “unto  the  Jews  a stumbling  block,  and  unto 
the  Greeks  foolishness,”  1 Cor.  L 23.  Many,  therefore,  from  shame 
or  fear,  did  not  dare  to  profess  their  belief  in  the  Cross,  much  less 
to  preach  Christ  crucified.  In  opposition  to  whom  S.  Paul  boldly 
declares,  “ I am  not  ashamed  of  the  Gospel  of  Christ,  for  it  is  the 
power  of  God  unto  salvation  to  every  one  that  believeth,  to  the  Jew 
first,  and  also  to  the  Greek,”  Rom.  i.  16. 

So  the  monk  Martyrius  took  Christ,  who  appeared  to  Him  as  a 
wearied  leper,  upon  his  shoulders,  and  carried  Him  to  the  monas- 
tery, but  felt  not  the  weight  of  his  burden,  for  the  burden  he  was 
carrying  supported  him.  There  Christ  assumed  His  own  proper 
form,  and  ascending  to  heaven  said,  “ As  thou,  Martyrius,  wast  not 
ashamed  of  Me  on  earth,  I will  not  be  ashamed  of  thee  in  heaven.” 

S.  Gregory  (horn.  39),  also,  explaining  this  passage  of  & Luke,

THE  TRANSFIGURATION.

writes,  “ Each  one  should  ask  himself,  in  order  to  test  the  reality  of 
his  confession  of  Christ,  not  whether  he  is  ashamed  of  the  name  of 
the  Redeemer,  but  rather  whether  by  strength  of  purpose  he  has 
subdued  all  false  feelings  of  earthly  shame.  In  time  of  persecution 
believers  might  have  had  cause  for  shame  at  the  treatment  to  which 
they  were  subjected ; but  now  that  persecutions  are  past,  there  is 
another  aspect  of  the  matter  to  which  we  should  give  heed.  We 
shrink  often  from  being  lightly  esteemed,  and  from  being  evilly 
spoken  of  by  our  fellow  men,  and  in  case  of  a dispute  with  our 
neighbour,  we  are  ashamed  to  be  the  first  to  make  amends.  Because 
the  carnal  heart,  seeking  this  world’s  glory,  refuses  the  grace  of 
humility and  further  on  he  gives  the  remedy  for  this  false  shame. 
“ Let  human  pride  be  confounded,  and  let  evtfry  man  be  ashamed, 
if  he  be  not  the  first  to  seek  to  make  amends  to  his  neighbour ; since, 
after  we  have  done  amiss,  God  by  His  ministers  beseeches  us  to  be 
reconciled  to  Him,  whom  we  have  offended.” 

Ver.  29. — Glistering,  i^aer^dvruv,  i.e.  like  lightning  glittering  and 
emitting  flashes  of  light,  for  the  raiment  of  Christ  shone  from  the 
glory  of  His  altered  countenance. 

Ver.  31.  And  spake  of  his  decease , t£odor,  departure,  i.e.  death. 

1.  They  spake  of  His  death,  that  He  should  die  upon  the  Cross. 

2.  But  the  words  may  signify  the  victory  which  Christ  was  to  win 
over  death  and  sin  and  Satan.  Allusion  is  made  to  the  deliverance, 
the  exodus  of  Israel  from  Egypt,  and  the  destruction  of  Pharaoh 
and  his  host  in  the  Red  Sea,  which  is  a type  of  the  deliverance 
effected  by  Christ  for  His  people.  Cyril  thinks  that  by  exodus  we 
must  understand  “ His  passion  ” and  the  Arabic  version  interprets 
the  word  by  “ eventum,”  “ outcome : ” . “ They  spake  of  the  outcome 
and  the  events  connected  with  the  sufferings  and  triumph  which  He 
was  about  to  accomplish  at  Jerusalem.” 

3.  Some  take  the  word  to  mean  the  excess  of  love  and  all  virtues. 
For  on  the  Cross  was  exhibited  the  excess  and  perfection  of  love, 
obedience,  humility,  patience,  and  every  Christian  virtue,  inasmuch 
as  Christ  by  the  offering  of  Himself  far  exceeded  the  utmost  limits 
of  human  virtue.  This  “ excessus  ” then  was  an  ecstasy  of  love,

wherein  Christ  went  as  it  were  out  of  Himself  to  show  the 
immensity  of  His  love  for  God  and  men. 

Ver.  32. — But  Peter  and  they  that  were  with  Him  were  heavy  with 
sleep.  S.  Chrysostom  takes  sleep  to  mean  amazement.  But  we  may 
rather  accept  the  words  simply  as  describing  the  natural  sleep 
which  had  fallen  on  the  Apostles  after  the  fatigue  of  their  journey 
and  watchings,  from  which  they  were  awakened  by  the  brightness  of 
the  transfiguration.  See  S.  Matt.  xvii.  1. 

Ver.  49. — And  John  answered  and  said , Master , we  saw  one 
easting  out  devils  in  Thy  name ; and  we  forbad  himy  because  he 
followed  not  with  us , i.e.  because  he  was  not  Thy  disciple.  For  he 
thought  that  only  the  Apostles,  to  whom  that  power  was  given,  were 
permitted  to  do  this.  Cyril  and  S.  Ambrose  remark,  “ He  thinks 
that  he  who  does  not  render  obedience,  should  not  enjoy  the 
benefit  arising  therefrom.”  S.  John  asks  the  question,  because 
from  his  love  he  was  the  more  zealous  for  his  Master’s  honour. 

Ver.  50. — And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Forbid  him  not:  for  he  that  is 
not  against  us  is  for  us.  They  were  taught  that  no  one  was  to  be 
hindered  from  the  exercise  of  such  powers  of  doing  good  as 
he  possessed,  but  rather  to  be  encouraged  to  seek  to  increase  them. 
Gloss.  God  rewards  the  strong,  but  does  not  reject  the  weak. 
S.  Ambrose.  For,  saith  Theophylact,  the  grace  of  God  operates 
even  by  means  of  the  unworthy  who  are  not  disciples  of  Christ : 
like  as  men  are  made  holy  by  priests  who  are  not  holy  themselves. 
Hence  Bede  remarks,  In  the  case  of  heretics,  it  is  not  their  sacra- 
ments, which  they  hold  in  common  with  us,  but  their  divisions,  so 
contrary  to  the  truth  and  peace,  which  we  ought  to  detest  and  strive 
to  amend.  See  S.  Mark  ix.  37. 

Ver.  51. — And  it  came  to  pass  when  the  time  was  come  (i.e. 
was  drawing  nigh)  that  He  should  be  received  up.  The  time  when, 
after  having  fulfilled  His  earthly  ministry,  He  was  to  return 
again  to  the  Father.  The  day  foreordained  of  God  when  He 
was  to  be  taken  up  into  heaven.  Euthymius.  Up  to  this 
time  Christ  had,  for  two  years  and  a half,  been  preaching  the 
Gospel  everywhere,  but  chiefly  in  the  towns  and  villages  of  Galilee.

The  stedfasT  resolution  of  jesus. 


*35 


There  yet  remained  to  Him  six  months  of  life.  He  therefore  now 
set  forth  to  preach  more  particularly  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  holy 
city  and  Judaea,  in  order  to  prepare  for  His  passion  in  Jerusalem 
and  resurrection  from  the  dead.  S.  Luke  therefore  implies  that 
hitherto  he  had  written  of  those  things  which  Christ  had  done  in 
Galilee,  but  was  henceforward  about  to  tell  of  what  was  done  in 
Judaea. 

He  stedfastly  set  His  face  to  go  to  Jerusalem . With  a firm  and 
undismayed  mind.  Bede.  Christ  turned  not  aside,  as  timid  and 
hesitating  people  are  wont  to  do,  but  went  direct  to  Jerusalem, 
eager  for  the  dread  encounter.  Titus,  Theophylact,  and  others. 

For,”  says  Jerome,  “He  who  of  His  own  will  was  hastening 
to  His  passion,  needed  both  fortitude  and  firmness.” 

Thus  it  behoves  us  also  to  nerve  our  hearts,  after  the  example  of 
the  martyrs,  to  endure  hardship,  like  the  lions  described  by  Pliny, 
who  tells  us  that,  “when  a lioness  fights  for  her  young,  she  keeps 
her  eyes  fixed  on  the  ground,  that  she  may  not  be  terrified  by  the 
sight  of  the  hunters.” 

S.  Mark  adds,  x.  32,  “and  Jesus  went  before  them:  and  they 
were  amazed ; ” because  they  saw  Him  cheerfully  and  with  a good 
courage  going  up  to  suffer  and  to  die,  and  “as  they  followed,  they 
were  afraid  ” lest  they  might  be  called  upon  to  die  with  Him. 

It  seems  clear,  as  I have  said  in  my  chronological  table,  that  this 
journey  of  Christ  from  Galilee  to  Judaea,  is  the  same  as  that  men- 
tioned by  S.  Matt.  xix.  1 ; by  S.  Mark  x.  32;  and  S.  John  vil 
2 and  14. 

From  the  latter  Evangelist  it  is  apparent  that  the  journey  was 
undertaken  at  the  time  of  the  feast  of  tabernacles,  which  falls  in  the 
September  of  our  year,  and  since  Christ  suffered  in  the  following 
March,  it  follows  that  the  events  here  recorded  happened  about 
six  months  before  the  crucifixion.  It  is  also  evident,  from  what  is 
recorded  by  S.  Luke  in  the  subsequent  chapters,  that  during  this 
period  Christ  often  went  to  Jerusalem,  and  returned  thence  through 
Judaea,  preaching  and  working  miracles,  as  He  had  before  done  in 
Galilee ; but  we  must  bear  in  mind  that  S.  Luke  at  times  interrupts

his  narrative  to  recapitulate  certain  things  which  had  happened 
before  our  Lord  had  come  to  Judaea.  Jansenius,  Francis  Lucas, 
and  others. 

On  the  other  hand,  Maldonatus  places  this  journey  a year  before 
the  death  of  our  Lord,  and  is  of  opinion  that  Christ  returned  again 
to  Galilee,  and  only  went  up  to  Jerusalem  to  suffer  and  to  die. 
But  this  explanation  does  not  agree  with  the  words  of  the  fifty-first 
verse,  " when  the  time  was  come  that  He  should  be  received  up  ” — 
words  which  would  not  have  been  written  if  the  time  had  been  a 
year  distant. 

Ver.  52. — And  sent  messengers  before  His  face:  and  they  went , and 
entered  into  a village  oj  the  Samaritans , to  make  ready  for  Him , to 
prepare  food  and  lodging  for  Him  and  His  companions,  the  twelve 
Apostles  and  the  holy  women  who  had  followed  Him  out  of  Galilee. 
See  chap.  viii.  2,  xxiil  49. 

Christ  sent  them  in  order  that  they  might  become  accustomed  to 
act  independently  of  Him,  and  to  be  despised  of  men.  Theophy- 
lact,  Euthymius,  and  Maldonatus  are  of  opinion  that  these  messen- 
gers were  James  and  John.  Maldonatus  also  thinks  that  by  the 
Greek  xwpiir,  we  are  to  understand  city,  possibly  Samaria  itself ; but 
other  commentators  agree  that  the  disciples  were  sent  to  some 
small  town  or  village  of  the  Samaritans  which  lay  on  the  road 
to  Jerusalem. 

Ver.  53. — And  they  (the  Samaritans)  did  not  receive  Him , because 
His  face  was  as  though  He  would  go  to  Jerusalem . Because  He 
appeared  to  be  going  up  to  Jerusalem  (Syriac),  for  it  was  plain,  from 
the  bearing  of  Jesus  and  His  messengers,  that  they  were  on  their 
way  to  keep  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles,  S.  John  vii.  2.  The 
Samaritans,  contrary  to  the  Law,  had  erected  a temple  on  Mount 
Gerizim  for  the  worship  of  God,  and  therefore  there  was  on  this 
account  a constant  enmity  between  the  Jews  and  them.  S.  John 
iv.  20,  and  Josephus.  Hence  they  rejected  Jesus,  as  despising 
their  form  of  worship  and  favouring  that  of  their  enemies,  the  Jews. 

“ His  face  was  as  though,”  a Hebraism  for  D\D3,  i.e.  rtfetwot,  or 
face,  is  often  used  for  the  person  himself.

THE  VENGEFUL  REQUEST  OF  JAMES  AND  JOHN.  237 


Ver.  54. — And  when  His  disciples  James  and  John  saw  this,  they 
said,  Lord,  wilt  Thou  that  we  command  fire  to  come  down  from 
heaven,  and  consume  them,  even  as  Elias  didf  They  show  them- 
selves to  be  indeed  Boanerges,  or  sons  of  thunder,  for  with  excess 
of  zeal  they  would  destroy  these  Samaritans,  because  of  their  inhos- 
pitality and  refusal  to  receive  Christ  They  remembered  how 
Elijah  had  destroyed  those  who  had  been  sent  by  Ahaziah  to 
apprehend  him  (2  Kings  i.  io),  and  they  knew  that  Jesus  was 
mightier  than  that  prophet ; and  if  fire  was  sent  from  heaven  to 
protect  Elijah  from  harm,  and  to  consume  the  Jews,  who  had  come 
to  take  him,  how  much  more  deserving  of  punishment  were  these 
Samaritans,  who  had  refused  to  receive  the  Son  of  God. 

Wilt  Thou  that  we  command  f For  as  S.  Jerome  goes  on  to 
say  ( Epist '.  15 1),  “The  command  of  the  Apostles  can  effect  nothing, 
unless  by  the  permission  and  will  of  God.”  They  therefore  seek 
from  Christ,  as  from  a judge,  justice,  and  the  punishment  of  the 
wicked,  according  to  their  deserts. 

Ver.  55. — But  He  turned,  and  rebuked  them,  and  said,  Ye  know  not 
what  manner  of  spirit  ye  are  of  By  spirit  we  must  understand 
“disposition  of  mind,”  whether  for  virtue  or  vice.  Ye  know  not 
what  spirit  worketh  in  you.  Ye  think  ye  are  led  by  the  spirit  of  God, 
when  ye  are  prompted  by  impatience  and  the  spirit  of  vengeance. 
Ye  know  not  to  what  spirit  ye  are  called.  Ye  know  not  that  ye 
should  be  meek  and  lowly,  as  I your  Lord  and  Master  am.  Ye 
would  imitate  the  zeal  of  Elijah,  and  demand  “ an  eye  for  an  eye, 
a tooth  for  a tooth,”  Exod.  xxi.  24.  But  this  is  not  my  spirit,  nor  is 
it  the  teaching  of  the  new  and  Gospel  Law,  for  I say  unto  you 
“Love  your  enemies,  and  do  good  unto  those  that  hate  you.” 
S.  Matt  v.  44.  Have  ye  not  heard  and  learned  this  from  Me,  or 
are  ye  so  soon  forgetful  of  my  doctrine  and  teaching  ? He  who  had 
come,  not  for  judgment  but  to  show  mercy,  not  in  power  but  in 
humility,  not  in  the  glory  of  His  Father  but  in  lowly  fashion  as  a 
man,  rebuked  them  because  they  were  forgetful  both  of  His  teaching 
and  of  the  merciful  precepts  of  His  GospeL  S.  Jerome. 

Ver.  56. — For  the  Son  of  man  is  not  come  to  destroy  men's  lives,  but

to  save  them.  Act,  therefore,  saith  Bede,  according  to  the  spirit 
ye  are  of.  Following  the  example  of  Christ,  bear  patiently  as 
becometh  saints.  Titus. 

And  they  went  to  another  village^  where  they  might  meet  with  a 
better  reception.  By  this  He  teaches  His  Apostles  that  hereafter, 
when  they  went  throughout  the  world  to  preach  the  Gospel,  if  they 
were  cast  out  of  one  city,  they  were  patiently  to  go  on  to  another. 
Hence  He  allowed  Himself  to  be  rejected  by  the  Samaritans,  that  by 
His  rebuke  of  James  and  John,  He  might  teach  the  Apostles  a life- 
long lesson.  For,  as  saith  S.  Ambrose,  mercy  promoteth  in  thee 
patience,  in  the  offender  correction.  Thus  we  find  that  these  Samari- 
tans who  were  spared  punishment  the  sooner  became  believers. 
S.  John  iv. ; Acts  viii. 

Perfect  virtue  desireth  not  vengeance,  nor  can  anger  exist 
where  love  aboundeth.  The  infirmities  of  our  fellow  men  are  to 
be  borne  with  and  remedied,  not  to  be  rejected  as  incapable  of 
cure.  Titus. 

Ver.  6 1. — And  another  also  said \ Lord \ I will  follow  thee;  but  let 
me  first  go  bid  them  farewell , which  are  at  home  at  my  house.  This 
verse  has  been  variously  explained. 

1.  Suffer  me  to  give  notice  to  my  parents  and  to  consult  with 
them ; for  he  was  doubtful  what  he  should  do.  But  Christ  would 
not  grant  his  request,  because  parents  very  often  do  not  approve  of 
the  higher  life,  and  sometimes  dissuade  their  children  from  adopting 
it.  Titus. 

2.  Suffer  me  to  tell  my  parents  of  my  intention,  that  knowing 
what  is  become  of  me,  they  may  neither  be  anxious  about  me,  nor 
come  to  seek  me.  S.  Augustin  (serm.  vii.  De  verbis  Domini)  and 
Toletus. 

3.  S.  Basil  ( Constit . cap.  xxi.)  thinks  that  the  man,  like  the  one 
who  preceded  him,  was  a disciple,  and  that  he  only  sought  per- 
mission to  say  farewell  to  his  friends,  as  about  to  return  to  them  no 
more.  The  Syriac  favours  this  interpretation,  and  translates,  “ Let 
me  go  to  salute,  ie.  to  bid  farewell  to  my  family  at  home,  and  I will 
ome  again.”

CHRIST  DEPRECATES  “ LOOKING  BACK.” 

4.  The  best  rendering  is  that  of  the  Vulgate,  which  for  “ them  ” 
substitutes  “ those  things.”  Let  me  go  bid  “ those  things”  fare- 
well. Give  me  time  to  dispose  of  my  property  at  home,  and 
divide  it  amongst  my  brethren  and  kinsmen ; for  this  is  the  true 
meaning  of  the  Greek  word  Hence  the  Arabic  has, 

“ Suffer  me  to  make  division  amongst  my  friends  at  home.”  So  also 
S.  Augustin,  Maldonatus,  and  others. 

Ver.  62. — And  Jesus  said  unto  him , No  man , having  put  his  hand 
to  the  plough , and  looking  back,  is  fit  for  the  kingdom  of  God,  or,  to 
carry  on  the  metaphor,  is  fit  to  work  in  the  vineyard  of  God.  For 
as  the  ploughman  who  seeks  to  make  his  furrows  straight  ought  to 
look  forward  and  never  back,  so  he  who  has  determined  to  conse- 
crate himself  to  God’s  service,  is  unworthy  to  be  Christ’s  disciple 
and  to  be  an  heir  of  the  heavenly  kingdom,  if  he  still  has  regard 
for  the  perishable  possessions  of  this  world  which  he  has  renounced 
and  given  up;  and  so  Euthymius  says,  “He  who  follows  Christ 
ought  forthwith  to  give  up  all  things,  lest  by  averting  his  eyes 
from  his  leader  and  guide,  he  might  again  be  entangled  by  the 
sight  of  those  things  which  he  has  left”  So  also  Titus,  Jansenius, 
Toletus,  and  others. 

Christ  in  this  very  remarkable  verse  points  out  the  way  of 
perfection,  and  endeavours  to  withdraw  the  man  from  his  own 
anxiety  for  his  friends  and  possessions,  in  order  that  he  might  give 
himself  up  wholly  to  God.  Especially  as  there  was  danger  lest, 
delayed  in  the  disposal  of  his  property,  or  impressed  with  the  value 
of  his  possessions,  he  might  change  his  purpose,  and  like  many 
others,  lose  the  hope  of  his  calling.  And  again,  there  was  no  need 
of  his  presence,  for  his  brethren  and  kinsfolk  could  divide  his 
property  without  him. 

Thus  James  and  John,  when  they  were  called,  left  their  father  and 
their  nets,  and  straightway  followed  Christ,  S.  Matt  iv.  20.  But  on  the 
other  hand  Elisha  (1  Kings  xix.  20)  was  permitted  to  bid  farewell  to 
his  father  and  mother,  apparently  because  there  was  in  his  case  little 
danger  of  his  being  forgetful  of  his  call.  Hence  S.  Basil  saith 
( serm . 1 De  Baptism) : He  looks  back  who  delays,  however  briefly,

S.  LUKE,  C.  IX. 


that  obedience  which  is  to  be  rendered  at  once  and  promptly  to  the 
call  of  God. 

Hence  of  the  cherubim  we  read  (Ezek.  i.  12),  “They  went  every 
one  straight  forward  : they  turned  not  when  they  went”  Whereon 
S.  Gregory  says  the  winged  creatures,  i.e.  holy  preacher^,  turn  not 
as  they  go,  because  they  are  passing  through  earthly  things  to 
heavenly ; and  therefore  no  more  return  to  these  things  which  they 
have  left  behind.  For  to  seek  in  heart  and  mind  after  better  things 
is,  as  it  w**e.  to  advance  or  go  along  a certain  road.  Hence  S.  Paul, 
Phil  iii  13,  14:  “Forgetting  those  things  which  are  behind,  and 
reaching  forth  unto  those  things  which  are  before,  I press  toward 
the  mark  for  the  prize  of  the  high  calling  of  God  in  Christ  Jesus.” 
And  to  the  bride  it  is  said,  “Forget  thine  own  people  and  thy 
father’s  house,”  Ps.  xlv.  10. 

Hence  also  S.  Augustin  (semi.  7 De  verbis  Domini)  says,  “ The 
east  calleth  thee,  and  thou  tumest  to  the  west.” 

Figuratively , says  Bede,  he  putteth  his  hand  to  the  plough,  who 
by  the  Cross  of  Christ,  as  if  by  an  instrument  of  remorse,  wears  away 
the  hardness  of  his  heart,  and  opens  it  to  bear  the  fruit  of  good 
works.  But  he  must  not  look  back  like  Lot’s  wife  to  the  things 
which  he  has  left,  and  if  the  follower  of  the  Lord,  who  wishes  to 
bid  farewell  to  them  which  are  at  home,  is  worthy  of  reproach,  what 
will  become  of  them,  who  for  no  sufficient  reason  visit  the  houses 
of  those  whom  they  have  left  in  the  world?  For  the  frequent 
looking  back  on  the  things  which  we  have  forsaken,  by  force  of 
habit  draws  us  again  to  our  past  way  of  life.  For  practice,  by 
which  habits  are  formed,  is  very  powerful  \ and  habits  become  a 
second  nature,  which  it  is  difficult  to  do  away  with  or  change.  For 
it  rapidly  returns  to  itself.

CHAPTER  X. 

I  Christ  sendeth  out  at  once  seventy  disciples  to  work  miracles , and  to  preach.  17 
Admmisheth  them  to  be  humble , and  wherein  to  rejoice.  2 1 Thanketh  his  Father 
for  his  grace . 23  Magnifieth  the  happy  estate  of  his  church.  25  Teacheth  the 

lawyer  how  to  attain  eternal  life%  and  to  take  every  one  for  his  neighbour  that 
needeth  his  mercy . 41  Reprehendeth  Martha , and  commendeth  Mary  her  sister. 

AFTER  these  things  the  Lord  appointed  other  seventy  also,  and  sent  them  two 
and  two  before  his  face  into  every  city  and  place,  whither  he  himself  would 

come. 

2  Therefore  said  he  unto  them,  The  harvest  truly  is  great,  but  the  labourers  are 
few  : pray  ye  therefore  the  Lord  of  the  harvest,  that  he  would  send  forth  labourers 
into  his  harvest 

3  Go  your  ways  : behold,  I send  you  forth  as  lambs  among  wolves. 

4  Carry  neither  purse,  nor  scrip,  nor  shoes : and  salute  no  man  by  the  way. 

5  And  into  whatsoever  house  ye  enter,  first  say,  Peace  be  to  this  house. 

6  And  if  the  son  of  peace  be  there,  your  peace  shall  rest  upon  it 2 if  not,  it  shall 
turn  to  you  again. 

7  And  in  the  same  house  remain,  eating  and  drinking  such  things  as  they  give : 
for  the  labourer  is  worthy  of  his  hire.  Go  not  from  house  to  house. 

8  And  into  whatsoever  city  ye  enter,  and  they  receive  you,  eat  such  things  as 
are  set  before  you : 

9  And  heal  the  sick  that  are  therein,  and  say  unto  them,  The  kingdom  of  God 
is  come  nigh  unto  you. 

10  But  into  whatsoever  city  ye  enter,  and  they  receive  you  not,  go  your  ways 
out  into  the  streets  of  the  same,  and  say, 

11  Even  the  very  dust  of  your  city,  which  cleaveth  on  us,  we  do  wipe  off  against 
you : notwithstanding  be  ye  sure  of  this,  that  the  kingdom  of  God  is  come  nigh 
unto  you. 

12  But  I say  unto  you,  that  it  shall  be  more  tolerable  in  that  day  for  Sodom, 
than  for  that  city. 

13  Woe  unto  thee,  Chorarin  t woe  unto  thee,  Bethsaida  ! for  if  the  mighty  works 
had  been  done  in  Tyre  and  Sidon,  which  have  been  done  in  you,  they  had  a great 
while  ago  repented,  sitting  in  sackcloth  and  ashes. 

14  But  it  shall  be  more  tolerable  for  Tyre  and  Sidon  at  the  judgment,  than 
for  you. 

15  And  thou,  Capernaum,  which  art  exalted  to  heaven,  shall  be  thrust  down  to 
hell. 

16  He  that  heareth  you  heareth  me  ; and  he  that  despiseth  you  despiseth  me ; 
and  he  that  despiseth  me  despiseth  him  that  sent  me.

S.  LUKE,  C.  X 


17  And  the  seventy  returned  again  with  joy,  saying,  Lord,  even  the  devils  are 
subject  unto  us  through  thy  name. 

18  And  he  said  unto  them,  I beheld  Satan  as  lightning  fall  from  heaven. 

19  Behold,  I give  unto  you  power  to  tread  on  serpents  and  scorpions,  and  over 
all  the  power  of  the  enemy  : and  nothing  shall  by  any  means  hurt  you. 

20  Notwithstanding  in  this  rejoice  not,  that  the  spirits  are  subject  unto  you ; 
but  rather  rejoice,  because  your  names  are  written  in  heaven. 

21  In  that  hour  Jesus  rejoiced  in  spirit,  and  said,  I thank  thee,  O Father,  Lord 
of  heaven  and  earth,  that  thou  hast  hid  these  things  from  the  wise  and  prudent, 
and  hast  revealed  them  unto  babes : even  so,  Father ; for  so  it  seemed  good  in 
thy  sight. 

22  All  things  are  delivered  to  me  of  my  Father  : and  no  man  knoweth  who 
the  Son  is,  but  the  Father ; and  who  the  Father  is,  but  the  Son,  and  he  to  whom 
the  Son  will  reveal  him . 

23  And  he  turned  him  unto  his  disciples,  and  said  privately,  Blessed  are  the 
eyes  which  see  the  things  that  ye  see  : 

24  For  I tell  you,  that  many  prophets  and  kings  have  desired  to  see  those  things 
which  ye  see,  and  have  not  seen  them  ; and  to  hear  those  things  which  ye  hear, 
and  have  not  heard  them. 

25  And,  behold,  a certain  lawyer  stood  up,  and  tempted  him,  saying,  Master, 
what  shall  I do  to  inherit  eternal  life? 

26  He  said  unto  him,  What  is  written  in  the  law  ? how  readest  thou  ? 

27  And  he  answering  said,  Thou  shalt  love  the  Lord  thy  God  with  all  thy  heart, 
and  with  all  thy  soul,  and  with  all  thy  strength,  and  with  all  thy  mind  ; and  thy 
neighbour  as  thyself. 

28  And  he  said  unto  him,  Thou  hast  answered  right : this  do,  and  thou  shalt  live. 

29  But  he,  willing  to  justify  himself,  said  unto  Jesus,  And  who  is  my  neighbour? 

30  And  Jesus  answering  said,  A certain  man  went  down  from  Jerusalem  to 
Jericho,  and  fell  among  thieves,  which  stripped  him  of  his  raiment,  and  wounded 
himt  and  departed,  leaving  him  half  dead. 

31  And  by  chance  there  came  down  a certain  priest  that  way  : and  when  he 
saw  him,  he  passed  by  on  the  other  side. 

32  And  likewise  a Levite,  when  he  was  at  the  place,  came  and  looked  on  him , 
and  passed  by  on  the  other  side. 

33  But  a certain  Samaritan,  as  he  journeyed,  came  where  he  was  : and  when  he 
saw  him,  he  had  compassion  on  him , 

34  And  went  to  himt  and  bound  up  his  wounds,  pouring  in  oil  and  wine,  and 
set  him  on  his  own  beast,  and  brought  him  to  an  inn,  and  took  care  of  him. 

35  And  on  the  morrow  when  he  departed,  he  took  out  two  pence,  and  gave 
them  to  the  host,  and  said  unto  him,  Take  care  of  him ; and  whatsoever  thou 
spendest  more,  when  I come  again,  I will  repay  thee. 

36  Which  now  of  these  three,  thinkest  thou,  was  neighbour  unto  him  that  fell 
among  the  thieves? 

37  And  he  said,  He  that  shewed  mercy  on  him.  Then  said  Jesus  unto  him. 
Go,  and  do  thou  likewise. 

38  Now  it  came  to  pass,  as  they  went,  that  he  entered  into  a certain  village : 
and  a certain  woman  named  Martha  received  him  into  her  house. 

39  And  she  had  a sister  called  Mary,  which  also  sat  at  Jesus’  feet,  and  heard 
his  word.

THE  SEVENTY  DISCIPLES  SENT  OUT. 


H3 


40  But  Martha  was  cumbered  about  much  serving,  and  came  to  him,  and  said. 
Lord,  dost  thou  not  care  that  my  sister  hath  left  me  to  serve  alone  ? bid  her  there 
fore  that  she  help  me. 

41  And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  her,  Martha,  Martha,  thou  art  careful  and 
troubled  about  many  things  : 

42  But  one  thing  Is  needful : and  Mary  hath  chosen  that  good  part,  which  shall 
not  be  taken  away  from  her. 

Ver.  1. — After  these  things  the  Lord  appointed  other  seventy  also. 
Seventy-two.  Vulgate.  Dorotheus  and  others  profess  to  give  their 
names,  but  Eusebius  declares  that  he  knew  of  no  written  list  of 
these  seventy  disciples,  although  the  names  of  some  might  be 
gathered  from  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  e.g.,  Matthias  and  Barsabas, 
Acts  L ; Stephen  and  the  other  Deacons,  Acts  vi. ; Ananias  and 
Barnabas,  Acts  ix. ; Mnason,  Acts  xxi.,  and  others.  Here  observe, 

1.  That  as  Moses  at  the  beginning  of  his  leadership  chose  elders 
or  princes  for  the  twelve  tribes  of  Israel,  and  afterwards,  by  reason 
of  the  increase  of  the  people  and  of  the  cares  of  government,  made 
a further  choice  of  six  from  each  tribe,  i.e.  of  seventy-two,  to  act  as 
rulers : so  Christ  ordained  that  each  tribe  should  have  its  Apostle, 
and  six  presbyters  or  elders,  for  such  were  these  disciples,  who  were 
commanded  to  go  throughout  all  Judaea,  preaching  that  the  king- 
dom of  God  and  of  Christ  was  nigh,  and  confirming  their  preaching 
by  miracles,  that  so  the  work  of  the  Apostles  might  be  furthered 
and  spread. 

2.  This  number  was  mystically  prefigured  by  the  seventy-two 
translators  of  the  Septuagint ; by  the  “ men  of  the  elders  of  the 
people  ” whom  Moses  chose  (Numbers  xi.  16) ; by  the  number  of  the 
Sanhedrim,  and  by  the  wells  and  palm  trees  of  Elim,  Exod.  xv.  27. 

Again,  the  seventy-two  disciples,  saith  Bede,  answer  to  the 
seventy-two  nations  of  the  world,  as  if  Christ  had  appointed  to  each 
nation  its  own  disciple  or  teacher.  For  S.  Augustine,  S.  Jerome, 
and  others  hold  that  after  the  confusion  of  tongues,  mankind 
was  divided  into  seventy-two  nations  and  languages.  See  Gen.  x.  32. 

3.  Hence,  it  is  clear  that  there  was  distinction  and  difference  in 
the  degrees  and  duties  of  the  priests.  For  these  disciples  were  not 
equal  in  dignity  to  the  Apostles;  indeed  Matthias,  who  was.

S.  LUKE,  C.  X. 


according  to  Clement  of  Alexandria,  one  of  their  number,  was 
chosen  from  them  to  the  Apostolate,  Acts  L Hence  the  Fathers 
teach  that  the  Bishops  are  the  successors  of  the  Apostles,  and  the 
priests  of  the  seventy  disciples.  Although,  in  the  early  days  of  the 
Church,  saith  Bede,  both  the  one  and  the  other  were  called 
Presbyters  or  Bishops,  in  the  one  case  to  signify  the  ripeness  of 
their  wisdom,  in  the  other  case  their  zeal  in  the  pastoral  office. 

Symbolically . As  in  twenty-four  hours  the  whole  world  moves 
round  the  sun  and  receives  light,  so  is  the  world  enlightened  by 
Christ  through  the  Gospel  of  the  Trinity,  which  was  preached  at 
His  command  by  the  seventy-two  disciples.  For  three  times 
twenty-four  makes  seventy-two.  S.  Augustine  (Quasi.  Evang.) 

And  sent  them  two  and  two  before  His  Jace  into  every  city  and  place \ 
whither  He  Himself  would  come, , i.e.  into  Judaea,  as  He  had  before  sent 
the  twelve  Apostles  into  Galilee.  Jesus  wished  to  make  Himself 
known  to  the  Jews  as  the  Messiah,  and  to  offer  them  salvation 
through  faith  in  Him.  Therefore  as  He  was  Himself  unable  to  go 
throughout  their  towns  and  cities,  because  the  time  of  His  depar- 
ture was  now  nigh  at  hand,  He  chose  the  seventy  to  go  before 
Him  and  heal  the  sick,  that  the  minds  of  His  countrymen  might  be 
prepared  to  acknowledge  Him  as  the  Christ,  and  to  receive  at  His 
hands  pardon  and  forgiveness.  But  He  kept  the  twelve  Apostles 
with  Him  to  witness  to  His  life,  and  that  they  might  also  assist 
Him  in  ministering  to  the  necessities  of  those  who  waited  on  His 
teaching,  and  learn  how  in  their  turn  they  should  labour  for  the 
conversion  of  the  world. 

Two  by  two.  For  these  reasons : 

i.  That  the  one  might  aid  and  support  the  other,  as  Origen, 
Theophylact  and  S.  Gregory  say,  and  that  if  one  were  weary  or 
from  any  cause  unable  to  carry  on  the  work,  the  other  might  take 
his  place.  “ Two  are  better  than  one.  For  if  they  fall,  the  one  will 
lift  up  his  fellow : but  woe  to  him  that  is  alone  when  he  falleth.’ 
Eccles.  iv.  9,  io. 

Wherefore  Pachonius  rules : If  the  Superior  permit,  let  him  take 
a trustworthy  companion  and  then  go  forth  to  visit  a brother  or  a

neighbour.  And  again,  Let  no  one  be  sent  on  any  business  unless 
another  go  with  him.  S.  Augustine  writes,  When  ye  are  journeying, 
walk  together — when  at  your  journey's  end,  together  rest  And  so 
rule  all  the  other  founders  of  the  religious  orders. 

2.  That  one  may  always  have  in  the  other  a witness  to  his  life, 
and  an  adviser  and  guide.  Experience  teaches  us  that  they  who 
are  associated  together  two  by  two,  rarely  or  never  are  tempted  to 
sins  of  impurity,  but  that  those  who  are  alone  lay  themselves  open 
to  accusations  of  evil,  even  if  they  have  not  actually  fallen  away. 
Hence  S.  Thomas  was  wont  to  say,  A monk  away  from  his 
brethren  is  an  active  evil  S.  Augustine  rules  (Reg.  cap . xii.), 
When  ye  are  in  a church,  or  wheresoever  there  are  women,  let  each 
protect  the  other's  modesty.  For  thus  God,  who  dwelleth  in 
you,  will  protect  you  from  yourselves.  Another  writer,  S.  Jerome, 
enjoins : If  in  the  exercise  of  the  priestly  office,  thou  art  called  upon 
to  visit  a widow  or  a virgin,  enter  not  the  house  alone ; and  again, 
Abide  not  alone  with  any  woman,  unless  in  the  presence  of  a witness. 
So  also  S.  Basil.  Possidonius  also  tells  us  that  if  S.  Augustine  was 
asked  by  any  women  to  visit  them,  he  never  entered  their  house 
or  conversed  with  them,  even  on  private  matters,  unless  in  the 
presence  of  some  of  his  clergy.  And  so  S.  Charles  Borromeo  in 
our  times  adopted  the  rule  of  S.  Augustine,  for  he  never  conversed 
with  any  of  his  female  relations  except  one  of  his  upper  servants 
was  present  (Vita.  Lib.  vii.  cap.  vi).  And  Seneca  even  (Epist.  25), 
says,  " Solitude  tempts  us  to  every  evil ; " and  as  a corrective  adds, 
“ Without  doubt,  it  is  profitable  to  place  a guard  over  thyself,  so  as 
to  have  some  one  to  look  to,  some  one  to  be  acquainted  with  the 
very  thoughts ; " and  adds,  from  Epicurus,  " Do  everything  as  if  there 
was  some  one  beholding  thy  actions ; " and  again  (Epist.  ii.),  “ Most 
sins  would  be  avoided,  if  a man  had  a witness  beside  him  when  he 
was  about  to  sin.”  The  Emperor  Justinian  also  (De  Monachis\ 
decrees  that  monks  should  go  about  in  company,  “ to  bear  witness 
to  each  other's  integrity.”  And  Pope  Lucian  (Epist.  i.  ad  Episc.) 
decrees,  “ We  exhort  you,  for  reputation’s  sake,  that  according  to  the 
rule  of  our  holy  Church  ye  always  take  with  you  priests  and  deacons

as  witnesses  of  your  life  and  conversation;  for  although  ye  may 
have  a conscience  void  of  offence,  yet  because  of  evilly  disposed 
men,  it  behoveth  you,  as  the  Apostle  saith,  to  have  a good  report 
amongst  them  that  are  without.  1 Tim.  iii.  7.  Hence  we  have 
ordained  that,  as  a testimony  to  the  Church,  two  priests  or  three 
deacons  should  always  and  in  all  places  accompany  their  Bishop.” 

Lastly,  we  have  the  authority  of  S.  Thomas  of  Canterbury,  a man 
of  great  sanctity  and  wisdom,  who  says,  “ I who  have  been  for  thirty 
years  a Bishop  know  how  true  is  the  saying,  * Woe  to  him  that  is 
alone/  For  I have  frequently  heard  of  fearful  dangers,  and  fearful 
scandals  having  befallen  those  who  either  in  public  or  private 
affect  a solitary  life,  evils  into  which  they  would  not  have  fallen  had 
they  not  shunned  the  companionship  of  their  fellow  men.” 

3.  That  their  preaching  might  be  more  powerful  to  persuade.  At 
the  mouth  of  two  or  of  three  witnesses  shall  the  matter  be  estab- 
lished, Deut.  xix.  15.  So  we  find  Christ  and  His  apostles  con- 
stantly acting  on  this  rule.  For  Christ  sent  two  of  His  disciples, 
Peter  and  John,  to  loose  the  ass  and  to  prepare  the  passover. 
After  the  resurrection  Cleophas  and  a companion  went  to  Emmaus. 
In  like  manner  we  find  Peter  and  John  often  associated  together : 
they  run  both  to  the  sepulchre,  they  go  up  together  to  pray  at  the 
ninth  hour,  and  both  are  sent  to  Samaria  by  the  apostles. 

So  Paul  and  Barnabas  were  separated  for  the  work  of  the  Holy 
Spirit ; Silas  and  Judas,  sumamed  Barsabas,  sent  to  Antioch  ; and 
Paul  and  Silas  to  Syria;  and  according  to  the  universal  belief  of  the 
Church,  Enoch  and  Elias  will  re-appear  in  the  time  of  Antichrist 
as  witnesses  to  the  truth. 

Figuratively.  S.  Gregory  {horn.  17.  in  Evang.)  says,  The  Lord  sent 
His  disciples  two  by  two  to  preach,  because  the  precepts  of  charity 
are  two,  the  love  of  God  and  the  love  of  our  neighbour,  and 
charity  cannot  exist  without  at  least  two,  and  thereby  he  silently 
suggests  to  us  that  he  who  has  not  love  to  another  ought  not 
to  undertake  the  office  of  preaching. 

So  Origen.  It  seems  from  the  word  of  God  to  be  an  ancient 
custom,  that  two  should  be  associated  in  His  service.  For  God  led

THE  HARVEST  GREAT,  BUT  LABOURERS  FEW.  247 


Israel  out  of  Egypt  by  the  hands  of  Moses  and  Aaron.  Joshua  and 
Caleb  also  united  together  to  appease  the  people.  Hence  a 
brother  aided  by  a brother  is  as  a fortified  city.  So  two  by  two 
the  animals  entered  into  the  ark,  unclean  by  natural  generation,  but 
cleansed  by  the  sacrament  of  the  Church,  by  the  spiritual  grace 
attendant  on  the  preaching  of  the  disciples.  Gloss. 

Into  every  city  and  place,  whithtr  He  Himself  would  come.  Mysti- 
cally signifying,  as  S.  Gregory  says,  that  the  Lord  Himself  attends  on 
His  preachers.  For  the  words  of  the  preacher  persuade  men  of  the 
truth,  and  make  their  hearts  ready  to  be  the  abiding  place  of  Christ 
Hence  Isaiah,  chap.  xl.  3,  says,  “ Prepare  ye  the  way  of  the  Lord, 
make  straight  a highway  for  our  God.”  And  the  Psalmist,  “ Make 
a way  for  Him  who  ascendeth  upon  the  west,  the  Lord  is  His  name.” 
Ps.  lxvii.  5,  Douay  version. 

Ver.  2 — The  harvest  truly  ts  great,  but  the  labourers  are  few.  See 
S.  Matt  ix.  37. 

Ver.  3. — Go  your  ways  : behold \ 1 send  you  forth  as  lambs  among 
wolves . That  by  your  innocent  and  holy  lives,  through  the  power 
of  My  grace  working  in  you,  you  may  change  the  wolf  into  the 
lamb,  i.e.,  convert  evil  men  from  the  error  of  their  way.  Fear  not, 
therefore,  for  under  My  protection  no  harm  can  befall  you.  For, 
as  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ the  good  Shepherd  takes  care  that  the  wolves 
do  His  flock  no  harm.” 

Ver.  4. — Carry  neither  purse  (provide  neither  gold,  nor  silver, 
nor  brass  in  your  purse,  S.  Matt,  x.)  nor  scrip . Neither  purse  for 
money,  nor  scrip  for  food ; for  the  Shepherd  will  supply  both  if 
needful.  He  commands  them  to  look  to  Him  who  sent  them  forth 
for  the  necessaries  of  life.  Euthymius. 

For  the  preacher  ought  to  have  such  trust  in  God,  that  although 
unprovided  with  the  expenses  of  their  present  life,  he  should  be 
convinced  that  they  will  not  fail  him ; lest  whilst  his  mind  is  taken 
up  with  things  temporal,  he  should  be  less  mindful  of  things  eternal. 
Sw  Gregory.  See  S.  Matt.  x.  For  Christ  here  gives  to  the  seventy 
disciples  the  same  commands  which  He  before  gave  to  His  twelve 
apostles.

a LUKE,  C.  X. 


And  salute  no  man  by  the  way . Do  not  turn  aside  to  salute  your 
friends  or  to  commune  with  your  acquaintances,  but  avoid  all  such 
delays,  and  devote  yourselves  entirely  to  the  preaching  of  My 
gospel.  SS.  Augustine,  Ambrose,  Gregory  and  others 

But  on  the  other  hand,  Euthymius  says,  Christ  means  not  that 
His  disciples  should  uncourteously  refuse  a passing  salutation. 
He  only  forbids  those  formal  greetings,*  which  are  hindrances  to  the 
ministry,  and  causes  of  offence.  So  writes  S.  Ambrose,  who  here 
alludes  to  the  command  of  Elijah,  “ If  thou  meet  any  man, 
salute  him  not;  and  if  any  salute  thee,  answer  him  not  again” 
(2  Kings  iv.  29) : a command  given  lest  Gehazi  might  enter  into 
converse  with  some  one  by  the  way,  and  thus  be  forgetful  of  the 
duty  he  was  sent  to  perform. 

Vcr.  7. — For  the  labourer  is  worthy  of  his  hire.  By  hire  we  must 
understand  not  money  or  its  equivalent,  but  food  and  nourishment 
For  the  preaching  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is  above  price  Hence 
S.  Augustine  says  on  Ps.  ciiL  : What  do  they  receive  ? They  bestow 
spiritual  gifts,  they  receive  carnal ; they  give  gold,  they  receive  that 
which  is  worthless.  Therefore  it  is  clear  that  the  apostles  should  live 
by  the  gospel,  and  that  their  hearers  were  bound  by  every  law, 
natural  and  divine,  to  support  them.  They  were  forbidden  then 
to  carry  either  purse  or  scrip,  because  God  put  it  into  the  hearts  of 
those  that  attended  on  their  teaching  to  provide  for  all  their  wants. 
For  S.  Gregory  says  (Horn.  17),  He  who  forbids  us  to  carry  scrip  or 
purse,  ordains  that  we  should  live  of  the  gospeL  Because  it  is 
fitting  that  we  should  receive  earthly  things  from  those  to  whom  we 
offer  heavenly  rewards.  And  again,  Christ  shows  why  He  bade  His 
disciples  carry  neither  scrip  nor  purse,  not  because  these  things  are 
unneeded,  but  in  order  to  teach  that  it  was  the  duty  of  those  to 
whom  they  were  sent  to  supply  them.  S.  Augustine,  De  Consent. 
Evang.  lib.  ii. 

Ver.  16. — He  that  heareth  you  heareth  Me;  and  he  that  despiseth 
you  despiseth  Me.  For  you  are  my  apostles,  and  ambassadors.  And  he

great  ceremony,  and  therefore  productive  of  much  delay  and  waste  of  time.*’

THE  RETURN  OF  THE  SEVENTY.

who  despises  an  envoy  despises  the  monarch  who  sent  him.  There- 
fore we  ought  to  regard  the  commands  of  our  religious  superiors 
as  if  they  issued  from  the  mouth  of  Christ  Himself.  Hence  S. 
Bernard  (de  Prcecepto\  Whatever  God,  or  man  speaking  in  the  place 
of  God,  enjoins,  that — unless  contrary  to  the  known  will  of  the 
Almighty — must  be  looked  upon  as  a divine  command.  And  again, 
We  must  render  to  those  whom  God  has  put  over  us,  in  all  things 
lawful,  the  same  obedience  as  we  would  render  to  God.  See  further 
S.  Matt.  x.  and  xi. 

Ver.  17. — And  the  seventy  returned  with  joy  (great  joy,  Syriac), 
sayings  Lord \ even  the  devils  are  subject  to  us  through  Thy  name 
They  as  much  as  say,  We  have  not  only  healed  the  sick  according 
to  Thy  word,  ver.  9 ; but  have  even  cast  out  devils  through  the  power 
of  Thy  name.  See,  says  Theophylact,  their  humility,  for  they  say 
through  Thy  name,  not  by  our  own  power  or  virtue.  Yet  a certain 
amount  of  vain  glorying  seems  to  have  crept  in  unawares,  because 
Christ  had  chosen  them  in  preference  to  others  to  work  such 
wonders ; but  their  offence  was  a venial  one,  such  as  the  Master 
would  soon  absolve. 

Ver.  i& — And  He  said  unto  them , I beheld  Satan  as  lightning  fall 
from  heaven.  Like  lightning. 

1.  Unexpectedly:  because  as  the  lightning  bursts  forth  unex- 
pectedly from  a tranquil  sky,  so  were  the  devils  suddenly  cast  down 
from  heaven. 

2.  Violently,  by  the  power  of  Michael  and  his  angels,  Rev.  xii.  7. 

3.  Swiftly,  in  a moment  of  time. 

4.  Openly,  in  the  presence  of  all  the  inhabitants  of  heaven. 

Christ  took  example  from  the  lightning  to  show  how  great  and 

swift  was  the  fall  of  Satan.  Euthymius.  Many  think  that  Christ  here 
speaks  literally  of  the  fall  of  Satan  from  heaven,  i.e.  from  the  power 
of  which  he  possessed  over  the  world  before  the  coming  of  the 
Saviour. 

Ye  tell  me  no  new  thing,  O my  disciples,  for  when  I sent  you 
forth  I saw  the  devil  deprived  of  power,  falling  as  it  were  from 
heaven,  and  about  to  be  yet  more  discomfited  by  your  ministry.

S.  LUKE.  C.  X. 


Christ  saith  this  as  if  to  magnify  the  power  which  He  had  given  to 
the  disciples.  See  how  mighty  a foe  is  subject  to  you  through  My 
name.  So  Nazianzen,  S.  Basil,  and  well-nigh  all  the  Fathers. 

Hear  Theophylact.  Some  understand  by  the  word  heaven  the 
honour  and  glory  which  Satan  possessed,  for  before  the  coming  of 
Christ  he  was  worshipped  as  a god. 

Euthymius  also : Before  the  incarnation  Satan  was  had  in  honour, 
and  exercised  kingly  power, .but  he  fell,  not  from  heaven,  because  he 
had  already  fallen  from  it,  but  from  all  his  glory  and  power  when 
Christ  was  made  man.  So  also  Vatablus : When  I sent  you  forth  to 
preach  I saw,  saith  Christ,  that  the  power  of  Satan  would  be  broken. 
“ For”  says  S.  Cyril,  “ Satan  then  fell  from  the  heights  of  power  to  the 
extreme  of  weakness.”  He  was  venerated  by  men  before  the  coming 
of  Christ.  He  is  now  trodden  under  by  the  feet  of  the  faithful 
Hence  it  is  written,  “ I give  you  power  to  tread  upon  serpents.* 
But  this  allusion  to  the  fall  of  Satan  is  mystical  and  symbolical 
rather  than  literal.  Literally  Christ  speaks  of  Satan’s  fall  from 
heaven,  i.e.  of  the  time  when  he  and  his  angels  were  cast  into  the 
abyss,  because  through  pride  he  sought  to  make  himself  equal  with 
God,  or  because,  as  others  think,  he  endeavoured  to  hinder  the 
purpose  of  God  in  the  incarnation  of  Christ 

Because,  therefore,  he  envied  the  Divinity  of  Christ,  he  was  cast 
out  of  heaven.  The  Greek  word  moira  is  in  the  past  tense,  and 
should  therefore  be  translated  as  in  the  Arabic,  “fallea”  The 
whole  passage,  therefore,  may  be  rendered  thus,  “ Wonder  not,  O My 
disciples,  that  through  My  name  ye  have  cast  out  devils ; for  I long 
since  cast  out  of  heaven  Lucifer  and  his  angels,  because  of  their 
pride  and  discontent  But  beware  lest  ye  give  way  to  pride,  because 
the  devils  are  subject  unto  you,  and  lest  ye  also  for  this  cause  incur 
a like  punishment”  So  S.  Jerome,  and  all  the  Fathers.* 

But  very  appropriately  is  Lucifer  compared  to  lightning. 

* Taken  literally,  the  following  is  the  better  interpretation  : “I  foresaw  that 

by  your  preaching  the  power  of  Satan  would  be  quickly  broken,*’  or  what  amounts 
to  the  same  thing,  M Whilst  ye  were  absent  preaching  and  working  miracles  in 
obedience  to  My  command,  I saw  the  power  of  Satan  growing  weak,  and  Satan, 
as  it  were,  cast  down  from  heaven.”

SATAN  DISCOMFITED.  2$  I 

1.  Because  by  the  brilliancy  of  lightning  is  very  aptly  shown  the 
pre-eminence  and  fiery  nature  of  Lucifer. 

2.  And  also  his  excessive  power  to  do  hurt  For  as  the  lightning 
shatters  the  hardest  rock,  so  Satan  overpowers  all  opposition. 

3.  Because  of  the  shortness  of  his  reign.  For  as  the  flash  is 
quickly  gone,  so  the  dominion  of  Satan  lasts  but  for  this  life,  which 
is  but  as  a moment  compared  with  eternity. 

Hence,  figuratively,  lightning  is  an  emblem  of  this  world’s  glory. 
For  as  it  flashes,  and  is  quickly  gone,  “ so  passes  away  the  glory  of 
this  world.” 

Furthermore,  as  the  brilliant  lightning  loses  itself  in  the  earth,  so 
Lucifer,  a bright  angel,  became  through  pride  a foul  fiend,  and  thus 
pride  makes  the  best  of  men  to  become  devils,  whilst  humility  makes 
angels  of  the  worst  See  Isa.  xiv.  n.  “Thy  pomp  is  brought 
down  to  the  grave,  the  worm  is  spread  under  thee,  and  the  worms 
cover  thee.” 

4.  Because  of  his  outward  appearance,  “ for  he  transforms  himselt 
into  an  angel  of  light,”  2 Cor.  xi.  14. 

The  full  meaning  of  this  verse  is  as  follows : — I,  saith  Christ,  as 
God  saw  the  fall  of  Satan  when  he  was  cast  out  from  heaven,  and  in 
like  manner,  I now,  as  the  Son  of  man,  see  him  cast  out  of  the 
temples  in  which  he  was  worshipped,  because  I teach,  and  in  My 
name  ye  also  teach,  the  nations  to  break  up  their  idols  and  to 
worship  God  alone.  Hence,  as  I cast  him  out  of  heaven,  so  now  I 
deprive  him  of  his  power  over  men.  “ How  art  thou  fallen,  O 
Lucifer,  son  of  the  morning.  How  is  the  light  which  was  in  thee 
become  darkness.”  See  Isa.  xiv.  1 2. 

Moraliter . S.  Bernard,  in  his  sermon,  on  1 Cor.  iii.  12,  says, 

“ There  is  no  security  in  heaven  or  in  paradise,  much  less  in  the 
world.  In  heaven  the  angels  fell  in  the  very  presence  of  God ; 
in  the  garden  of  Eden,  Adam ; in  the  world,  Judas,  a disciple  of 
Christ.  I have  said  this,  that  no  man  lull  himself  into  false  security 
because  ‘a  place  is  holy  ground.’  For  it  is  not  the  place  which 
sanctifies  the  men,  but  the  men  who  sanctify  the  place.” 

Mystically . S.  Jerome,  Ps.  cxxiv.  8,  says,  “ Many  earthly

things  became  heavenly,  and  many  heavenly  things  earthly.”  The 
traitor  Judas  was  offered  heaven,  but  chose  eaith.  The  apostle 
Paul,  when  persecuting  the  Church,  was  the  enemy  of  Christ ; but 
converted,  he  became  meet  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  Let  him, 
whose  conversation  is  in  heaven,  beware  of  false  security ; and  let 
not  him  who  yet  loves  the  world,  despair  of  salvatioa 

Ver.  19. — Behold \ 1 five  you  power  to  tread  on  serpents  and 
scorpions . Power  f£ou*/ai»,  i.e.  authority.  We  may  take  the  words 
literally,  for  to  Adam  was  given  dominion  over  every  living  thing. 
Christ  then  gives  His  disciples  power  over  the  wild  animals  as  well 
as  over  devils.  “They  shall  take  up  serpents,  and  if  they  drink 
any  deadly  thing,  it  shall  not  hurt  them.”  S.  Mark  xvi.  17.  And 
so  S.  Paul  shook  off  the  viper  which  had  fastened  on  his  hand,  and 
felt  no  harm.  Acts  xxviii.  5.  Jansenius,  Maldonatus,  and  others. 

And  over  all  the  power  of  the  enemy , dwoyuv  rendered  in  the 
Vulgate  “ virtutem,”  whether  wild  animal,  or  poison,  or  Satan  him- 
self. For  by  all  the  power  of  the  enemy  we  may  understand  every- 
thing hostile  to  men. 

But  mystically,  the  passage  has  reference  to  the  devils,  who  are 
described  as  serpents  and  scorpions,  and  called  the  power  of  the 
enemy,  i.e.  the  army  of  Satan.  S.  Athanasius,  Theophylact  and 
others. 

Hence  Euthymius  takes  these  serpents  and  scorpions  as  influ- 
encing the  senses,  or,  as  Bede  says,  “representing  every  kind  of 
unclean  spirit”  He  adds,  “ There  is  this  difference  between  serpents 
which  wound  with  their  fangs,  and  scorpions  whose  sting  is  in  their 
tail,  that  the  serpents  signify  men  or  spirits  raging  openly,  scorpions 
signify  them  plotting  in  secret  Thus  by  the  serpent  which 
deceived  Eve,  we  must  understand  the  devil  in  the  serpent’s  form. 
See  Gen.  chap.  iii. 

Ver.  20. — Notwithstanding  in  this  rejoice  notf  that  the  spirits  are 
subject  unto  you.  He  does  not  forbid  them  altogether  from  rejoicing 
in  that  the  spirits  were  subject  unto  them,  for  this  was  a lawful  joy, 
but  he  exhorts  them  to  rejoice  rather  at  their  election  to  eternal  life. 

1.  Because  power  over  the  devils  is  a grace  given  to  the  Church,

and  sometimes  bestowed  upon  the  unworthy,  as  Judas.  S.  Matt 
vil  22.  But  predestination  brings  men  into  favour  with  God,  and 
ends  in  everlasting  happiness. 

2.  Because,  as  Euthymius  says,  “The  one  joy* is  productive  of 
pride  and  vainglory,  but  the  other  of  good  works,  and  a desire  to 
please  God. 

3.  Again,  because  the  casting  out  of  devils  and  the  working  of 
miracles  is  due  to  the  power  of  God,  and  is  independent  of  human 
merit.  But  they  whose  names  are  written  in  heaven,  at  some  time 
present  or  future  are  made  meet  for  so  great  a reward.  Bede. 

4.  Lastly,  because  to  cast  out  devils  affects  others,  but  it  is  for 
our  own  profit  that  our  names  are  written  in  heaven.  Theophylact 

Are  written  in  heaven , “in  the  book  of  life,”  not  by  pen  and 
ink,  says  Titus,  but  by  the  foreknowledge  and  election  of  God. 
Ye  are  citizens  inscribed  on  the  roll  of  an  eternal  city,  not  after  the 
manner  of  men,  but  written  down  in  the  remembrances  of  God 
Euthymius.  Not,  says  Bede,  because  God  can  forget,  but  that  His 
purpose  may  stand  fast  for  ever. 

Hence,  as  the  foreknowledge  and  election  of  God  are  twofold,  so 
is  the  book  of  life.  The  one  perfect  and  complete,  in  which  are  the 
names  of  those  who  are  predestinated  to  eternal  life.  The  other 
imperfect  and  incomplete,  because  they  whose  names  are  written 
in  it  may  fall  away,  and  forfeit  their  promised  reward.  So  the 
Apostle  salutes  Clement  and  his  fellow-labourers,  “whose  names 
are  written  in  the  book  of  life  ” (Phil  iv.)  meaning  thereby  that 
they,  like  the  Ephesian  converts,  were  called  by  God  and  pre- 
destinated by  Christ  to  believe  on  Him,  but  that  their  final  salvation 
was  conditional  on  their  perseverance  and  faith.  Eph.  i.  And 
again,  Eph.  ii.  19,  “Ye  are  fellow  citizens  with  the  saints,  and  of  the 
household  of  God  : * by  grace  here  and  in  the  glory  hereafter,  if  ye 
depart  not  from  the  grace  which  is  given  you.  So  the  Church  in 
the  “Secreta”  for  Lent  prays,  that  the  names  of  all  believers  may 
be  retained  in  the  book  of  God’s  predestination.  These  then  can 
forfeit  their  election,  and  therefore  their  salvation  is  conditional  on 
their  perseverance  in  well  doing.  For  this  is  the  interpretation  of

Jansenius,  Francis  Lucas,  and  others,  though  Maldonatus  doubts 
whether  it  be  the  right  one,  and  Toletus  refuses  to  accept  it 

For  it  is  clear  from  ver.  18  that  Christ  did  not  give  the  seventy 
disciples  to  understand  that  they  were  absolutely  and  unconditionally 
predestinated  to  glory,  for  He  would  have  them  mindful  of  con- 
demnation. As  Satan  fell  from  heaven,  so  take  heed  lest  ye  also 
come  short  of  the  glory  prepared  for  you  in  heaven.  So  all  the 
apostles  were  called  by  Christ,  and  yet  one  of  them  was  a reprobate. 
“ Have  I not  chosen  you  twelve,  and  one  of  you  is  a devil  ? ” S.  John 
vl  70.  And  also  among  the  deacons,  who  were  chosen  from  the 
seventy  was  Nicolas,  a man  of  impure  life  and  the  author  of  the 
heresy  of  the  Nicolaitanes.  S.  Jerome,  Epist  48. 

Hence  we  must  understand  the  promise  of  Christ  (S.  Matt  xix. 
28),  “Ye  which  have  followed  me,  shall  sit  on  twelve  thrones  judging 
the  twelves  tribes  of  Israel,”  to  be  conditional,  i.e.  to  be  fulfilled  only 
if  they  continued  to  follow  Him  to  their  life’s  end. 

Ver.  21. — In  that  hour  Jesus  rejoiced  in  spirit  (Spiritu  Sancto, 
Vulgate),  because  the  Holy  Spirit  had,  according  to  His  promise, 
granted  the  disciples,  though  weak  and  unlearned  men,  the  power 
of  working  wonders,  and  had  thus  led  others  to  believe  in  Christ  and 
to  glorify  God. 

And  hast  revealed  them  unto  babes , i.e.  that  thou  hast  revealed 
to  my  humble  and  unlearned  disciples  the  truth,  so  that  they  might 
acknowledge  Thee,  the  one  true  God,  and  Me  whom  Thou  hast  sent, 
and  might  be  predestinated  to  eternal  life ; and  that  many  others 
also,  whom  they  have  healed  of  their  diseases,  and  from  whom  they 
have  cast  out  devils,  might  be  brought  to  the  knowledge  of  God,  and 
believe  to  the  salvation  of  their  soul 

Ver.  22. — All  things  are  delivered  to  Me  of  My  Father . As  all 
things  were  created  by  My  Father,  so  all  things  are  created  anew  by 
Me,  and  redeemed  from  the  curse  of  sin.  That  thus  I might  raise 
up  those  who  had  fallen  away,  and  might  sanctify  them,  and  might 
renew  all  the  other  creatures  which  had  become  corrupt  through  the 
sin  of  man. 

“For,”  says  S.  Athanasius  (Sertn.  iv.  contra  Arianos),  “ after  the  fall

THE  LAWYER’S  QUESTION,  TEMPTING  JESUS.  255 


of  man,  all  things  were  made  partakers  of  his  transgression.  And 
so  death  reigned  over  all  from  Adam  even  unto  Christ  The  earth 
was  given  over  to  the  curse,  hell  was  opened,  paradise  shut,  heaven 
became  an  enemy,  and  mankind  being  corrupted  and  lost,  the  devil 
triumphed  over  us.” 

“ Then  He  gave  Him  a human  nature,  that  the  Word  Himself 
might  take  upon  Him  our  flesh,  and  might  rfenew  in  all  the  nature 
He  had  taken. 

“ All  things  were  delivered  unto  Him  as  the  physician  who  could 
heal  the  serpent’s  bite,  as  the  life  which  could  restore  the  dead,  ks 
the  light  which  could  illuminate  the  darkness,  as  the  understanding 
which  could  renew  the  powers  of  the  mind.” 

And  in  explanation,  he  adds,  “ After  all  things  were  delivered  to 
Him,  and  he  was  made  man,  all  things  were  renewed  and  made 
perfect  again.  The  earth  received  a blessing  instead  of  a curse, 
paradise  was  unlocked.  Hell  drew  back  from  fear,  the  graves  gave 
up  their  dead,  and  the  gates  were  thrown  open  that  He  might  enter 
from  Eden.” 

Christ  does  not  speak  here  of  the  essence  and  attributes  which  were 
communicated  to  Him  from  the  Father  by  His  divine  generation,  as 
S.  Chrysostom,  Hilary,  and  S.  Ambrose  explain,  but  of  the  plenary 
power  which  was  given  to  Him  as  man,  to  effect  the  salvation 
of  men. 

Ver.  25. — And,  behold,  a certain  lawyer  stood  up.  " What  ought  I 
to  do  to  obtain  eternal  life  ? ” This  lawyer  is  not  the  same  as 
the  one  mentioned  by  S.  Matt.  xxii.  35,  as  is  clear  from  the  circum- 
stances there  recorded. 

And  tempted  Him . He  asked  the  question,  not  for  any  good 
motive,  but  with  the  design  of  tempting  Christ  to  give  some  answer 
concerning  Himself  or  His  doctrine,  which  might  lay  Him  open  to 
the  charge  of  being  a breaker  or  a despiser  of  the  law.  Toletus. 

Ver.  29. — But  he,  willing  to  justify  himself.  To  justify  himself,  i.e. 
to  show  himself  to  be  more  just  than  others.  “ Show  me  any  one 
who  comes  nigh  me  in  righteousness,  who  is  as  just  and  upright  as 
I am.  Such  an  one  you  will  scarcely  find.”  So  Titus,  Euthymius,

and  Isidore  of  Pelusium,  who  think  that  the  lawyer  spoke  with  the. 
pride  and  arrogance  of  a Pharisee. 

“ He  thought,”  says  Isidore,  “ that  the  neighbour  of  a righteous 
man  must  be  righteous,  and  the  neighbour  of  an  exalted  man  one 
of  high  degree.  Show  me  some  one  so  great  as  to  be  worthy  to 
be  compared  with  me.” 

But  the  answer  of  Christ  proved  the  contrary,  as  is  clear  from  a 
consideration  of  the  passage.  For  when  this  lawyer  heard  Christ 
commend  the  answer  he  had  given,  his  purpose  changed,  and  his 
aversion  turned  into  love  and  reverence  for  the  Lord.  Hence  he 
earnestly  asked,  Who  is  my  neighbour  ? that  by  loving  him  he  might 
fulfil  the  law. 

Hence,  “ willing  to  justify  himself,”  means  that  he  wished  to 
show  his  love  for  that  which  was  right,  that  he  was  anxious  out  of 
an  awakened  conscience  to  understand  and  learn  the  law  of  God,  in 
order  that  he  might  fulfil  its  precepts.  Toletus,  Jansenius,  and 
others. 

And  who  is  my  neighbour  t There  was  much  questioning  amongst 
the  scribes  concerning  this,  and  much  error.  For  because  it  is 
written,  Lev.  xix.  18,  “ Thou  shalt  love  thy  friend  ” (JH  rea),  they 
inferred  the  contrary,  11  thou  shalt  hate  thy  enemy,”  i.e.  the  Gentile, 
every  one  not  a Jew  : an  error  which  Christ  corrected,  S.  Matt  v.  43. 

Hence  the  scribes  thought  that  the  Jew  alone,  as  a worshipper  of 
the  one  true  God,  and  of  the  same  religion  and  race,  could  be  a 
friend,  or  a neighbour,  and  even  of  their  countrymen  only  those 
who  were  faithful  in  their  observance  of  the  law,  were  to  be  loved  or 
to  be  held  in  honour. 

Well,  therefore,  might  this  lawyer  ask,  Who  is  my  neighbour?  I 
love  all  my  countrymen  who  walk  uprightly,  and  regard  them  as  my 
neighbours,  but  are  there  others  whom  I ought  to  love?  Christ 
answers  that  all  men  are  our  neighbours,  because  they  partake  of 
the  same  life,  the  same  grace,  the  same  salvation  through  Christ,  the 
same  sacraments,  the  same  vocation  and  calling,  and  are  journeying 
with  us  to  the  same  eternity  of  happiness. 

Every  man,  therefore,  is  our  “rea,”  our  iriend  and  our  fellow;

or  in  the  Greek  wX*<t/©$,  near  to  us,  from  «X«£«  or  tXoh,  I draw  nigh, 
which  is  more  forcibly  rendered  in  Latin  by  “ proximus,”  because 
we  are  “proximi,”  next  or  nearest  to  each  other  in  a direct  sense 
by  virtue  of  the  life  we  live  in  common  with  them,  and  the  blessings 
which  we  enjoy. 

But  by  proximus  Cicero  and  the  Latins  understood  vicinissimus, 
i.e.  neighbour  in  the  strictest  sense.  Hence  Isidore  (lib.  x.  etymol.) 
We  call  him  the  nearest  to  us,  who  is  next  of  kin ; and  Cicero  (lib. 
ii  De  legibus ),  “Whatever  is  best,  that  we  must  look  upon  as  next  or 
nigh  unto  God.”  But  now  all  men  are  our  neighbours  by  creation, 
and  by  their  redemption  and  calling  in  Christ. 

Figuratively.  The  word  “neighbour”  is  suggestive  of  the  ten- 
derest  affection  and  love,  such  as  that  of  brother  for  brother,  or  of 
a son  for  his  father,  for  no  one  comes  between  them,  inasmuch  as 
there  is  no  nigher  relationship ; yet  there  are  degrees  of  this  love, 
for  we  must  love  our  father  more  than  our  brother,  and  our  brother 
more  than  any  more  distant  relation,  for  amongst  our  nearest  of 
kin  one  is  nearer  to  us  than  another,  and  therefore  more  to  be  loved. 

Ver.  30. — And  Jesus  answering  said.  Taking  up  or  continuing 
His  discourse.  Euthymius.  J.e.  answering  the  lawyer,  and  explaining 
fully  and  clearly  to  whom  “ neighbour  ” applied. 

A certain  man  went  down  from  Jerusalem  to  Jericho , and  fell 
among  thieves.  A Jew,  S.  Augustine  says ; and  an  inhabitant  of  the 
holy  city.  Bede. 

The  parable  is  founded  on  incidents  of  at  that  time  frequent 
occurrence,  and  is  therefore  a true  history.  For,  as  S.  Jerome  ob- 
serves, between  Jerusalem  and  Jericho  was  a place  infested  with 
robbers,  called  in  the  Hebrew  tongue  Adommim,  or  rather 
Addammim,  ie.  red  or  bloody,  because  of  the  blood  which  was 
shed  there.  So  Adrichomius  describes  Adommim  as  a place  in- 
famous even  in  later  times  for  robberies  and  murders,  terrible  to 
behold,  and  so  dangerous  that  no  one  dared  to  pass  through  it 
without  an  escort 

There  the  Samaritan  met  with  this  man  who,  like  many  another 

traveller,  had  been  grievously  wounded  by  robbers.  The  place

itself  lay  four  leagues  to  the  west  of  Jericho,  and  was  situated  on 
the  confines  of  Judah  and  Benjamin.  A fort  had  been  built  there, 
and  garrisoned  with  soldiers,  for  the  protection  of  travellers.  Close 
by  was  a large  cavern,  and  the  country  round  was  hilly,  so  that 
robbers  could  see  from  afar  the  approaching  wayfarer,  and  lie  in 
ambush  to  attack  him.  Hence  in  Joshua  xv.  7 the  place  is  called 
the  going  up  to  Adommim. 

Which  stripped  him  of  his  raiment,  and  wounded  him  , and  departed, \ 
leaving  him  half  dead.  Stripped  him  of  his  raiment,  money,  and  all 
that  he  had,  and  left  him  half  dead  by  the  wayside,  where  he 
would  have  died  of  his  wounds  had  no  one  come  to  succour  him. 
For  it  is  the  custom  of  robbers,  in  order  to  avoid  detection,  to 
murder  their  victims.  The  Syriac  version  makes  the  meaning  clear. 
“They  wounded  him,  and  left  him  when  there  was  scarce  any  life 
remaining  in  him.1’ 

Ver.  31. — And  by  chance  there  came  down  a certain  priest  that 
way : and  when  he  saw  him , he  passed  by  on  the  other  side.  By 
chance,  humanly  speaking,  but  really  by  the  providence  of  God,  for 
all  things  are  foreordained  by  Him.  Passed  by  on  the  other  side, 
“ The  priest,  terrified  at  his  appearance,  turned  away 
from  him,  and  went  by  on  the  other  side.  Christ  here  draws  atten- 
tion to  the  perversity  of  the  priests  of  that  day,  who  were  zealous  in 
carrying  out  all  the  outward  observances  of  the  law,  but  were  utterly 
wanting  in  true  religion  and  in  showing  mercy  and  pity.  For  this 
priest  left  his  fellow-countryman  and  neighbour  in  his  direst  distress 
without  even  a word  of  consolation  or  comfort 

Ver.  32. — And  likewise  a Levite , when  he  was  at  the  place , came  and 
looked  on  him,  and  passed  by  on  the  other  side.  The  Levite  amongst 
the  Jews,  like  the  deacons  in  the  Church,  assisted  the  priest  in  his 
ministrations.  He  was  therefore  of  one  mind  with  the  priest,  for 
as  the  priest  so  is  the  Levite,  as  the  prelate  so  the  deacon,  as  the 
master  so  the  servant,  as  the  teacher  so  the  disciple.  And  so  he 
also  passed  by  on  the  other  side. 

Ver.  33. — But  a certain  Samaritan,  as  he  tourneyed , came  where  he 
was : and  when  he  saw  him , he  had  compassion  on  him,  A Samaritan

one  of  an  entirely  different  race  and  religion,  and  therefore,  as  a 
heretic  and  schismatic,  more  hateful  to  the  Jews  than  any  other 
of  the  Gentiles.  Yet  this  despised  Samaritan  had  pity  on  the  poor 
traveller  who  had  been  abandoned  by  both  priest  and  Levite. 
Hence  we  learn  that  not  only  our  friends  but  also  our  enemies  are 
our  neighbours,  and  Christ  holds  up  this  Samaritan  as  an  example 
of  brotherly  kindness  and  love,  because  he  had  compassion  on  one 
who  was  hateful  to  himself  and  his  people. 

Ver.  34. — And  went  to  him,  and  bound  up  his  wounds , pouring  in 
oil  and  wine . Went  to  him,  got  off  the  horse  or  the  ass  on  which 
he  was  riding,  and  poured  into  the  wounds  the  oil  and  wine  which 
he  carried  with  him  as  refreshment  for  the  way. 

The  order  is  inverted.  He  first,  in  accordance  with  the  practice 
of  the  physicians  of  that  day,  washed  the  wounds  with  wine ; for 
wine  (1.)  removes  the  coagulated  blood ; (2.)  arrests  corruption ; (3.) 
closes  the  wound  and  strengthens  the  nerves  against  the  effects  of 
the  bruises. 

Then  he  anointed  the  wounds  with  oil — (1.)  To  sooth  their  smart ; 
(2.)  to  allay  the  pain ; and  (3.)  to  help  forward  the  cure. 

Hence  S.  Gregory  says  (lib.  xx.  chap . 8,  Moral),  By  wine  we  may 
understand  the  gnawings  of  conscience ; by  oil  the  healing  influences 
of  religion — and  so  mildness  must  be  mingled  with  severity  if  we 
would  heal  the  wounds  of  the  soul,  and  rescue  sinners  from  the 
power  of  sin.  But  S.  Chrysostom  considers  the  wine  to  be  the 
blood  of  the  Passion,  the  oil  the  unction  wherewith  we  are  anointed, 
ie.  the  unction  of  the  Holy  Spirit  Interlinear  Gloss. 

And  set  him  on  his  own  beast . On  his  ass.  Syriac. 

Allegorically.  S.  Augustin  explains  the  beast  to  mean  the  flesh 
of  Christ,  and  to  be  set  thereon,  to  believe  in  the  incarnation.  S. 
Ambrose  says,  He  places  us  on  His  beast  whilst  He  bears  our  sins ; 
and  Theophylact,  He  made  us  to  be  His  members  and  partakers 
of  His  body.

And  took  care  of  him.  Providing  everything  which  his  case 
required. 

Ver.  35. — And  on  the  morrow  when  he  departed , he  took  out  two 
pence — i.e.  not  two  pence  in  the  ordinary  signification  of  the  words, 
but  sufficient  to  supply  the  wants  of  the  wounded  man  until 
his  return.  S.  Augustine  says,  “The  two  pence  are  the  two 
precepts  of  love,  which  the  apostles  received  for  the  evangelising 
of  the  world,  or  the  promise  of  this  life,  and  of  that  which  is 
to  come.” 

And  gave  them  to  the  host,  &c.  Learn  hence  how  great  was  the 
love  of  the  Samaritan,  for  he  provided  everything  that  was  needful 
for  the  poor  traveller's  cure. 

Allegorically . The  traveller  is  Adam  wounded,  and  all  but  dead 
in  trespasses  and  sins.  For  Adam  went  from  Jerusalem  to  Jericho 
when  he  fell  from  grace  into  the  power  of  Satan.  For  the  thieves 
are  the  evil  spirits  who  tempted  Adam  and  Eve  to  sin,  and 
corrupted  the  souls  of  all  with  the  lust  of  concupiscence.  The 
priest  and  Levite  represent  the  ancient  law,  which  was  unable  to 
remedy  the  consequences  of  Adam's  fall. 

The  Samaritan  is  Christ,  by  whom  men  are  rescued  from  sin  and 
promised  salvation.  The  beast  is  his  human  nature,  to  which  the 
divine  is  united,  and  on  which  it  is  carried  and  borne.  The  inn 
is  the  Church,  which  receives  all  believers.  The  wine  is  the  blood 
of  Christ,  by  which  we  are  cleansed  from  sin.  The  oil  represents 
his  mercy  and  pity.  The  host,  who  is  the  head  of  the  inn,  ue,  of 
the  Church,  is  S.  Peter.  So  S.  Ambrose,  Origen,  and  the  Fathers. 

Hear  also  Origen  more  particularly : “ A certain  preacher  thus 
interprets  the  parable.  The  man  who  went  down  from  Jerusalem 
is  Adam.  Jerusalem  is  Paradise,  Jericho  the  world.  The  thieves 
are  the  powers  which  are  against  us.  The  priest  is  the  law,  the 
Levite,  the  prophets.  The  Samaritan  is  Christ  The  beast  whereon 
he  sat,  the  body  of  the  Lord,  i.e.  His  humanity.  The  inn  the 
Church.  By  the  two  pieces  of  money  we  may  understand  the 
Father  and  the  Son,  and  by  the  host,  the  head  of  the  Church,  him 
to  whom  its  governance  is  committed.  The  return  of  the  Samaritan

is  the  second  coming  of  the  Lord ; ” and  this  interpretation  seems 
reasonable  and  true. 

Again  the  Fathers  and  Theologians  teach  from  this  parable  that 
Adam  was  stripped  of  those  gifts  and  good  things  which  were  of 
grace,  but  wounded  in  those  things  which  were  of  nature,  not  indeed 
in  his  nature  pure  and  incorrupt,  for  nature  is  the  same  after  sin  as 
before,  but  in  his  nature  stablished  by  grace,  cleansed  and  renewed 
by  justification  imputed  by  God.  For  in  a nature  of  this  kind  all 
the  appetites  and  passions  as  well  as  the  lust  of  concupiscence  are 
subjected  to  the  understanding,  so  that  a man  does  not  wish  or 
desire  anything  but  that  which  is  right  For  deprived  through  sin 
of  original  justification  we  experience  in  ourselves,  unwittingly  and 
contrary  to  our  will,  evil  desires.  This  is  the  wound  which  nature 
has  received. 

Ver.  36. — Which  now  of  these  three,  thinkest  thou , was  neighbour 
unto  him  that  fell  among  the  thieves?  The  true  meaning  of  the 
passage  is  this,  Which  of  these  three  seems  to  thee  to  have  acted  as 
neighbour  to  the  wounded  man  ? and  in  this  sense  it  was  understood 
by  the  lawyer  who  answered,  “ He  that  showed  mercy  upon  him.” 
Christ  asked  the  lawyer  which  of  the  three  by  his  actions  showed 
that  he  looked  upon  the  wounded  man  as  a neighbour.  For 
neighbour  is  a correlative  term,  and  a man  can  only  be  a neighbour 
to  a neighbour,  just  as  a man  can  only  be  compassionate  to  one 
who  needs  pity. 

Hence  Christ  indicates  the  one  by  the  other,  and  thus  answers 
the  lawyer’s  inquiry.  Christ  inverted  His  answer,  in  order  to  give 
an  example  of  the  perfection  of  brotherly  love,  so  that  the  lawyer 
and  all  men  might  learn  to  imitate  the  Samaritan.  Hence  Jesus 
said,  “ Go  and  do  thou  likewise,”  v.  37. 

So  also  in  the  parable  of  the  two  debtors,  Christ  asks,  “Which 
of  them  will  love  him  most?”  See  chap.  viL  42.  S.  Augustin, 
Bede,  and  all  the  Fathers. 

Ver.  37. — And  he  said \ He  that  showed  mercy  on  him.  Then  said 
Jesus  unto  him , Go,  and  do  thou  likewise.  Hereby  we  understand, 
says  S.  Augustine,  “ that  he  is  our  neighbour  to  whomsoever  we  must

S.  LUKE,  C.  X. 


6how  compassion,  if  he  need  it,  and  would  have  shown  it  if  he  had 
needed  it”  Hence  it  follows  that  even  he  who  must  in  turn  show 
us  this  duty  is  our  neighbour.  For  the  name  of  neighbour  relates 
to  something  else,  nor  can  any  one  be  a neighbour  except  to  a 
neighbour. 

Hence  it  is  clear  that  to  no  one,  not  even  to  our  enemy,  is  mercy 
to  be  denied.  And  S.  Augustin  very  appositely  adds,  “What 
more  remote  than  God  from  men?  For  God  possesses  two  per- 
fections, righteousness  and  immortality.  But  man  two  evils,  sin 
and  death.  God  was  made  man,  and  so  like  unto  us,  yet  not  like 
us,  for  He  was  without  sin,  and  by  bearing  the  punishment,  but  not 
the  guilt  of  sin,  He  abolished  both  the  guilt  and  the  punishment” 

Isidore  of  Pelusium  assigns  the  cause.  Relationship  is  reckoned 
according  to  nature,  not  virtue ; in  essence,  not  by  worth ; by 
compassion,  not  by  place;  by  the  manner  of  treatment,  not  by 
neighbourhood.  For  we  must  account  him  as  a neighbour  who  is 
most  in  need  of  our  aid,  and  be  willing  at  once  to  render  him  help. 

Ver.  38. — Now  it  came  to  pass , as  they  went , that  He  entered  into  a 
certain  village:  and  a certain  woman  named  Martha  received  Him 
into  her  house  As  they  went  preaching  the  Gospel,  v.  1.  “ A certain 
village probably  Bethany,  where  Martha  dwelt. 

The  servant,  says  S.  Augustine,  by  reason  of  His  condescension, 
not  His  condition,  received  her  Lord,  the  sick  the  Saviour,  the 
creature  the  Creator,  one  to  be  fed  in  spirit,  Him  who  must  be  fed 
in  the  flesh. 

The  hospitality  of  Martha  is  praised,  for  she  received  Jesus,  who 
was  hated  by  the  chief  priests  and  scribes,  and  in  receiving  Him 
she  received  God,  who  blessed  her  and  her  house,  and  after  death 
received  her  into  glory. 

Thus  Abraham  entertained  angels  unawares.  See  Heb.  xiii.  2. 

Hence  Christ  appeared  to  Martha  as  she  lay  dying,  and  as  a 
reward  for  her  hospitality  invited  her  to  His  heavenly  kingdom, 
and  it  is  added  on  the  authority  of  S.  Antonine,  that  the  Lord 
Himself  was  present  at  her  burial.  Thus  He  honours  those  who 
honour  Him.

Vcr  39. — And  she  had  a sister  called  Maryy  surnamed  Magdalene. 
They  were  sisters,  says  S.  Augustin,  not  only  by  their  parentage 
but  in  religion,  for  both  were  followers  of  Christ,  and  both  served 
Him  present  in  the  flesh — blessed  in  such  a guest 

Which  also  sat  at  Jesud  feet \ and  heard  His  word.  The  word 
“also”  shows  that  at  the  very  time  when  Mary  might  have  been 
assisting  her  sister  in  her  household  cares,  she  was  sitting  at  Jesus 
feet  showing  her  diligence  and  zeal  in  hearing,  and  the  great 
reverence  which  she  had  for  Christ 

As  by  sitting  at  Jesus’  feet  she  had  made  the  better  choice,  says 
S.  Augustine,  so  she  received  the  greater  benefit.  For  water  collects 
in  the  low-lying  valleys,  but  flows  down  the  acclivities  of  the  hills. 

And  heard  His  word.  Christ  here  teaches  His  disciples  how  they 
ought  to  behave  in  the  houses  of  those  who  receive  them,  for,  says 
S.  Chrysostom  (S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena),  “They  should  not  remain  idle, 
but  rather  fill  the  minds  of  those  who  receive  them  with  heavenly 
doctrine.”  That  no  time  may  be  without  fruit,  but  that  they  may 
everywhere  sow  the  seeds  of  religion,  and  excite  men  to  virtue  and 
to  the  love  of  God.  Thus  did  Peter  Faber,  the  first  companion 
of  S.  Ignatius  Loyola,  who  spent  his  whole  life  in  journeying 
amongst  his  fellowmen,  and  in  his  will  left  us  this  salutary  advice, 
that  when  we  enter  a house  we  should  recite  the  hours,  or  take 
part  in  religious  discourses,  to  show  the  reality  of  our  profession. 
For  thus  a stop  is  put  to  improper  conversation,  and  religion  is  the 
gainer.  Thus  he  more  than  once  by  his  discourse  moved  those 
whom  he  was  entertaining  to  repentance,  and  received  from  them 
confession  of  their  sins.  Thus  also  did  S.  Francis  Xavier,  who 
sailed  throughout  the  East,  and  won  converts  as  much  by  his  life 
as  by  his  preaching. 

Ver.  40. — But  Martha  was  cumbered  with  much  serving , w$g/ie* Stn 
njJ  <roXX^r  dsaxotlai,  was  drawn  aside  and  distracted,  ie.  was  anxious 
that  nothing  should  be  wanting  for  the  entertainment  of  such  a 
guest.  Hence  the  Arabic,  Martha  was  diligently  serving  to  the 
utmost  of  her  power. 

And  came  to  Himt  and  said \ Lord , dost  Thou  not  care  that  my  sister

hath  left  me  to  serve  alone  t bid  her  therefore  that  she  help  me.  Came 
to  Him  : Greek,  ivier&ea,  standing  by  Him. 

Dost  Thou  not  caret  Does  not  it  displease  you  ? Arabic. 

Martha  spoke  thus  partly  from  her  wish  that  all  things  should  be 
properly  prepared  for  Christ,  partly  from  her  knowledge  of  His 
consideration  and  kindness.  Lord,  my  sister  sees  me  overwhelmed 
with  care  because  of  my  desire  to  honour  Thee,  and  yet  does 
nothing  to  assist  me.  Out  of  kindness  to  me,  bid  her,  therefore, 
share  my  labour.  She  will  obey  Thy  word,  but  will  not,  I know, 
listen  to  my  request. 

Ver.  41. — And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  her , Martha , Martha, 
thou  art  careful  and  troubled  about  many  things.  The  repetition  of 
her  name,  says  S.  Augustin,  “ is  a sign  of  affection,  or  perhaps  of  a 
desire  to  arrest  her  attention  more  particularly  to  what  He  was  about 
to  say.  For  she  was  so  entirely  engrossed  by  her  household  cares, 
that  His  words  might  have  been  unheeded  had  she  not  been 
specially  addressed  by  name.’1  S.  Augustin  adds,  “ Mary  made 
no  reply,  because  she  preferred  to  commit  her  cause  to  her  Judge, 
and  knew  that  Christ  would,  as  He  was  wont,  stand  by  her  and 
support  her.  Hence  Christ,  who  was  appealed  to  as  Judge,  became 
her  Advocate.”  Interlinear  Gloss. 

Thou  art  too  anxious,  Martha,  and  therefore  thou  are  troubled. 
Thou  desirest  to  prepare  many  things  for  me,  whereas  I need  but 
few.  Emmanuel  Sa  and  all  the  others  translate  rugfiafy,  thou  art 
confused,  but  the  better  rendering  is,  thou  art  troubled.  For  those 
who  are  anxious  about  many  things  experience  much  perturbation 
of  mind — hence  too  much  care  and  anxiety  is  the  sign  of  excessive 
love  or  fear,  and  so  they  who  love  honour  or  riches,  or  any  other 
thing  too  much,  fear  lest  they  may  lose  what  they  love,  and  become 
perturbed  and  anxious. 

Ver.  42. — But  one  thmg  is  needful.  The  Greek  has  M iern 
Igiia ; and  this  “ one  thing  ” Christ  places  in  opposition  to  the  “ many 
things  ” about  which  Martha  was  troubled. 

What  then  is  this  one  thing  which  is  needful  ? Luther,  Bullinger, 
Melancthon,  and  other  like  innovators  answer,  Faith,  i,e,  to  hear

the  Gospel  and  to  believe  in  it.  For  this  is  what  the  Magdalene 
did.  Hence  they  think  that  faith  only  is  necessary  for  salvation. 
Only  believe,  they  say,  that  you  are  saved  through  the  merits  of 
Christ,  and  you  will  assuredly  obtain  your  salvation.  But  such  a 
faith  is  rash  and  delusive.  For  blasphemers  and  evildoers  might 
possess  it.  Hence,  in  addition  to  faith,  hope,  charity,  and  good 
works  are  necessary  for  salvation,  as  is  clear  from  S.  Matt  xix.  17, 
1 Cor.  xiii,  and  Holy  Scripture  generally,  and  from  the  example  of 
the  Magdalene  herself,  who  not  only  heard,  but  was  obedient  to 
the  word  of  the  Lord.  See  S.  Luke  vii.  43. 

The  truer  and  more  orthodox  interpretation  seems  to  be  that  of 
those  who  understand  by  “one  thing”  one  kind  of  food.  Thou 
art  anxious,  Martha,  to  place  before  me  many  dishes,  but  to  no 
purpose,  for  I require  but  one.  I want  not  a rich  banquet,  but  only 
ordinary  food,  for  I am  temperate,  and  a lover  of  humble  fare.  I 
do  not  blame,  but  praise  your  desire  to  do  Me  honour,  yet  I warn 
you  not  to  be  over  careful  for  the  things  of  this  life,  nor  to  call  your 
sister  away  from  hearing  My  words.  So  Theophylact,  S.  Gregory, 
and  others. 

Hear  also  S.  Basil : “ There  is  need  of  few  things,  or  rather  of  but 
one.  Of  few  things  as  far  as  preparations  are  concerned,  but  of  one 
object  for  the  supply  of  our  need ; ” and  Titus,  “ We  came  not  hither 
to  fill  ourselves  with  superfluous  food,  for  nature  is  content  with 
little.”  Similarly  Theophylact  says,  “ One  thing  is  needful : we  must 
eat  something,  but  we  need  not  varieties  of  food,”  i.e.  according  to 
the  Arabic  version,  “That  which  is  necessary  for  us  we  can  easily 
obtain.” 

2.  But  in  a higher  sense,  the  one  thing  needful  is  the  love  of 
God,  and  the  desire  of  salvation.  This  was  the  good  part  which 
Mary  had  chosen ; and  therefore,  explaining  the  one  thing  needful, 
Christ  goes  on  to  say,  “ Mary  hath  chosen  that  good  part  which 
shall  not  be  taken  away  from  her.” 

The  meaning  is,  therefore,  this:  Thou,  Martha,  art  troubled 
about  many  things,  but  I exhort  thee  to  devote  thyself  to  one  thing 
alone,  to  seek  to  please  God,  and  Him  only,  in  every  action  of  thy

life,  and  to  do  everything  out  of  love  towards  Him.  So,  not 
attempting  that  which  thou  art  unable  to  perform,  thou  wilt  be 
enabled  to  serve  Clod  quietly  and  without  fear,  and  to  accomplish 
whatsoever  He  would  have  thee  to  do.  Bede,  Euthymius,  and  others. 

Hence  S.  Augustine  and  S.  Gregory  say,  “ This  one  thing  is  the 
end  and  chief  good  of  men,  on  which  their  minds  should  be  ever 
fixed and  Cassian  says,  “The  one  thing  needful  is  a mind  which, 
regardless  of  all  else,  is  fixed  on  God  alone,  and  rejoices  in  the 
contemplation  of  His  perfections.”  For  although  divine  contem- 
plation is  not  necessary  for  salvation  it  is  necessary  for  the  per- 
fection of  those  who  are  united  to  God  by  a holy  life.  So  the 
Psalmist  says,  Ps.  xxvil  4,  “ One  thing  have  I desired  of  the  Lord, 
that  will  I seek  after ; that  I may  dwell  in  the  house  of  the  Lord 
all  the  days  of  my  life.”  And  S.  Paul,  Phil  iii.  13,  14,  “One  thing 
I do,  forgetting  those  things  which  are  behind,  and  reaching  forth 
unto  those  things  which  are  before,  I press  toward  the  mark  for 
the  prize  of  the  high  calling  of  God  in  Christ  Jesus.”  And  again, 
Esther  xiv.  18,  “Thine  handmaid  hath  never  rejoiced  since  I was 
brought  hither,  unto  this  day,  but  in  thee,  O Lord,  the  God  of  Abra- 
ham.”— Douay.  For  Christ  saith,  S.  John  xvii.  3,  “This  is  life 
eternal,  that  they  might  know  Thee  the  only  true  God,  and  Jesus 
Christ  whom  Thou  hast  sent” 

Wherefore,  when  S.  ^Egidius,  a very  holy  man,  one  of  the  first 
followers  of  S.  Francis,  was  asked  the  way  to  holiness  and  perfection, 
he  answered,  “ Una  uni.”  Let  your  whole  mind  be  entirely  given 
up  to  God,  and  one  with  Him.  For  unity  is  contrary  to  division, 
and  God  is  one.  Wherefore  let  him  who  seeks  God  return  to  unity 
with  Him,  for  God  must  be  sought  by  conformity  of  will,  and  by  the 
union  of  the  intellect  and  affections.  S.  Bernard  (serm.  7 in  Cant.) 

Hence  S.  Augustine  (lib.  n,  18  De  Ordine.)  proves  by  induction 
that  all  things  tend  to  one,  because,  as  he  shows,  “Unity  or  single- 
ness is  the  first  fruit  of  God,  who  is  the  first  essential  and  uncreated 
unity,  the  origin  and  fount  of  all  other  unities ; ” and  in  a later  chapter 
he  dwells  upon  the  beauty  of  unity. 

In  short,  the  one  thing  needful  is  God.  All  other  things  con*

tingent  and  immaterial,  created  by  the  good  pleasure  of  God  out  of 
nothing ; and  as,  to  quote  the  proverb,  he  who  pursues  two  hares 
catches  neither,  so  he  who  strives  to  please  God  and  the  world 
fails  to  attain  either  object 

Figuratively , this  “one  thing”  is  to  be  acquired  by  meditation 
and  prayer,  for  thus  men  are  brought  into  communion  with  God. 
Hence  he  who  would  lead  a religious  life  should  seek  this  one 
thing  only,  so  as  to  be  thereby  drawn  into  union  with  the  Almighty. 
S.  Dionysius  and  Climacus.  “ A monk  is  one  who  always  has  his 
soul  lifted  up  to  God ; one  who  prays  at  all  times,  at  all  places, 
and  on  all  occasions ; ” and  S.  Chrysostom  says,  “ Prayer  is  the  heart 
and  soul  of  a perfect  and  religious  life ; ” and  S.  Bonaventura  (Ve 
perfection  vitae,  chap . 5),  declares  that  “ If  any  one  who  has  taken 
the  vows  of  a religious  life  omits  frequent  prayer,  his  soul  is  dead 
within  him,  or  in  other  words  he  is  like  a body  without  a soul, 
having  the  outward  form  and  religion,  but  lacking  its  inward  grace.” 
And  again,  “Without  abundant  prayer  religion  becomes  languid  and 
weak.  Why,  unhappy  spirit,  dost  thou  wander  through  many  places, 
seeking  rest  and  finding  none?  Set  thy  affections  on  Him,  of 
whom  are  all  things,  and  in  Him  thou  wilt  rest  happy  and  content 
For  He  will  satisfy  thee  with  good  things,  and  give  thee  to  drink  out 
of  His  pleasures  as  out  of  a river.” 

Hear  also  what  Epictetus  says  to  Arrian:  “All  first  principles 
must,  as  if  the  world  were  turned  upside  down,  return  to  one — all 
beauty,  truth,  and  everything  which  is  good,  to  one  origin — every- 
thing divine  to  one  God,  all  unity  to  the  Triune.”  For  unity,  the 
beginning  of  things,  goodness,  truth  and  God  are  the  same,  and 
therefore  one.  Hence  we  read,  Cant  ii.  16,  “ My  beloved  to  me, 
and  I to  Him,”  for  the  Bride  makes  entire  surrender  of  herself  to 
her  spouse ; and  so  the  saints  desire  to  put  off  the  flesh,  that  their 
souls  may  be  united  with  God.  So  S.  Paul  was  willing  rather  to  be 
absent  from  the  body,  and  to  be  present  with  the  Lord  (2  Cor.  v.  8) ; 
and  Simeon,  “ Lord,  now  lettest  Thou  thy  servant  depart  in  peace 
according  to  thy  word ; ” and  the  Psalmist,  “ Woe  is  me,  that  I am 
constrained  to  dwell  with  Mesech.”  Ps.  cxx.  5.

S.  LUKE,  c.  X. 


S.  Basil  speaks  of  some  who  abhorred  this  life,  as  if  it  were  a 
dark  prison,  and  with  difficulty  restrained  their  desire  (o*yot?c)  for 
release,  because  their  hearts  were  filled  with  the  love  of  God,  and 
eager  to  gaze  upon  the  divine  perfections : they  longed  for  the  time 
when  they  might  for  ever  contemplate  the  loving-kindness  of  the 
Lord. 

So  this  blessed  rest  is  to  the  wise  a time  of  working,  and  the  mind 
which  has  once  been  absorbed  in  the  contemplation  of  the  divinity, 
sustains  itself  on  God  and  is  sustained  by  Him. 

Wherefore  David  says,  Ps.  xlii.  2,  “ My  soul  thirsteth  for  God, 
for  the  living  God ; when  shall  I come  and  appear  before  God  ?” 

Symbolically , unity  is  the  beginning  and  end  of  all  numbers,  for 
every  number  commences  and  ends  in  it — whilst  it  is  independent 
and  indivisible. 

So  God  is  the  beginning  and  ending  of  all  things,  the  Alpha  and 
Omega  (Rev.  xxl  6),  who  shutteth  and  openeth  all  things,  before 
whom  and  after  whom  there  is  nothing.  Who  was  from  all  eternity, 
through  whom  and  by  whom  all  things  exist.  Hence  Plato  says, 
“ All  things  spring  from  the  divine  unity,  and  retain  the  trace  of 
their  origin,  by  means  of  which  they  are  recalled  to  this  unity,  and 
perfected  in  it  ;*  and  considers  unity  to  be  God,  in  whom  all  things 
exist  as  branches  from  the  root 

Again,  where  sin  is  there  is  division ; but  where  virtue,  there  one- 
ness— where  love,  there  unity.  Therefore  let  him  who  seeks  after 
virtue  love  one  thing,  and  seek  also  for  unity.  For  Christ,  the  teacher 
of  unity,  wills  to  join  us  together  in  one  Church  and  unite  us  to 
Himself. 

For  unity  imparts  holiness  to  the  mind,  health  to  the  body,  peace 
and  concord  to  countries  and  households,  in  short,  all  the  virtue  and 
strength  of  a nation  arises  out  of  its  oneness  with  itself  But  divi- 
sion is  the  cause  of  discord,  schism,  war,  and  countless  ills.  Hence 
Plato  (Dc  Repub . lib . v.)  says,  The  worst  evil  which  can  befall  a state 
is  division,  and  its  highest  good  subjection,  if  subjection  makes  it 
again  one. 

Hence  S.  Augustine  says  of  the  heavenly  life,  “There  will  be

there  no  grudging  because  rof  unequal  love,  for  one  love  will  reign 
supreme  in  all;91  and  S.  Gregory,  “So  great  a love  there  unites  all, 
that  each  rejoices  that  another  rather  than  himself  has  received  a 
blessing."  Life  therefore  reigns  in  love,  ue.  in  union ; but  death  in 
hatred,  ue.  in  division. 

Mary  hath  chosen  that  good  part.  The  Syriac  and  Arabic  add 
“to  herself" — hath  taken  to  herself  The  Greek  word  ayahit 
implies  excellence,  hence  the  Vulgate  gives  optimam.  For  Christ 
commends  the  one  sister  more  than  the  other.  “ Thou,  Martha,  hast 
chosen  well,  but  Mary  better.  Thou  hast  not  chosen  a bad  part, 
but  she  a better."  S.  Augustine.  “ Behold,  Martha  is  not  blamed, 
but  Mary  is  praised."  Bede.  And  again,  S.  Augustin  (serm.  27  De 
Verbis  Domini ),  “Can  we  imagine  that  Martha  was  blamed  for 
being  intent  on  hospitable  cares?  How  could  she  be  rightly 
blamed  for  rejoicing  over  such  a guest?"  So  also  Ambrose  and 
Cassian  (Coll at.  i.,  chap.  8). 

Theophylact  explains,  “By  the  action  of  the  one,  the  body  is 
nourished ; by  the  action  of  the  other  the  soul  receives  life."  And 
Euthymius,  “ It  is  good  to  be  hospitable,  but  it  is  better  to  hear  the 
word  of  God,  for  the  one  is  of  the  body,  the  other  of  the  spirit” 

S.  Augustin  gives  another  figurative  interpretation:  “Why  was 
Mary's  the  better  part?  Because  she  preferred  the  one  thing  to 
many.  Many  things  were  created,  but  there  was  but  one  Creator, 
and  if  the  things  created  were  very  good,  how  excellent  must  He 
be  who  created  them." 

There  are  three  persons  in  the  Godhead,  and  these  three  are  one, 
so  the  nearer  you  approach  to  perfect  unity,  the  nigher  you  draw  to 
God;  and  Christ  Himself  prays  the  Father  that  His  disciples  “may 
be  one,  as  Thou,  Father,  art  in  Me,  and  I in  Thee,  that  they  also 
may  be  one  in  Us.”  And  again,  “The  glory  which  thou  gavest  Me 
have  I given  them ; that  they  may  be  one,  even  as  We  are  one." 
See  S.  John  xviL  21  et  seq. 

Hence  to  choose  the  good  part,  is  to  give  up  all  care  of  earthly 
things,  and  to  devote  oneself  entirely  to  the  service  of  God. 

Hear  Richard  de  S.  Victor  on  Cant  viii : “ Mary  chose  the  better

part,  because  she  saw  that  the  contemplation  and  the  love  of  God 
included  all  things ; but  her  sister  was  occupied  about  things  which, 
though  many,  are  limited  to  this  world : hence  by  comparison  Martha 
was  troubled  about  few  things.  But  the  one  thing  necessary,  and 
to  be  preferred  before  all,  is  to  love  God  with  the  whole  heart,  and 
to  show  love  and  charity  to  all  men.”  And  Suarez  (De  Oratione 
Mentali ) says,  “Mary  made  the  better  choice,  because  mental 
prayer  brings  about  blessedness  in  this  life,  because  it  is  the  com- 
mencement of  that  beatific  vision  which  will  be  the  happiness  of 
the  saints  in  heaven.” 

Hence  the  joy  of  Magdalene  was  real  and  lasting.  So  S. 
Bernard  says,  “It  is  impossible  to  enjoy  here  on  earth  a sweet 
and  happy  life,  since  the  earth  itself  is  subject  to  constant  change ; 
but  there  is  a joy  lasting  in  its  happiness,  which  arises  out  of  a 
pure  conscience.  For  the  mind  which  is  purified  from  earthly 
affections  and  entirely  fixed  on  the  contemplation  of  heavenly 
things,  fears  no  threatenings,  knows  no  fear,  conceives  no  false 
hopes,  but,  void  of  all  offence,  rests  in  perfect  peace.”  Hugo 
Victorious  accounts  for  this  perfect  peace  thus : “ A conscience  is 
quiet  and  void  of  offence  when  it  is  kindly  affectioned  to  all,  and 
bears  ill-will  to  none : when  it  regards  a friend  with  kindness,  an 
enemy  with  patience,  and  seeks  to  do  good,  if  possible,  to  all  men.” 

Allusion  is  here  made,  says  Maldonatus,  to  the  manner  in  which 
the  ancients  divided  an  inheritance.  It  was  customary  for  the  eldest 
son  to  divide  the  property  into  as  many  parts  as  might  be  requisite, 
and  for  his  brothers  to  have  the  first  choice,  so  as  to  ensure  an 
equal  division.  Seneca  (lib.  vi,  Dcdamatio  3). 

Thus  Christ  was  the  inheritance,  which  Martha  as  the  elder  sister 
divided  into  two  parts,  to  hear  Christ  and  to  serve  Him.  Mary  the 
younger  chose  the  better  part,  ue.  to  hear  the  words  of  Christ,  for 
the  Hebrew  (p^n),  chelec,  i.e.  part,  in  Scripture  signifies  the  lot  of 
one’s  inheritance.  Thus,  “ The  Lord  is  my  portion,”  Lam.  iil  4. 
See  also  Psalm  xvl  5. 

But  the  active  and  the  contemplative  life  combined  tend  to  per- 
fection,  for  the  one  controls  and  directs  the  other.  So  Christ  taught

the  people  by  day,  but  was  wont  to  spend  whole  nights  in  prayer,  and 
following  his  example  thus  did  also  the  Baptist  and  the  Apostles. 

Which  shall  not  bo  taken  away  from  her.  Because  to  hear,  like 
Mary,  the  word  of  God,  and  to  meditate  thereon,  is  spiritual  food 
which  will  support  the  soul  until  it  comes  to  appear  in  the  eternal 
presence ; but  to  minister,  as  Martha,  is  to  choose  that  part  which 
endures  but  for  this  present  life.  S.  Augustin  and  others.  Hence 
S.  Gregory : “ The  part  which  Mary  chose  will  never  be  taken 
away  from  her,  because  a contemplative  life  is  unlike  an  active  life, 
its  joys  gain  strength  from  death.” 

Hear  also  S.  Augustin : “ That  which  thou  hast  chosen,  Martha, 
will  be  taken  from  thee,  that  something  better  may  be  given.  For 
in  place  of  labour  thou  shalt  have  rest  Thou  hast  not  yet  reached 
thy  journey's  end,  but  thy  sister  is  in  the  haven.”  And  a little 
before  he  says,  “ Martha  was  troubled  how  she  might  feed  the  Lord, 
Mary  anxious  to  be  fed  by  Him.”  And  again,  “ Carefulness  for 
many  things  passes  away,  but  the  love  of  one  thing  lasts  for  ever.” 
And  Laurentius  Justinianus  says,  “ An  active  life  is  an  anxious  one, 
but  a life  of  contemplation  possesses  a lasting  joy.  The  one  obtains 
a kingdom,  while  the  other  perceives  only.  In  the  one  the  world 
is  despised,  in  the  other  God  will  be  manifest,  for  ‘ My  people  shall 
dwell  in  a peaceable  habitation,  and  in  sure  dwellings,  and  in  quiet 
resting-places. 1 ” Isaiah  xxxii.  18. 

Again  S.  Gregory  writes,  “ The  active  life  ends  with  this  world ; 
for  in  the  next  who  can  give  bread  to  the  hungry  where  there  is  no 
hunger— or  drink  to  the  thirsty  where  there  is  no  thirst  But  the 
contemplative  life  begins  here  on  earth,  to  be  perfected  in  heaven ; 
for  the  fire  of  divine  love  which  is  kindled  here,  bums  brighter  in 
the  presence  of  God,  who  is  its  object” 

See  also  Cassian,  who  says  amongst  other  things,  “ In  the  future 
world  all  will  pass  from  the  many  distractions  of  life  and  from 
actual  work,  to  be  absorbed  in  the  love  of  God  and  in  the  contem- 
plation of  the  Deity.” 

Observe,  as  against  Calvin,  that  Martha  is  the  type  of  the 
active  life,  and  that  Mary,  sitting  silently  at  Jesus'  feet,  insensible

to  what  was  going  on  around  because  of  her  rapt  attention  to  the 
words  of  Christ,  a type  of  the  contemplative.  S.  Bernard  and 
others. 

But  what  is  contemplation  ? S.  Augustin  (or  whoever  else  may 
be  the  author  of  the  treatise  De  Spiritu  et  Ammo)  answers,  “ It  is 
the  joyful  admiration  of  a manifest  truth."  But  S.  Bernard  defines 
contemplation  as  “ the  uplifting  of  the  mind  to  God,  whereby  we 
gain  a forestate  of  the  joys  of  happiness  eternal"  Others  again 
say,  “ It  is  the  sure  intuition  of  the  soul  or  its  undoubted  apprehen- 
sion of  the  truth."  But  Gerson,  following  Hugo,  says,  “ It  is  to  be 
dead  to  all  carnal  desires,  and  to  taste  how  sweet  the  Lord  is.  As 
David  rejoiced  in  the  living  God  (Ps.  lxxxiv.  9),  and  declared  God 
to  be  his  portion  for  ever."  Ps.  lxxiii.  25. 

S.  Gregory  also  (hom.  14  in  Ezck.)  thus  describes  the  duties  of  each 
kind  of  life : — “ The  active  life  consists  in  giving  bread  to  the  hungry, 
in  teaching  the  ignorant,  reclaiming  those  who  are  in  error,  caring 
for  the  sick,  and  in  ministering  to  the  necessities  of  all,  specially  to 
the  necessities  of  those  committed  to  our  trust  But  he  who  would 
lead  a life  of  contemplation  must  ever  keep  in  mind  the  love  of  God 
and  of  his  neighbour,  and  refraining  from  acting  on  this  love,  look 
with  the  longing  expectation  of  a heart  wholly  fixed  on  heaven  for 
the  glory  which  shall  be  revealed." 

Hence  S.  Thomas  says,  “The  contemplative  life,  although 
mainly  intellectual,  originates  in  the  affections,  inasmuch  as  it  springs 
out  of  the  love  of  God,  and  the  end  of  such  a life  is  like  the  begin- 
ning, for  delight  at  the  sight  of  that  which  we  love  increases  our 
love  for  it" 

The  contemplative  life  therefore  causes  a man  to  rise  superior  to 
the  world,  its  trials  and  temptations,  and  to  count  all  things  as 
valueless  in  comparison  with  God,  and  gives  perfect  peace,  because, 
S.  Bernard  says,  “ God  wrapt  all  things  in  a holy  calm,  and  to  gaze 
on  Him  is  to  be  at  rest"  But  this  life  of  contemplation  is  preceded 
by  an  active  life  of  mortification  and  self-denial,  for  as  the  fruit 
follows  after  the  flower,  so  from  a monk  does  a man  become  a hermit 
Therefore  S.  Basil  and  other  ascetics  say  that  the  monastic  life  is  a

fitting  preparation  for  that  life  of  contemplation  to  which  the 
hermits  are  devoted. 

And  so  the  Church  has  rightly  appointed  this  portion  of  scrip- 
ture to  be  read  on  the  Feast  of  the  Assumption  of  the  Blessed 
Virgin  because  she  rendered  to  Christ  the  service  both  of  Martha 
and  of  Mary,  and  chose  that  good  part,  of  which  she  will  never  be 
deprived.

CHAPTER  XI. 

I  Christ  teacheth  to  pray , and  that  instantly.  1 1 Assuring  that  God  so  will  give 
us  good  things.  14  Hey  casting  out  a dumb  devil \ rebuketh  the  blasphemous 
Pharisees . 28  And  shrweth  who  are  blessed . 29  Preacheth  to  the  people , 37 
and  reprehendeth  the  outward  shew  of  holiness  in  the  Pharisees , scribes , and 
lawyers. 

AND  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  he  was  praying  in  a certain  place,  when  he 
ceased,  one  of  his  disciples  said  unto  him,  Lord,  teach  us  to  pray,  as  John 
also  taught  his  disciples. 

2  And  he  said  unto  them,  When  ye  pray,  say,  Our  Father  which  art  in  heaven, 
Hallowed  be  thy  name.  Thy  kingdom  come.  Thy  will  be  done,  as  in  heaven, 
so  in  earth. 

3  Give  us  day  by  day  our  daily  bread. 

4  And  forgive  us  our  sins  ; for  we  also  forgive  every  one  that  is  indebted  to  us. 
And  lead  us  not  into  temptation ; but  deliver  us  from  evil. 

5  And  he  said  unto  them.  Which  of  you  shall  have  a friend,  and  shall  go  unto 
him  at  midnight,  and  say  unto  him,  Friend,  lend  me  three  loaves ; 

6  For  a friend  of  mine  in  his  journey  is  come  to  me,  and  I have  nothing  to  set 
before  him  ? 

7  And  he  from  within  shall  answer  and  say,  Trouble  me  not : the  door  is  now 
shut,  and  my  children  are  with  me  in  bed  ; I cannot  rise  and  give  thee. 

8  I say  unto  you.  Though  he  will  not  rise  and  give  him,  because  he  is  his 
friend,  yet  because  of  his  importunity  he  will  rise  and  give  him  as  many  as  he 
needeth. 

9  And  I say  unto  you,  Ask,  and  it  shall  be  given  you  ; seek,  and  ye  shall  find  ; 
knock,  and  it  shall  be  opened  unto  you. 

10  For  every  one  that  asketh  receiveth ; and  he  that  seeketh  findeth ; and  to 
him  that  knocketh  it  shall  be  opened. 

II  If  a son  shall  ask  bread  of  any  of  you  that  is  a father,  will  he  give  him  a 
stone  ? or  if  he  ash  a fish,  will  he  for  a fish  give  him  a serpent  ? 

12  Or  if  he  shall  ask  an  egg,  will  he  offer  him  a scorpion  ? 

13  If  ye  then,  being  evil,  know  how  to  give  good  gifts  unto  your  children  : how 
much  more  shall  your  heavenly  Father  give  the  Holy  Spirit  to  them  that  ask  him? 

14  And  he  was  casting  out  a devil,  and  it  was  dumb.  And  it  came  to  pass, 
when  the  devil  was  gone  out,  the  dumb  spake ; and  the  people  wondered. 

15  But  some  of  them  said,  He  casteth  out  devils  through  Beelzebub  the  chief 
of  the  devils. 

16  And  others,  tempting  him9  sought  of  him  a sign  from  heaven. 

17  But  be,  knowing  their  thoughts,  said  unto  them,  Every  kingdom  divided

against  itself  is  brought  to  desolation ; and  a house  divided  against  a house 
falleth. 

18  If  Satan  also  be  divided  against  himself,  how  shall  his  kingdom  stand? 
because  ye  say  that  I cast  out  devils  through  Beelzebub. 

19  And  if  I by  Beelzebub  cast  out  devils,  by  whom  do  your  sons  cast  them  out  ? 
therefore  shall  they  be  your  judges. 

90  But  if  I with  the  finger  of  God  cast  out  devils,  no  doubt  the  kingdom  of  God 
is  come  upon  you. 

21  When  a strong  man  armed  keepeth  his  palace,  his  goods  are  in  peace  : 

22  But  when  a stronger  than  he  shall  come  upon  him,  and  overcome  him,  he' 
taketh  from  him  all  his  armour  wherein  he  trusted,  and  divideth  his  spoils. 

23  He  that  is  not  with  me  is  against  me  : and  he  that  gathereth  not  with  me 
scattereth. 

24  When  the  unclean  spirit  is  gone  out  of  a man,  he  walketh  through  dry  places, 
seeking  rest ; and  finding  none,  he  saith,  I will  return  into  my  house  whence  I 
came  out 

25  And  when  he  cometh,  he  findeth  it  swept  and  garnished. 

26  Then  goeth  he,  and  taketh  to  him  seven  other  spirits  more  wicked  than  him- 
self; and  they  enter  in,  and  dwell  there : and  the  last  state  of  that  man  is  worse 
than  the  first 

27  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  spake  these  things,  a certain  woman  of  the  com- 
pany lifted  up  her  voice,  and  said  unto  him,  Blessed  is  the  womb  that  bare  thee, 
and  the  paps  which  thou  hast  sucked. 

28  But  he  said,  Yea  rather,  blessed  are  they  that  hear  the  word  of  God,  and 
keep  it. 

29  And  when  the  people  were  gathered  thick  together,  he  began  to  say,  This 
is  an  evil  generation  : they  seek  a sign  ; and  there  shall  no  sign  be  given  it,  but 
the  sign  of  Jonas  the  prophet 

30  For  as  Jonas  was  a sign  unto  the  Ninevites,  so  shall  also  the  Son  of  man  be 
to  this  generation. 

31  The  queen  of  the  south  shall  rise  up  in  the  judgment  with  the  men  of  this 
generation,  and  condemn  them  : for  she  came  from  the  utmost  parts  of  the  earth 
to  hear  the  wisdom  of  Solomon  ; and,  behold,  a greater  than  Solomon  is  here. 

32  The  men  of  Nineve  shall  rise  up  in  the  judgment  with  this  generation,  and 
shall  condemn  it : for  they  repented  at  the  preaching  of  Jonas ; and,  behold,  a 
greater  than  Jonas  is  here. 

33  No  man,  when  he  hath  lighted  a candle,  putteth  it  in  a secret  place,  neither 
under  a bushel,  but  on  a candlestick,  that  they  which  come  in  may  see  the  light. 

34  The  light  of  the  body  is  the  eye : therefore  when  thine  eye  is  single,  thy 
whole  body  also  is  full  of  light ; but  when  thine  eye  is  evil,  thy  body  also  is  full  of 
darkness. 

35  Take  heed  therefore  that  the  light  which  is  in  thee  be  not  darkness. 

36  If  thy  whole  body  therefore  be  full  of  light,  having  no  part  dark,  the  whole 
shall  be  full  of  light,  as  when  the  bright  shining  of  a candle  doth  give  thee  light 

37  And  as  he  spake,  a certain  Pharisee  besought  him  to  dine  with  him  : and 
he  went  in,  and  sat  down  to  meat. 

38  And  when  the  Pharisee  saw  it,  he  marvelled  that  he  had  not  first  washed 
before  dinner.

39  And  the  Lord  said  unto  him,  Now  do  ye  Pharisees  make  clean  the  outside  of 
the  cup  and  the  platter ; but  your  inward  part  is  full  of  ravening  and  wickedness. 

40  Ye  fools,  did  not  he  that  made  that  which  is  without  make  that  which  is 
within  also  ? 

41  But  rather  give  alms  of  such  things  as  ye  have ; and,  behold,  all  things  are 
clean  unto  you. 

42  But  woe  unto  you,  Pharisees ! for  ye  tithe  mint  and  rue  and  all  manner  of 
herbs,  and  pass  over  judgment  and  the  love  of  God : these  ought  ye  to  have  done, 
and  not  to  leave  the  other  undone. 

43  Woe  unto  you,  Pharisees ! for  ye  love  the  uppermost  seats  in  the  synagogues, 
and  greetings  in  the  markets. 

44  Woe  unto  you,  scribes  and  Pharisees,  hypocrites ! for  ye  are  as  graves  which 
appear  not,  and  the  men  that  walk  over  them  are  not  aware  of  them. 

45  Then  answered  one  of  the  lawyers,  and  said  unto  him,  Master,  thus  saying 
thou  reproachest  us  also. 

4 6 And  he  said,  Woe  unto  you  also,  ye  lawyers  ! for  ye  lade  men  with  burdens 
grievous  to  be  borne,  and  ye  yourselves  touch  not  the  burdens  with  one  of  your 
fingers. 

47  Woe  unto  you ! for  ye  build  the  sepulchres  of  the  prophets,  and  your  fathers 
killed  them. 

48  Truly  ye  bear  witness  that  ye  allow  the  deeds  of  your  fathers : for  they  in- 
deed killed  them,  and  ye  build  their  sepulchres. 

49  Therefore  also  said  the  wisdom  of  God,  I will  send  them  prophets  and  apostles, 
and  some  of  them  they  shall  slay  and  persecute  * 

50  That  the  blood  of  all  the  prophets,  which  was  shed  from  the  foundation  of 
the  world,  may  be  required  of  this  generation ; 

51  From  the  blood  of  Abel  unto  the  blood  of  Zacharias,  which  perished  between 
the  altar  and  the  temple : verily  I say  unto  you.  It  shall  be  required  of  this 
generation. 

52  Woe  unto  you,  lawyers  I for  ye  have  taken  away  the  key  of  knowledge ; ye 
entered  not  in  yourselves,  and  them  that  were  entering  in  ye  hindered. 

53  And  as  he  said  these  things  unto  them,  the  scribes  and  the  Pharisees  began 
to  urge  him  vehemently,  and  to  provoke  him  to  speak  of  many  things : 

54  Laying  wait  for  him,  and  seeking  to  catch  something  out  of  his  mouth,  that 
they  might  accuse  him. 

Ver.  2 — When  ye  pray,  say,  Our  Father  which  art  in  heaven,  Hal • 
lowed  be  Thy  name.  & Matthew  adds  this  prayer  to  the  sermon 
on  the  mount,  whilst  S.  Luke  places  it  at  a later  period.  Either, 
therefore,  Christ  taught  His  disciples  this  prayer  on  two  separate 
occasions,  or  S.  Matthew  added  it  to  the  sermon  on  the  mount,  in 
order  to  make  that  sermon  a complete  summary  of  evangelical 
doctrine. 

Here  we  may  observe,  that  S.  Matthew  makes  this  prayer  consist 
of  seven  petitions,  but  S.  Luke  of  five.  The  latter  evangelist  unites

two,  because  they  are  contained  in  the  others.  Hence,  because 
S.  Luke  omits  the  last  petition,  “ deliver  us  from  evil,”  the  Pelagians 
argued  that  although  we  might  pray  against  being  led  into  tempta- 
tion, we  ought  not  to  pray  for  deliverance  from  evil. 

Ver.  5. — And  He  said  unto  them.  Which  of  you  shall  have  a friend, 
and  shall  go  unto  him  at  midnight. 

At  midnight,  Le.  at  a most  inconvenient  time. 

Christ  puts  forth  this  parable  to  teach  His  disciples  not  to  be 
disheartened,  nor  to  cease  to  pray  because  their  petitions  are  un- 
answered, but  to  persevere,  for  if  they  do  this,  God  will  listen  to 
their  prayers  and  grant  them  their  requests. 

Ver.  6. — For  a friend  of  mine  in  his  journey  is  come  to  me,  and  1 
have  nothing  to  set  before  him.  My  friend,  hungry  and  wearied  with 
his  journey,  seeks  refreshment,  and  I have  nothing  to  set  before 
him. 

Ver.  7. — And  he  from  within  shall  answer  and  say.  Trouble  me 
not.  He  makes  excuse  that  he  cannot  wake  his  children  from  their 
sleep  and  disturb  his  household. 

Ver.  8. — 1 say  unto  you.  Though  he  will  not  rise  and  give  him, 
because  he  is  his  friend,  yet  because  of  his  importunity  he  will  rise  and 
give  him  as  many  as  he  needeth. 

Importunity — dmldtiat,  i.e.,  impudence,  used  as  the  Latin  word 
impudens — e.g.,  labor  impudens  (i.e.  unceasing  labour)  omnia  vindt 

Here  S.  Augustine  asks,  “Why  because  of  his  importunity? 
Because  he  continued  to  knock  and  did  not  go  away  because  his 
request  was  denied  him.  He  who  was  unwilling  to  give  what  his 
friend  had  need  of,  gave  at  last  because  the  other  continued  his 
demands.  Much  more  then  will  God  who  in  His  goodness  bids  us 
make  known  our  requests  to  Him,  and  is  displeased  with  those  who 
seek  Him  not,  grant  our  requests.” 

God  wills  that  we  should  continue  instant  in  prayer,  and  is  pleased 
with  our  “importunity,”  for  persistent  prayer  is  “violence  pleasing 
to  God.”  Tertullian. 

Ver.  9. — And  1 say  unto  you,  ask  and  it  shall  be  given  you.  (See 
S.  Matt.  vii.  7.)

Ver.  12. — Or  if  he  shall  ask  an  egg . This  verse  is  omitted  by 
S.  Matthew.  An  egg,  because  of  the  nourishment  it  contains. 

Ver.  27. — And  it  came  to  pass  as  He  spake  these  things , a certain 
woman  of  the  company  lifted  up  her  voice , and  said  unto  him>  &c.,  i.e. 
Thou  art  so  holy  and  so  blessed,  O Christ,  that  because  of  thee 
thy  mother  must  be  also  blessed.  Although  she  was  ignorant  of  the 
mystery,  this  woman  was  moved  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  declare  that 
Christ  was  bom  of  a virgin  mother.  Some  suppose  that  the  woman 
here  mentioned  was  S.  Martha  or  her  handmaid  S.  Marcella.  How- 
ever, had  it  been  Martha,  in  all  probability  S.  Luke  would  have  said 
so,  since  he  so  frequently  in  the  chapter  preceding  makes  mention 
of  her  name. 

But  Marcella  is  said  to  have  incurred  the  enmity  of  the  Scribes 
because  she  thus  openly  spoke  in  praise  of  Christ,  and  to  have  been 
by  them  condemned  to  death  a little  after  the  crucifixion,  and  there 
is  a tradition  that,  together  with  Martha,  Mary  Magdalene,  and 
Lazarus,  she  was  exposed  in  an  open  boat  without  sails  or  oars, 
but  that  it  with  its  living  freight  was  by  the  providence  of  God 
brought  safe  to  shore  at  Marseilles. 

Blessed  is  the  womb  that  bare  thee.  For  it  was  the  abiding  place  of 
the  Son  of  God.  Hence  Methodius  says  of  the  Blessed  Virgin: 
“ Thou  didst  conceive  Him  who  comprehended  all  things.  Thou  didst 
bear  Him  in  thy  womb  by  whose  word  all  things  are  sustained.  For 
she  is  the  chariot  of  the  true  Solomon,  of  whom  it  is  written, 4 King 
Solomon  made  himself  a chariot  of  the  wood  of  Lebanon.  He  made 
the  pillars  thereof  of  silver,  the  bottom  thereof  of  gold,  the  covering  of 
it  of  purple,  the  midst  thereof  being  paved  with  love.1 " Cant  iii.  9. 

Hence  Gregory  of  Nicomedia  calls  her  “ the  glorious  throne  and 
royal  chariot  on  which  the  Incarnate  Word  was  carried  when  He 
visited  the  earth.  And  S.  Bernard  says,  Ignatius,  in  the  many 
letters  which  he  wrote  to  the  Blessed  Virgin,  addresses  her  as 
“ Christofera,”  which  is  indeed  a noble  title  conveying  with  it  infinite 
honour ; for  to  be  the  servant  of  Christ  is  to  be  a ruler  and  prince, 
and  to  bear  Him  is  to  be  ennobled,  not  burdened.  And  the  same 
writer,  commenting  on  Rev.  xii,  goes  on  to  say,  “ How  great  favour

EXALTATION  OF  THE  BLESSED  VIRGIN.

hast  thou  found  in  the  sight  of  God,  how  very  nigh  hast  thou  been 
brought  to  Him ! He  abides  in  thee,  and  thou  in  Him.  Thou  didst 
provide  Him  a garment,  and  in  turn  thou  are  clothed  upon  by  Him. 
He  received  of  thee  the  garment  of  the  flesh ; He  clothed  thee  with 
the  glory  of  His  majesty.  Thou  didst  clothe  the  sun  with  a cloudy 
covering,  and  thou  thyself  art  encircled  with  its  splendours.” 

Rightly  therefore  may  we  sing  of  the  mother  of  our  Lord : “Thou 
art  the  exaltation  of  Jerusalem.  Thou  art  the  great  glory  of  Israel. 
Blessed  be  thou  of  the  Almighty  Lord  for  evermore,”  Judith  xv.  9. 

Hear  also  the  testimony  of  the  fathers.  Gregory  Nazianzen,  in 
his  tragedy,  “ The  Suffering  Christ  ” writes : — “ O queen,  O mistress 
and  blessing  of  the  human  race ! be  ever  propitious  to  us  mortal 
men : and  be  my  safeguard  wherever  I may  dwell.”  And  S.  Cyril 
(Contra  Nestorium)  says,  “AH  praise  to  thee,  holy  mother  of  God, 
for  thou  art  this  world’s  pearl,  an  evershining  light,  the  crown  of 
virgins,  and  the  sceptre  of  the  faith ; ” and  S.  Chrysostom : “ Hail, 
mother,  the  throne,  the  grace,  the  glory  and  the  support  of  our  Holy 
Church  I ” And  again,  S.  Ephrem  salutes  her  as  “ the  hope  of.  the 
Fathers,  the  glory  of  the  Prophets,  the  praise  of  the  Apostles,  the 
honour  of  the  Martyrs,  the  joy  of  the  Saints,  and  the  light  of  the 
Patriarchs  of  old.” 

Ver.  28. — But  Be  said \ Yea  rather,  blessed  are  they  that  hear  the 
word  of  God , and  keep  it  • Christ  does  not  say  that  His  mother  is  not 
blessed,  as  Calvin  would  have  us  believe,  but  only  that  they  are  more 
blessed  who  hear  the  word  of  God  and  keep  it,  i.e.  fulfil  its  precepts 
Because  to  be  the  mother  of  God  is  a grace  and  free  gift  of  God, 
but  external,  and  therefore  not  of  necessity  acting  upon  the  soul, 
but  to  hear  and  keep  the  word  is  an  internal  grace,  finding  accept 
ance  in  the  sight  of  God.  Again,  to  be  the  mother  of  God  does  not 
absolutely  ensure  everlasting  happiness,  but  to  keep  God’s  word  up 
to  death  has  the  sure  promise  of  eternal  life.  And  further,  to  be 
the  mother  of  God  is,  of  necessity,  the  blessing  of  one  virgin  only, 
but  to  hear  and  keep  the  word  of  God,  a privilege  common  to  all 
believers. 

Christ  therefore  would  encourage  the  woman  who  had  addressed

S.  LUKE,  C.  XI. 


Him.  Thou  callest  My  mother  blessed,  and  sorrowest  that  so  great 
a privilege  has  not  fallen  to  thy  lot,  but  I offer  thee  a better  and 
more  lasting  blessing,  if  thou  wilt  hear  My  word,  and  keep  My  com- 
mandments. For  My  mother  was  blessed  more  because  she  acknow- 
ledged My  divinity  than  because  she  conceived  Me  in  her  womb, 
nay  more,  because,  had  she  not  recognised  the  purpose  of  God  and 
been  obedient  unto  His  word,  she  would  have  been  accounted 
unworthy  to  have  become  the  mother  of  His  Son;  and  so  SL 
Augustine  says,  “ The  near  relationship  of  mother  would  not  have 
profited  Mary  had  she  not  conceived  Christ  in  her  heart  as  well  as 
in  her  womb.  For  she  was  more  blessed  in  her  faith  than  in  her 
conception.” 

Ver.  34. — The  light  of  the  body  is  the  eye.  Figuratively  the  eye 
represents  reason,  intellect,  especially  good  intention — for  what  the 
eye  is  to  the  body,  such  is  reason  or  good  intention  to  the  mind 

When  thine  eye  is  single,  thy  whole  body  also  is  full  of  light, 
ie.  illumined  by  a single,  a clear  and  unclouded  eye. 

Ver.  36. — If  thy  whole  body  therefore  be  full  of  light  . . • the  whole 
shall  be  full  of  light.  Not  the  body,  but  the  whole  man  and  all 
his  faculties  and  powers.  Maldonatus.  But  Toletus  gives  a different 
rendering : “ If  the  eye,  which  is  the  principal  and  most  noble  part 
of  the  body,  is  full  of  light,  then  by  means  of  it  the  whole  body 
will  be  enlightened.”  * 

Ver.  37. — And  as  He  spake , a certain  Pharisee  besought  Him  to 
dine  with  him:  and  He  went  in,  and  sat  down  to  meat.  “As  he 
spake,”  As  He  was  on  a certain  occasion  teaching  the  people,  say 
St  Augustine  and  others ; but  Maldonatus  considers  that  reference 
is  here  made  to  the  preceding  verses.  The  Pharisee  therefore, 
having  heard  what  our  Lord  had  previously  said,  asked  Him,  from 
no  good  motive,  but,  as  we  learn  from  the  two  last  verses  of  the 
chapter,  in  order  to  find  some  accusation  against  Him. 

“ He  sat  down  to  meat,”  without  having  first  washed  His  hands, 
after  the  manner  of  the  Pharisees. 

* Kinwold  and  others  think  that  this  verse,  which  does  not  occur  in  St.  Matthew, 
is  an  interpolation,  and  that  it  really  is  a grammatical  gloss  on  v.  34.

CLEANSING  OF  THE  HEART. 


281 


Ver.  38. — And  whin  the  Pharisee  saw  it,  he  marvelled  that  He  had 
net  first  washed.  For  the  Pharisees  were  accustomed,  before  they 
sat  down  to  meat,  to  wash  not  their  hands  only,  but  their  arms 
as  far  as  the  elbow.  See  St  Matt  xv.  1. 

Ver.  39. — And  the  Lord  said  unto  him.  Now  do  ye  Pharisees 
make  dean  the  outside  of  the  cup  and  platter.  Ye  take  care  to  wash 
the  body,  but  are  careless  as  to  the  cleansing  of  the  heart  The 
word  “ now  ” gives  point  to  the  rebuke. 

Ver.  41. — But  rather  give  alms  of  such  things  as  ye  have;  and% 
behold,  all  things  are  dean  unto  you,  rd  irorro,  quod  superest  Vul- 
gate. These  words  are  omitted  by  many  of  the  fathers,  but 
retained  in  the  Roman  versions. 

By  these  words  we  may  therefore  understand  : 

1.  Such  things  as  we  possess.  So  Tertullian  (lib,  iv.  27  Contra 
Marc,),  But  St.  Basil  and  Euthymius  explain  them  as  meaning 
“what  we  have  in  store,11  or  what  we  have  at  hand,  what  we  have 
not  consumed.  Vatablus.  Others  think  that  the  words  mean 
“what  we  have  not  acquired  wrongfully,  for  such  things  must  be 
restored,  and  not  given  in  charity.”  Others,  again,  such  things  as 
we  have  in  our  power  and  at  our  disposal,  that  by  giving  of  these 
we  may  make  amends  for  our  many  misdeeds,  may  break  off  our 
iniquities,  by  showing  mercy  to  the  poor.  Dan.  iv.  24. 

2.  Toletus  thinks,  from  a consideration  of  v.  39,  that  by  rd  i» 4rra 
we  must  understand  the  things  within.  “Ye,  O Pharisees,  make 
clean  the  outside  of  the  cup  and  platter,  but  your  inward  part  is 
full  of  ravening  and  wickedness,  for  ye  have  obtained  what  ye  eat 
and  what  ye  drink  by  robbery  and  injustice.  Cleanse  yourselves 
therefore  of  your  sins.  Restore  what  you  have  gained  unjustly  and 
give  alms  of  such  things  as  ye  lawfully  possess.”  Thus,  Zaccheus 
said,  “The  half  of  my  goods  I give  to  the  poor,  and  if  I have  taken 
anything  from  any  man  by  false  accusation,  I restore  him  fourfold. 
St  Luke  xix.  8. 

3.  Theophylact  considers  that  our  Lord  here  goes  to  the  root  of 
the  evil,  and  would  have  the  Pharisees  cast  out  of  their  hearts 
rd  ititra,  i.e.  their  inordinate  love  of  riches.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XI. 


4.  But  we  may  interpret  the  passage  more  forcibly  as  meaning, 
There  is  but  one  remedy  for  your  past  sins  and  extortions:  give 
alms ; this  is  a duty  which  comes  before  all  others,  this  is  the  sum 
and  substance  of  the  whole  matter.  Bede. 

5.  Lastly,  some  would  read  the  verse  thus:  Give  alms  of  such 
things  as  you  may  lawfully  dispose  of,  ri  •»*»,  what  is  lawful,  tie.  of 
such  things  as  are  your  own,  and  not  the  property  of  others.  Give 
freely,  and  not  because  you  are  under  any  obligation  to  give. 

And  behold  all  things  are  clean  unto  you.  Some  think  that  these 
words  were  spoken  in  irony ; but  the  general  opinion  of  the  fathers 
is  that  we  must  understand  them  seriously ; but  how — 

1.  Certain  are  of  opinion  that  the  sins  of  robbery  and  violence 
are  pardoned  through  the  giving  of  alms,  even  although  no  previous 
restitution  has  been  made.  But  this  is  a manifest  error,  for  S. 
Augustine  says,  “no  sin  is  remitted,  unless  restitution  is  made,” 
for  restitution  of  that  which  has  been  wrongfully  acquired  is  due 
under  every  law,  natural,  human,  or  divine. 

2.  S.  Augustine  understands  by  “ almsgiving  ” every  good  work, 
including  even  penitence  itself,  for  “ How,”  he  asks,  “can  you  be 
merciful  to  another,  if  you  are  unmerciful  to  yourself?  To  have 
compassion  on  your  own  soul  is  to  be  pleasing  to  God.”  He  there- 
fore who  repents  of  his  sins,  has  compassion  on  his  own  soul ; for 
almsgiving  is  whatever  is  done  by  a profitable  compassion.  To 
“give  alms”  means  “devote  thyself  to  good  works,  to  works  of 
charity  and  of  penitence,  for  these  will  make  you  clean.” 

3.  But  we  may  take  the  words  really  in  this  sense.  “ All  things, 
whether  external,  as  the  body,  or  internal,  as  the  soul,  are  made  clean, 
not  by  ceremonial  washings,  as  ye  think,  but  by  alms  given  out  of 
ret,  f'6ra,  “ that  which  is  thine  own.”  See  preceding  section  5. 

For  by  almsgiving  we  obtain  the  pardon  of  our  venial  offences, 
and  are  placed  in  the  way  of  obtaining  the  remission  of  even  mortal 
sin,  if,  that  is  to  say,  our  almsgiving  is  the  fruit  of  true  contrition 
which  includes  within  itself  the  perfect  love  of  God 

We  must  therefore  understand  that  the  giving  of  alms  makes  all 
things  clean,  if  it  be  accompanied  by  faith,  hope,  contrition,  and

283 


such  other  things  as  are  required  by  scripture  for  the  remission  of  sin, 
and  if  the  almsgiver  does  not  again  return  to  his  evil  ways.  Hence, 
according  to  the  teaching  of  Christ  and  His  apostles,  we  are  saved 
by  faith,  and  that  not  alone,  but  accompanied  by  penitence  and  love. 

Origen,  SS.  Cyprian,  Ambrose  and  others,  explain  that  almsgiving 
is  a remedy  for  every  sin,  but  chiefly  for  extortion  and  robbery 
and  such  sins  as  are  contrary  to  itsel£  For  it  is  a remedy  against 
avarice,  which  is  the  root  of  the  evil  Because  he  who  is  liberal  and 
compassionate  neither  envies,  robs,  nor  wrongs  any  one.  Hence 
Theophylact  calls  almsgiving  “the  daughter  of  godlike  love  and 
charity;"  and  S.  Cyril,  on  Dan.  iv.,  declares  the  giving  of  alms  to  be 
better  than  fasting,  for  that  which  can  be  applied  to  all  wounds  is 
no  valueless  medicament  See  also  S.  Matt.  xxii. 

Ver.  45. — Then  answered  one  of  the  lawyers, , and  said  unto  Him, 
Master,  thus  saying  Thou  reproachest  us  also.  blamest  or 

dishonourest  Thou  accusest  us,  and  that  openly,  of  much  wicked- 
ness. But  Christ  exposed  the  wickedness  of  the  Scribes,  not  to 
disgrace  them,  but  to  lead  them  to  amend  their  lives ; or,  if  that  were 
impossible,  to  prevent  others  from  following  their  evil  example.  So 
S.  Cyril  says,  “ To  be  convicted  of  error  is  to  the  proud  intolerable, 
but  to  the  humble  a great  means  of  advancement"  Bede : “ How 
wretched  is  that  conscience  which  thinks  itself  insulted  whenever  it 
may  happen  to  hear  the  word  of  God."  Yet  even  now  the  wicked, 
when  a preacher  attacks  vices  which  they  are  conscious  of  com- 
mitting, think  themselves  aggrieved  and  persecute  the  man  who 
warns  them  of  their  sin. 

Ver.  47. — Woe  unto  you  l for  ye  build  the  sepulchres  of  the  pro- 
phets. Christ  does  not  rebuke  the  Scribes  for  building  these  sepul- 
chres, but  because  they  sought  to  persecute  and  slay  Him  and  His 
apostles,  who  were  as  the  prophets  of  old.  See  S.  Matt  xxiii.* 

* Although  from  comparing  S.  Matt  xxii.  35  with  S.  Mark  xii.  28  and  S. 
Luke  v.  17,  with  the  21st  Terse  of  the  same  chapter  and  with  S.  Mark  ii.  6, 
the  Scribes  seem  to  be  the  same  as  the  Lawyers,  yet  we  may  assume  that  there 
was  this  difference  between  them  : the  lawyer  was  one  conversant  with  the  law, 
but  the  scribe  one  who  publicly  taught  or  practised  it.

S.  LUKE,  C XI. 


“ Ye  act,  O ye  Scribes,  in  accordance  with  the  example  of  your 
fathers.  They  killed  the  prophets  and  ye  bury  them,  as  robbers 
bury  those  whom  they  have  plundered  and  slain.  Ye  act  thus 
out  of  pretended  reverence  and  zeal,  yet  ye  are  but  imitations  of 
your  fathers,  for  ye  seek  to  kill  Me  and  My  disciples,  and  by  so  doing 
fill  up  the  measure  of  their  iniquity.”  But  Suarez  explains  these 
verses  thus,  “ Inasmuch  as  ye  imitate  your  fathers  in  your  persecu- 
tion of  Christ  and  His  apostles,  ye  seem  to  build  these  sepulchres 
more  to  commemorate  the  act  of  the  slayer,  than  out  of  any  desire 
to  honour  the  slain.” 

Ver.  52. — Woe  unto  you , lawyers  I Ye  have  usurped,  as  S. 
Ambrose  renders  the  Greek  jfgari,  the  key  of  knowledge,  i.e.,  the 
teaching  of  the  law  and  the  interpretation  of  scripture.  Ye  have 
used  this  knowledge  for  your  own  evil  purposes,  and  have  prejudiced 
the  people  against  Me  and  the  salvation  which  I came  to  bestow. 
Thus  ye  shut  up  the  kingdom  of  heaven  against  men : for  ye  neither 
go  in  yourselves,  neither  suffer  ye  them  that  are  entering  to  go  in, 
S.  Matt  xxiil  13. 

Thus  S.  Ambrose  and  Tertullian ; and  S.  Cyril,  who  understands 
the  key  of  knowledge  to  mean  the  law,  the  sign  of  the  justice  of 
Christ,  and  adds,  Faith  also  is  the  key,  because  by  means  of  it  we 
retain  the  knowledge  and  the  truth,  for  “ unless  ye  believe  ye  will 
not  understand.”  These  men  therefore  shut  up  the  kingdom  of 
heaven,  for  they  neither  explained  the  Jaw  as  testifying  to  Christ, 
nor  did  they  suffer  men  to  believe  on  Him. 

/figuratively,  S.  Augustine  (lib.  ii.  Quasi.  Evang.),  alluding  to  Isa. 
xxil  22,  and  Rev.  iii.  7,  says,  The  key  of  knowledge  is  humility, 
which  these  lawyers  themselves  understood  not,  and  were  unwilling 
that  others  should  understand. 

Ver.  53.  And  the  Scribes  and  the  Pharisees  began  to  urge  Him 
vehemently.  “ To  urge  Him  vehemently,”  fa»Sc  (rvugm;  but  the 
Vulgate  has  <c  to  insist,”  as  if  Wtyjm  c<  and  to  provoke  Him  to  speak  of 
many  things,”  &v*erofiar/tyn,  i.e.  to  catch  something  out  of  His  mouth 
that  they  might  accuse  Him — to  seek  an  immediate  answer  to  their 
crafty  questionings,  and  to  confuse  Him  in  His  talk.  Euthymius

and  Theophylact  But  Maldonatus  thinks  that  ctwoarofAarlfyit  should 
be  rendered  “to  shut  His  mouth,”  i.e.  to  put  Him  to  silence.  But 
the  Scribes  did  not  wish  to  silence  Christ,  but  on  the  contrary  to 
provoke  Him  to  say  something  against  the  law  or  against  Caesar, 
whereof  they  might  accuse  Him. 

They  said  therefore,  Thou  hast  derided  our  ceremonies,  and 
broken  the  tradition  of  our  fathers,  v.  38.  Thou  hast  rebuked  us 
because  we  tithe  mint  and  rue,  v.  42.  Thou  hast  charged  us  with 
loving  the  uppermost  seats,  and  therefore  Thou  hast  blamed  Moses 
who  assigned  them  to  us,  v.  43.  Thou  hast  forbidden  us  to  honour 
the  prophets,  v.  47.  Thou  hast  deprived  us  of  the  key  of  knowledge, 
which  the  whole  synagogue  has  committed  to  our  care,  v.  52.  Thou 
desirest  therefore  to  be  wiser  than  Moses,  and  to  overthrow  the 
law,  and  the  ordinances  of  God. 

Ver.  54. — Laying  wait  for  Him>  and  seeking  to  catch  something  out 
of  His  mouth . A^ittaz/,  “to  hunt  for,”  that  they  might  accuse  Him 
to  Caiaphas  or  Pilate.  For  Euthymius  says,  “They  thought  by 
their  rapid  questionings  to  lead  Him  to  commit  Himself  to  some 
rash  statement ; but  He  answered  them  in  all  things  wisely,  for  He 
answered  nothing  but  what  had  been  well  thought  out  aforehand, 
and  He  spake  unmoved  by  any  human  passion.” 

They  trusted  that  in  anger,  or  in  excitement,  he  would  have  said 
something  with  which  they  could  find  fault,  for  men  in  the  heat  of 
argument  oftentimes  make  statements  which  they  regret  and  are 
compelled  to  retract  Not  so  with  Christ,  calm  and  unmoved, 
His  words  were  truth.

CHAPTER  XII. 

I  Christ  preacheth  to  his  disciples  to  avoid  hypocrisy , and  fearfulness  in  publishing 
his  doctrine:  13  warmth  the  people  to  beware  of  covetousness,  by  the  parable 

of  the  rich  man  who  set  up  greater  bams:  22  we  must  not  be  over  careful  of 
earthly  things , 31  but  seek  the  kingdom  of  God \ 33  give  alms , 36  be  ready  at  a 
knock  to  open  to  our  Lord  whensoever  he  cometh  : 41  Christs  ministers  are  to 
see  to  their  charge,  49  and  look  for  persecution : 54  the  people  must  take  this 
time  of  grace,  58  because  it  is  a fearful  thing  to  die  without  reconciliation, 

IN  the  meantime,  when  there  were  gathered  together  an  innumerable  multitude 
of  people,  insomuch  that  they  trode  one  upon  another,  he  began  to  say  unto 
his  disciples  first  of  all.  Beware  ye  of  the  leaven  of  the  Pharisees,  which  is 
hypocrisy. 

2  For  there  is  nothing  covered,  that  shall  not  be  revealed ; neither  hid,  that 
shall  not  be  known. 

3  Therefore  whatsoever  ye  have  spoken  in  darkness  shall  be  heard  in  the  light ; 
and  that  which  ye  have  spoken  in  the  ear  in  closets  shall  be  proclaimed  upon  the 
housetops. 

4  And  I say  unto  you  my  friends,  Be  not  afraid  of  them  that  kill  the  body,  and 
after  that  have  no  more  that  they  can  do. 

5  But  I will  forewarn  you  whom  ye  shall  fear  : Fear  him,  which  after  he  hath 
killed  hath  power  to  cast  into  hell ; yea,  I say  unto  you.  Fear  him. 

6  Are  not  five  sparrows  sold  for  two  farthings,  and  not  one  of  them  is  for- 
gotten before  God  ? 

7  But  even  the  very  hairs  of  your  head  are  all  numbered.  Fear  not,  therefore  : 
ye  are  of  more  value  than  many  sparrows. 

8  Also  I say  unto  you.  Whosoever  shall  confess  me  before  men,  him  shall  the 
Son  of  man  also  confess  before  the  angels  of  God  : 

9.  But  he  that  denieth  me  before  men  shall  be  denied  before  the  angels  of  God. 
10  And  whosoever  shall  speak  a word  against  the  Son  of  man,  it  shall  be  for- 
given him : but  unto  him  that  blasphemeth  against  the  Holy  Ghost  it  shall  not  be 
forgiven. 

1 1 And  when  they  bring  you  unto  the  synagogues,  and  unto  magistrates,  and 
powers,  take  ye  no  thought  how  or  what  thing  ye  shall  answer,  or  what  ye 
shall  say : 

12  For  the  Holy  Ghost  shall  teach  you  in  the  same  hour  what  ye  ought  to  say, 
13  And  one  of  the  company  said  unto  him,  Master,  speak  to  my  brother,  that 
he  divide  the  inheritance  with  me. 

14  And  he  said  unto  him,  Man,  who  made  me  a judge  or  a divider  over  you  ? 
15  And  he  said  unto  them,  Take  heed,  and  beware  of  covetousness:  for  a 
man’s  life  consisteth  not  in  the  abundance  of  the  things  which  he  possesseth.

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  S.  LUKE.  287 

16  And  he  spake  a parable  unto  them,  saying,  The  ground  of  a certain  rich 
man  brought  forth  plentifully  : 

17  And  he  thought  within  himself  saying,  What  shall  I do,  because  I hare  no 
room  where  to  bestow  my  fruits  ? 

18  And  he  said.  This  will  I do : I will  pull  down  my  barns,  and  build  greater ; 
and  there  will  I bestow  all  my  fruits  and  my  goods. 

19  And  I will  say  to  my  soul,  Soul,  thou  hast  much  goods  laid  up  for  many 
years ; take  thine  ease,  eat,  drink,  and  be  merry. 

20  But  God  said  unto  him.  Thou  fool,  this  night  thy  soul  shall  be  required  o! 
thee : then  whose  shall  those  things  be,  which  thou  hast  provided  ? 

21  So  is  he  that  layeth  up  treasure  for  himself,  and  is  not  rich  toward  God. 

22  And  he  said  unto  his  disciples,  Therefore  I say  unto  you.  Take  no  thought 
for  your  life,  what  you  shall  eat ; neither  for  the  body,  what  ye  shall  put  on. 

23  The  life  is  more  than  meat,  and  the  body  is  more  than  raiment 

24  Consider  the  ravens : for  they  neither  sow  nor  reap ; which  neither  have 
storehouse  nor  barn  ; and  God  feedeth  them  : how  much  more  are  ye  better  than 
the  fowls? 

25  And  which  of  you  with  taking  thought  ran  add  to  his  stature  one  cubit? 

26  If  ye  then  be  not  able  to  do  that  thing  which  is  least,  why  take  ye  thought 
for  the  rest  ? 

27  Consider  the  lilies  how  they  grow  : they  toil  not,  they  spin  not ; and  yet  I 
say  unto  you,  that  Solomon  in  all  his  glory  was  not  arrayed  like  one  of  these. 

28  If  then  God  so  clothe  the  grass,  which  is  to-day  in  the  field,  and  to-morrow 
is  cast  into  the  oven  ; how  much  more  will  ho  clothe  you , O ye  of  little  faith  ? 

29  And  seek  not  ye  wbat  ye  shall  eat,  or  what  ye  shall  drink,  neither  be  ye  of 
doubtful  mind. 

30  For  all  these  things  do  the  nations  of  the  world  seek  after:  and  your 
Father  knoweth  that  ye  have  need  of  these  things. 

31  But  rather  seek  ye  the  kingdom  of  God;  and  all  these  things  shall  be 
added  unto  you. 

32  Fear  not,  little  flock ; for  it  is  your  Father’s  good  pleasure  to  give  you  the 
kingdom. 

33  Sell  that  ye  have,  and  give  alms ; provide  yourselves  bags  which  wax  not 
old,  a treasure  in  the  heavens  that  faileth  not,  where  no  thief  approacheth, 
neither  moth  corrupteth. 

34  For  where  your  treasure  is,  there  will  your  heart  be  also. 

35  Let  your  loins  be  girded  about,  and  your  lights  burning ; 

36  And  ye  yourselves  like  unto  men  that  wait  for  their  lord,  when  he  will 
return  from  the  wedding ; that  when  he  cometh  and  knocketh,  they  may  open 
unto  him  immediately. 

37  Blessed  are  those  servants,  whom  the  lord  when  he  cometh  shall  find 
watching  : verily  I say  unto  you,  that  he  shall  gird  himself,  and  make  them  to  sit 
down  to  meat,  and  will  come  forth  and  serve  them. 

38  And  if  he  shall  come  in  the  second  watch,  or  come  in  the  third  watch  and 
find  them  so,  blessed  are  those  servants. 

39  And  this  know,  that  if  the  goodmanof  the  house  had  known  what  hour  the 
thief  would  come,  he  would  have  watched,  and  not  have  suffered  his  house  to  be 
broken  through.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XII. 

40  Be  ye  therefore  ready  also : for  the  Son  of  man  cometh  at  an  hour  when.ye 
think  not. 

41  Then  Peter  said  unto  him,  Lord,  speakest  thou  this  parable  unto  us,  or 
even  to  all  ? 

42  And  the  Lord  said,  Who  then  is  that  faithful  and  wise  steward,  whom  his 
lord  shall  make  ruler  over  his  household,  to  give  them  their  portion  of  meat  in 
due  season  ? 

43  Blessed  is  that  servant,  whom  his  lord  when  he  cometh  shall  find  so  doing. 

44  Of  a truth  I say  unto  you,  that  he  will  make  him  ruler  over  all  that  he  hath. 

45  But  and  if  that  servant  say  in  his  heart.  My  Lord  delayeth  his  coming ; and 
shall  begin  to  beat  the  men  servants  and  maidens,  and  to  eat  and  drink,  and  to 
be  drunken. 

46  The  lord  of  that  servant  will  come  in  a day  when  he  looketh  not  for  hint, 
and  at  an  hour  when  he  is  not  aware,  and  will  cut  him  in  sunder,  and  will 
appoint  him  his  portion  with  the  unbelievers. 

47  And  that  servant,  which  knew  his  lord’s  will,  and  prepared  not  himself, 
neither  did  according  to  his  will,  shall  be  beaten  with  many  strifes. 

48  But  he  that  knew  not,  and  did  commit  things  worthy  of  stripes,  shall  be 
beaten  with  few  stripes.  For  unto  whomsoever  much  is  given,  of  him  shall  be 
much  required : and  to  whom  men  have  committed  much,  of  him  they  will  ask 
the  more. 

49  1 am  come  to  send  fire  on  the  earth ; and  what  will  I,  if  it  be  already 
kindled  ? 

50  But  I have  a baptism  to  be  baptized  with  ; and  how  am  I straitened  till  it 
be  accomplished  1 

51  Suppose  ye  that  I am  come  to  give  peace  on  earth?  I tell  you.  Nay ; but 
rather  division  : 

52  For  from  henceforth  there  shall  be  five  in  one  house  divided,  three  against 
two,  and  two  against  three. 

53  The  father  shall  be  divided  against  the  son,  and  the  son  against  the  father ; 
the  mother  against  the  daughter,  and  the  daughter  against  the  mother ; the 
mothcr-in-law  against  her  daughter-in-law,  and  the  daughter-in-law  against  her 
mother-in-law. 

54  And  he  said  also  to  the  people.  When  ye  see  a cloud  rise  out  of  the  west, 
straightway  ye  say.  There  cometh  a shower ; and  so  it  is. 

55  And  when  ye  see  the  south  wind  blow,  ye  say,  There  will  be  heat ; and  it 
cometh  to  pass. 

56  Ye  hypocrites,  ye  can  discern  the  face  of  the  sky  and  of  the  earth ; but  how 
is  it  that  you  do  not  discern  this  time  ? 

57  Yea,  and  why  even  of  yourselves  judge  ye  not  what  is  right  ? 

58  When  thou  goest  with  thine  adversary  to  the  magistrate,  as  thou  art  in  the 
way,  give  diligence  that  thou  mayest  be  delivered  from  him  ; lest  he  hale  thee  to 
the  judge,  and  the  judge  deliver  thee  to  the  officer,  and  the  officer  cast  thee  into 
prison. 

59  I tell  thee,  thou  shalt  not  depart  thence  till  thou  hast  paid  the  very  last  mite. 

Ver.  1. — In  the  mean  time  when  there  were  gathered  together  an  innu- 
merable multitude  of  people.  The  Greek  has  “ the  myriads  of  the  multi-

tilde.*  A myriad  contains  exactly  ten  thousand,  and  is  consequently 
taken  for  an  innumerable  multitude,  as  here. 

Ver.  2. — Beware  ye  of  the  leaven  of  the  Pharisees.  Beware, 
says  Bede,  that  you  do  not  imitate  the  hypocrites,  for  the  time 
will  certainly  come  when  both  your  virtue  and  their  hypocrisy 
will  be  revealed  to  alL  I have  explained  the  remainder  on 
Matt  x.  26. 

Ver.  13. — And  one  of  the  multitude  said  unto  Him.  My  brother  is 
injuring  me,  for  he  wishes  to  seize  the  whole  of  our  father's  property, 
and  he  will  give  me  no  share  of  it.  Command  him  therefore  to  do 
me  justice,  for  Thou  by  Thy  authority  canst  do  this  with  a word, 
which  I cannot  effect  by  many  suits  and  much  litigation.  For  it  is 
Thy  office  to  defend  the  right  and  assist  the  oppressed,  for  Thou  art 
the  Lord  of  justice. 

Ver.  14. — But  He  said  unto  him , Man , who  made  Me  a judge  or  a 
divider  over  you  t The  word  “ man  ” is  a Hebraism  for  an  unknown 
person,  as  in  chap.  xxii.  58,  Peter  said,  “ Man,  I am  not,”  and  v.  60, 
“ Man,  I know  not  what  thou  sayest”  The  meaning  is,  This  is 
a matter  of  the  courts  which  dispose  of  secular  questions : it  has 
no  part  in  Me,  who  teach  and  dispense  a heavenly  heritage.  Christ 
does  not  here  deny  that  He  has  judicial  power,  for  He  was  the 
King  of  kings  and  the  Lord  of  lords ; but  He  wished  to  use  His 
power  over  a covetous  man  to  cure  him  of  his  greed,  and  to  teach 
him  to  prefer  heavenly  to  earthly  things,  and  to  give  way  willingly 
to  them,  according  to  His  own  words,  vi.  29,  “From  him  that  taketh 
away  thy  cloke  withhold  not  thy  coat  also.”  “ He  rightly  sets  aside 
earthly  things,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ who  came  down  to  us  for  heavenly 
ones.  Hence  this  brother  is  rebuked  not  undeservedly,  for  he 
would  fain  have  occupied  the  dispenser  of  heavenly  things  with 
those  of  earth.”  At  the  same  time  He  taught  that  ecclesiastics  and 
spiritual  persons  ought  not  to  meddle  with  secular  things,  but  to 
employ  themselves  in  divine  ones,  as  S.  Paul  says,  2 Tim  ii.  4,  “No 
soldier  on  service  entangleth  himself  in  the  affairs  of  this  life.”  So 
S.  Ambrose,  Euthymius,  Bede,  and  de  Lyra  from  S.  Augustine  ( serm .

former  ages  used  to  settle  these,  as  S.  Augustine  says  that  he  has 
done.  Lib.  de  Opere  Monachor , c.  29. 

And  He  said  to  them , “ as  well  to  His  disciples,”  the  Syriac  says, 
“as  to  the  multitude,”  especially  to  him  who  had  spoken  about  his 
brother  dividing  the  property,  Take  heed.  In  this  contention  of 
brothers  how  much  ill  was  caused  by  avarice.  Whilst  one  from 
avarice  refused  to  divide  the  inheritance,  the  other,  with  too  much 
cupidity  and  out  of  all  season,  urged  the  division.  Strife  and  dis- 
sention  arose  among  them.  Not  only  should  we  guard  against  the 
lust  of  seizing  what  is  another’s,  but  also  from  too  great  cupidity  to 
get  possession  of  what  is  our  own,  for  they  who  are  too  eager  for 
earthly  riches,  neglect  heavenly  ones.  S.  Augustine,  in  his  28th 
Sermo . De  diversis:  “Not  only  is  he  avaricious  who  seizes  what  is 
another’s,  but  he  also  who  covetously  keeps  his  own.”  The  Arabic 
has,  “ See  and  beware  of  all  evil — for  avarice  is  the  cause  of  all  evil,” 
as  in  1 Tim.  vi.  10,  “ The  love  of  money  is  the  root  of  all  eviL” 

For  a man's  life  consisteth  not  in  the  abundance  of  the  things  which 
he  possesseth.  That  is,  it  is  not  because  a man  abounds  in  riches 
that  his  life  is  abundant,  so  as  to  be  longer  and  happier  on  that 
account,  for  it  is  shortened  and  made  unhappy  from  the  anxiety  and 
luxury  which  attend  upon  great  wealth.  The  Syriac  version  has, 
“ Life  is  not  in  the  abundance  of  riches ; ” the  Arabic,  “ Man  has  not 
abundance  in  his  much  wealth  ” — that  is,  abundance  does  not  pro- 
long our  lives,  but  rather  shortens  them.  Theophylact  says,  “ The 
measure  of  life  is  not  contained  in  its  abundance.  For  he  who  has 
great  possessions  does  not  live  longer  for  them,  nor  does  length  of 
life  attend  upon  the  multitude  of  his  riches;”  and  Euthymius,  “Not 
because  a man  abounds  in  riches,  does  his  life  abound  from  such 
abundance.  The  measure  of  his  life  does  not  depend  upon  this.” 
The  meaning  is,  Thou,  O man,  who  greedily  seekest  a heritage 
from  thy  brother,  seekest  it  that  thou  mayest  live  long  and  comfort- 
ably. But  thou  errest;  for  the  rich,  from  their  cares  and  the 
gluttony  they  indulge  in,  often  pass  short  and  miserable  lives.  If 
thou  wouldest  live  long  and  profitably,  despise  money,  be  poor  in 
spirit,  entrust  thy  hopes  and  wealth  to  God  alone,  for  He  is  the  only

PARABLE  OF  THE  RICH  MAN. 


29I 


giver  of  length  of  life  and  happiness.  To  show  this  Christ  adds  the 
following  parable.  S.  Augustine,  On  Abel  and  Cain,  i.  5,  at  the  end : 
“ If  thou  seek  treasures,  choose  the  unseen  and  hidden,  those  which 
are  to  be  found  in  the  highest  heavens,  not  sought  in  the  veins  of 
the  earth.  Be  poor  in  spirit  and  thou  shalt  be  rich  by  every  reckon- 
ing ; for  the  life  of  man  consists  not  in  the  abundance  of  his  wealth, 
but  in  virtue  and  faith.  These  riches  make  us  rich  indeed,  if  we  be 
rich  in  God.” 

Ver.  16. — And  He  spake  a parable  unto  them,  saying \ The  ground 
of  a certain  rich  man  brought  forth  plentifully . The  ground  in  the 
Greek  (*<$?<*)  means  a large  extent  of  land,  a number  of  fields. 

And  he  reasoned  with  himself  saying.  What  shall  I dot  &c  Behold 
the  care,  behold  the  poverty  of  this  rich  man — he  who  is  overflowing 
with  wealth  and  receptacles  has  need  of  some  place  in  which  to 
store  his  goods.  He  is  in  doubt  and  perplexity,  says  Euthymius, 
as  if  he  were  really  poor,  though  he  is  in  truth  wealthy.  And  S. 
Basil,  in  his  homily  on  these  words  of  Christ : “ The  earth  did  not 
return  fruits  but  lamentations ; for  this  unhappy  man  is  afflicted 
quite  as  much  as  they  who  are  oppressed  by  want,  and  he  cries  out 
saying,  * What  shall  I do?’  Does  not  he  who  is  in  straits  from  his 
poverty  utter  the  same  words?  and  he  who  has  to  beg?,,  From  all 
the  good  things  that  flowed  in  upon  him  he  derived  no  gratification. 
They  rather  annoyed  his  mind  and  troubled  him. 

Ver.  17. — My  fruits . “Did  he  not,”  says  S.  Basil,  “collect  his 
crops  and  incur  the  reputation  of  avarice  when  he  called  them  his 
own?”  For  how  many  dangers  are  there  before  the  harvest  is 
gathered  in.  The  hail  often  beats  it  down,  and  the  heat  snatches 
it  out  of  the  very  grasp,  and  rains  suddenly  rush  down  from  the 
mountains  and  sweep  it  away. 

Ver.  18. — And  he  said,  This  will  I do,  I will  pull  down  my  bams, 
&c.  All  the  harvests  collected  in  past  years.  He  took  counsel  of 
his  cupidity,  not  of  his  charity,  which  would  have  said  to  him, 
“ Spend  them  on  the  poor.”  “Dost  thou  want  barns?  Thou  hast  them 
in  the  bellies  of  the  poor,”  says  S.  Basil ; and  S.  Ambrose  (Lib.  de 
Naboth , cap . vii.),  “ Thou  hast  storehouses ; the  bosoms  of  the

poor,  the  houses  of  widows  and  orphans,  the  mouths  of  infants.  Let 
these  be  thy  barns,  and  they  will  last  thee  for  ever.”  S.  Basil  again, 
in  the  homily  above:  “He  is  a despoiler  who,  when  he  receives 
what  he  ought  to  dispense,  considers  it  as  his  own.  The  bread  thou 
hast  is  the  bread  of  the  famishing,  thy  robe  is  the  robe  of  the  naked, 
thy  silver  that  is  buried  in  the  ground  is  the  silver  of  the  indigent : 
wherefore  dost  thou  wrong  so  many  poor  whom  thou  mightest  sup- 
port?” He  adds,  “And  when  thou  hast  filled  thy  barns,  what  wilt 
thou  do  with  the  harvest  of  the  following  year  ? Wilt  thou  pull  them 
down  again  and  build  new  ones  for  ever?  Thou  wilt  always  be 
consuming  thy  substance  and  thy  wealth  in  pulling  down  the 
old  and  building  new,  that  the  fruits  which  sprang  from  the  earth 
may  return  to  it  again.  Thou  wilt  not  bestow  them  upon  the  poor, 
because  thou  enviest  others  the  use  of  them,  and  thus,  when  earth 
restored  them  again  to  thee,  thou  deprivest  all  men  of  their  benefit, 
nay  even  thyself ; for  as  com,  falling  into  the  ground,  brings  gain  to 
the  sower,  so  thy  bread,  if  thou  gavest  it  to  the  hungry,  would  bring 
thee  much  profit  hereafter.” 

And  I will  say  to  my  sou/,  Soul,  thou  hast  much  goods  laid  up  for 
many  years.  This  rich  man  again  errs  and  commits  sin.  First,  in 
promising  himself  very  many  years,  when  he  was  to  die  that  night 
“He  who  promised  himself  a long  life  did  not  see  the  following 
day,”  says  S.  Gregory  (22  Moral  chap.  6).  And  S.  Cyril,  in  the 
Catena,  “Thou  hast  fruits  in  thy  barns,  O rich  man,  but  whence 
hast  thou  many  years?”  Secondly,  in  giving  himself  up  to  gluttony 
and  luxury,  saying,  “ Eat,  drink,  and  be  merry  like  an  Epicurean.” 
For  after  death  is  no  enjoyment 

Take  thine  ease . To  the  plague  of  avarice  is  joined  that  of  sloth, 
says  the  Gloss.  “ If  you  had  the  soul  of  a sow,”  says  S.  Basil, 
“what  else  could  you  propose  for  yourself? — you  are  so  brutish,  so 
ignorant  of  the  soul’s  good,  that  you  indulge  it  in  carnal  gratification.” 
Being  wholly  of  the  flesh,  you  make  yourself  a slave  to  its  lusts. 
An  appellation  worthy  of  you,  was  bestowed  upon  you,  “ Thou  fool, 
this  night  shall  thy  soul  be  required  of  thee.” 

S.  Ambrose  (Lib.  ii.  de  Inter  pell,  in  Job  c.  5)  says  wisely,  “ A great

Ver.  20. — But  God  said  unto  him.  God  said  this,  not  in  word 
but  in  deed,  sending  him  a fever  or  some  other  mortal  disease,  and 
causing  his  conscience  by  this  means  to  speak  thus  to  him.  “ God 
said  this  to  the  rich  man,”  says  Euthymius,  “ through  his  conscience, 
which,  as  he  felt  death  coming  upon  him,  said  this  to  him.” 

Thou  fool.  Because  in  thy  plan,  in  which  thou  appearedst  to 
thyself  wise,  thou  now  perceivest  that  thou  wast  a fool. 

This  night.  “ His  soul,  which  would  take  no  heed  of  light,  and 
which  was  tending  on  to  Gehenna,  was  taken  in  the  night”  Gregory,

of  the  riches  and  other  property  which  God  has  given  to  thee.”  So 
Toletus.  They  seek  it  again,  because  thy  soul  does  not  die  with  the 
body,  but  is  immortal ; thy  soul,  too,  is  not  thy  own,  but  God’s,  who 
breathed  it  into  thee  and  entrusted  it  to  thee  as  a sacred  gift  Rightly, 
therefore,  does  He  now  seek  it  of  thee  again  by  a sudden  death. 
Hear  S.  Jerome  on  the  death  that  is  imminent  on  all  (Ep.  iil  to 
Heliodorus ) : “ Xerxes,  that  most  mighty  king,  who  overthrew  moun- 
tains, who  controlled  seas,  when  he  had  viewed  from  a lofty  place 
an  infinite  multitude  of  men  and  an  immense  army,  is  said  to  have 
wept,  because  after  a hundred  years  none  of  those  whom  he  then  saw 
would  be  surviving.  Oh,  if  we  could  ascend  such  a tower  from  which 
we  could  see  the  whole  earth  under  our  feet ! I would  show  you 
the  ruins  of  the  world — nations  in  strife  with  nations — kings  with 
kings — and,  not  the  army  of  Xerxes  alone,  but  the  inhabitants  of  the 
entire  globe,  who  are  now  alive,  in  a short  space  of  time  passed  away.” 
And  the  things  which  thou  hast  prepared,  whose  shall  they  bet 
“ They  shall  not  only  not  belong  to  thee,”  says  Euthymius,  “ they  shall 
not  be  thine ; but  thou  dost  not  know  whose  they  will  be — whether 
thy  heir’s  or  a stranger’s,  a friend’s  or  an  enemy's ; — and  this  increases

thy  grief.”  S.  James  says,  “ They  shall  eat  your  flesh  as  fire”  (v.  3) ; 
and  S.  Ambrose,  “ The  things  that  we  cannot  carry  with  us  are  not 
our  own.  Virtue  alone  is  the  companion  of  the  dead.  Mercy  alone 
follows  us — and  mercy  alone  gains  abodes  for  the  departed.”  S. 
Augustine:  “The  purse  contains  that  which  Christ  receives  not” 
{Horn,  48,  inter,  50).  Well  says  the  wise  man,  “ What  fortune  has 
lent  let  her  take,  what  nature  has  changed  let  her  seek  again,  what 
virtue  has  gained  she  will  retain.”  See  what  I have  collected 
from  the  Fathers  on  vanity  and  the  pemiciousness  of  riches  on 
Isaiah  v.  9. 

Ver.  21. — So  is  he  that  layeth  up  treasure  for  himself.  Such  an 
end  and  such  a death  did  the  rich  covetous  man  meet  who  had 
not  laid  up  treasure  toward  God.  It  will  be  asked.  Who  is  rich 
towards  God  ? I answer — He  who  has  by  alms  and  other  good 
works  many  merits  and  safeguards  hidden  up  as  treasures  before 
God,  and  who  day  by  day  hides  more,  as  the  apostle  teaches  at 
length,  1 Tim.  vi.  17  and  following.  See  what  is  said  thereon. 

Secondly,  “He  is  rich  in  God  who  studies  to  please  God  alone,  who 
fixes  all  his  hope  and  love  on  God,  who  rests  wholly  on  Him,  that 
he  may  be  blessed  by  Him  and  made  eternally  happy.”  “ He  is 
rich,”  says  the  Gloss,  “ whose  expectation  is  the  Lord,  and  whose 
substance  is  with  God.”  “The  rich  in  God,”  says  S.  Augustine, 
“ is  poor  in  gold  ” ( Serm . xxviii.  de  verb,  Apostolt) — that  is,  poor  in 
spirit,  as  St.  Peter  was  when  he  said  to  the  lame  man,  “ Silver  and 
gold  have  I none  \ but  what  I have,  that  I give  thee.  In  the  name 
of  Jesus  Christ  of  Nazareth,  walk,”  Acts  iil  On  Ps.  xl  he  says, 
“When  Christ  was  rich  He  became  poor,  that  by  His  poverty 
He  might  make  you  rich.  He  enriches  the  truly  poor,  He  brings 
the  falsely  rich  to  poverty.  c Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit,  for  theirs 
is  the  kingdom  of  heaven,1  ” Matt  v.  3.  “ Let  us  endeavour,”  says 
Theophylact,  “ to  be  made  rich  in  God,  that  is,  to  have  trust  in  Him, 
that  He  may  have  our  wealth  and  the  granary  of  it,  and  not  call  our 
goods  our  own  but  God's,  and  if  they  are  God's,  let  us  not  deprive 
Him  of  His  own.  This  is  to  be  rich  in  God,  to  believe  that  if  I 
give  Him  all  things  and  empty  myself,  nothing  that  is  needful  for

THE  TRUE  RICHES.  295 

my  good  shall  ever  fail  me.  God  is  my  storehouse,  which  I will 
open  and  take  from  it  all  of  which  I have  need.1’ 

Thirdly,  He  who  is  rich,  that  is  liberal,  in  God,  is  charitable  to  the 
poor.  For  what  is  done  to  them  God  holds  to  be  done  to  Himself 
and  rewards  it  “ Let  him,”  says  Bede,  “ who  wishes  to  be  rich  in 
God,  not  lay  up  treasure  to  himself,  but  distribute  his  possessions 
among  the  poor.”  The  meaning  is  good,  but  it  is  not  complete  : for 
Christ  is  not  speaking  here  exclusively  of  almsgiving,  but  of  the  true 
riches,  which  He  declares  to  be  not  the  fruits  of  the  ground  and  the 
wealth  of  mines,  but  virtues  and  good  works,  for  these  procure  us 
long  life  and  blessing,  as  well  in  this  world  as  in  the  world  to  come. 

Fourthly,  S.  Augustine,  in  his  44th  Discourse  on  the  Temptation, 
teaches  that  “ he  is  rich  to  God  who  is  full  of  love  and  therefore  of 
God.”  “ God  is  love,  and  he  that  abideth  in  love  abideth  in  God,  and 
God  abideth  in  him,”  1 John  iv.  16.  “ If  you  have  love  you  have 

God.  What  has  the  rich  man  if  he  have  not  love  ? If  a poor  man 
have  love,  what  has  he  not  ? You  think  him  rich  perhaps  whose 
chest  is  full  of  gold ; and  is  he  not  so  whose  conscience  is  full  of  God  ? 
He  is  truly  rich  in  whom  God  deigns  to  dwell.”  S.  Augustine. 

Lastly,  The  rich  man  toward  God  is  one  who  abounds  in  every 
virtue.  So  S.  Ambrose  explains  at  length  (lib.  iv.  epis.  27)  to  Sira- 
plicianus,  whose  words  I have  cited  on  1 Peter  iii.  4,  “ That  which 
is  not  corruptible,  the  ornament  of  a meek  and  quiet  spirit,  which  is 
in  the  sight  of  God  of  great  price.” 

In  allegory . The  rich  toward  God  are  the  blessed  who  enjoy 
God  and  all  His  works.  S.  Augustine  ( Serm . 74  de  Temp.)  teaches 
that  the  blessed  alone  are  happy,  both  because  they  possess  God, 
and  want  nothing.  “ He,”  he  says,  “ is  truly  rich  who  wants  nothing, 
but  the  blessed  alone  want  nothing — the  blessed  alone  are  truly 
happy.”  He  says  in  the  preface  of  Psalm  xli.,  “ Christ  was  rich  to 
the  Father,  and  poor  to  us — rich  in  heaven,  poor  on  earth — rich  as 
God,  poor  as  man.” 

S.  Ambrose  in  his  Epistle  to  Demetrias,  wisely  says,  “ By  what 
price  can  the  repose  of  this  world  be  more  fitly  purchased  than  by 
the  restoration  to  the  world  itself  of  all  riches,  all  dignities,  and  all

desires  ; and  the  purchase  of  Christian  liberty  by  a holy  and  happy 
community  by  which  the  sons  of  God,  from  having  been  poor  will 
be  made  rich,  from  patient  will  become  brave,  from  humility  be 
exalted  ? ” 

Ver.  29. — Neither  he  ye  of  doubtful  mind  (The  Greek  and  the 
Vulgate  say,  “ Be  ye  not  lifted  up  on  high.”)  Cornelius  comments 
on  this  reading,  this  passage  is  explained  in  many  different  ways. 
S.  Clement  of  Alexandria  (Peed.  lib.  ii.  10)  says,  “ Be  not  led  away 
from  the  truth  to  wish  for  a higher  wisdom  than  faith  teaches.” 

Secondly,  S.  Augustine  (Lib.  ii.  Queest.  29,  Evang.  Quasi.) : “Be  not 
puffed  up  with  pride  because  you  have  much  food  and  clothing.  For 
to  be  proud  of  having  abundance  of  provision,  is  like  a wounded 
man  boasting  that  he  has  many  plasters  at  hand,  when  it  would 
have  been  well  for  him  not  to  have  needed  any.” 

Euthymius  : “ Be  not  dragged  down  from  lofty  and  heavenly  con- 
cerns to  earthly  ones,  so  as  to  study  and  pursue  not  the  former  but 
the  latter.”  Theophylact : “ Be  not  unstable,  always  imagining  what 
is  above  you,  as  they  do  who  are  not  content  with  the  present  but 
are  always  looking  on  to  something  greater.” 

Fifthly  and  best : Be  not  anxious  about  the  heavenly  bodies  over 
your  head — the  constellations  of  the  stars  and  their  courses — the 
shifting  of  the  clouds — the  breath  of  the  winds,  so  as  to  judge  from 
them  of  the  future  abundance  or  deficiency  of  your  crops ; as  in 
Jer.  x 2,  “ Be  not  dismayed  at  the  signs  of  heaven,  for  the  heathen  are 
dismayed  at  them ; ” and  Eccles.  xi.  4,  “ He  that  observeth  the  wind 
shall  not  sow,  and  he  that  regardeth  the  clouds  shall  not  reap.”  So 
Toletus,  Vatablus,  &c  Vatablus  says,  “ Be  not  uneasy,  as  one  who 
turns  his  face  askance  to  the  heavens  from  anxiety.”  44  Be  not  waver- 
ing in  your  minds  as  a pendulum  in  the  air,  looking  to  human  assistance 
in  different  directions,  and  not  anchoring  on  the  providence  of  God.” 
The  Arabic  version  says,  “ Be  ye  not  anxious.”  For  all  things  point 
in  this  direction,  that  Christ  will  remove  from  us  too  great  anxiety 
as  to  our  support  and  clothing,  and  will  impress  on  us  a sure  con- 
fidence in  God  by  which  to  look  with  certainty  to  His  Fatherly 
providence  for  all  these  things.  The  Greek  word  fi$rtupg  conveys

OVER-ANXIETY  DEPRECATED.

the  idea  of  one  whose  mind  is  in  doubt  and  suspense  and  is  unfixed, 
who  will  judge  by  the  result,  and  is,  as  Gaza  calls  it,  “ wavering  ” 
(pensilis).  Others  render  it,  “ Do  not  look  out  from  afar  off,”  or  as 
we  commonly  say,  Do  not  make  a long  discursus,  as  though  you 
would  have  no  room  for  a Divine  Providence,  or  as  if  you  doubted 
of  it  And  F.  Lucas ; “ Be  not  over-anxious,  as  looking  out  with 
anxiety  for  what  may  happen  in  the  far  distant  future,  and  taking 
thought  long  before  for  your  future  bodily  needs,  and  looking  for- 
ward in  the  distant  times  to  come  with  solicitude  about  your  food 
and  clothing,  as  S.  Matthew  clearly  explains  it,  * Be  not  therefore 
anxious  for  the  morrow/  ” vi.  34.  All  these  words  tend  to  the  same 
point,  forbidding  us  to  show  too  great  anxiety  for  the  future,  and 
directing  us  to  resign  it  into  the  hands  of  Providence ; to  trust  in 
it  and  securely  rest  upon  it  Following  this  precept  of  Christ,  S. 
Thomas  wished  and  ordered  all  his  brotherhood  to  live  for  the  day 
and  reserve  nothing  for  the  morrow,  but  to  give  what  was  over 
and  above  their  day's  need  to  the  poor;  as  being  confident  that 
God  would  provide  for  the  morrow,  as  He  did  to  Elijah  and  Paul 
the  first  hermit,  sending  them  food  daily  by  a raven ; and  as  the 
children  of  Israel,  who  were  certainly  three  millions,  were  fed  daily 
in  the  desert  with  manna  sufficient  for  their  support,  which  was  rained 
down  upon  them  from  heaven  for  forty  years,  while  their  clothes 
remained  undamaged  and  perfect  and  even  grew  with  the  growing 
children. 

Ver.  32. — Fear  not,  little  flock.  Fear  not  lest  your  food  and  raiment 
fail  you,  and  lest,  if  you  lay  aside  all  anxiety  and  sell  your  goods  and 
give  to  the  poor,  these  things  should  not  be  added  to  you ; if  you  seek 
firstly  the  kingdom  of  God.  “ Little  flock,” — little,  because,  firstly, 
the  faithful  were  so  few  and  these  poor  either  in  position  and  pro- 
perty, or  in  election  and  feeling,  or  in  spirit ; for  they  despised  the 
riches  of  the  world  that  they  might  strive  after  those  of  heaven,  and 
therefore,  they  were  little  in  the  eyes  of  the  world,  they  were 
of  no  account,  and  were  despised.  But  now  that  the  faith  of 
Christ  has  so  spread  throughout  the  whole  world,  that  kings  and 
princes  are  subdued  to  it,  it  is  no  longer  a little  flock  but  a most

ample  and  powerful  church.  Secondly,  the  flock  of  faithful  men  is 
little  if  compared  with  the  angels  who  are  without  number,  says 
Euthymius,  according  to  the  words,  Dan.  vii.  10,  “Thousand  thou- 
sands ministered  unto  Him,  and  ten  thousand  times  ten  thousand 
stood  before  Him.” 

Thirdly,  The  flock  is  little  if  compared  with  the  immense  multitude 
of  unbelievers  and  wicked.  Bede  adds,  “ It  is  called  a little  flock 
either  on  account  of  its  humility  or  in  comparison  with  the  greater 
number  of  the  reprobate.  Then  all  the  faithful,  from  the  example  of 
Christ,  will  willingly  reduce  themselves  to  Christian  humility  and 
poverty,  especially  the  apostles  and  disciples  of  Christ  Hence  Christ 
says,  4 Sell  that  thou  hast.1  ” It  appears  that  “ flock  ” (pusillus)  is 
here  put  in  the  nominative  instead  of  the  vocative  as  is  done  in 
other  passages.  This  nominative  is  more  forcible  and  significant 
than  the  vocative  would  be.  Wherefore,  although  we  might  explain 
it  by  adding  something,  e.g.,  Fear  not,  you  who  are  a little  flock,  that 
the  nominative  might  remain,  yet  the  nominative  is  more  tersely 
and  strongly  put  for  the  vocative  by  adding  nothing.  Fear  not  then, 
O ye  faithful,  for  although  you  are  a little  flock,  God  estimates  you 
highly,  and  has  a great  and  peculiar  care  of  you,  and  Christ  the  Lord 
is  your  shepherd,  who  will  feed  you  abundantly,  according  to  the 
words,  “ I am  the  good  Shepherd”  (S.  John  x.  n),  and  the  others 
(Ps.  xxiii.  1,  2),  “ The  Lord  is  my  shepherd,  therefore  can  I lack 
nothing  ” — “ He  shall  feed  me  in  a green  pasture,  and  lead  me  forth 
beside  the  waters  of  comfort.”  S.  Peter  Chrysologus  (serm.  xxil) : 
“A  small  flock  to  the  world  is  a large  one  to  God ;”  and  (xxiii): 
“ Humility  has  gained  what  pride  lost,  and  the  little  flock  has  sub- 
dued entire  and  various  savagenesses  (nations)  by  its  meekness ; for 
the  little  flock  conquered  and  destroyed  as  many  kinds  of  beasts  as 
it  subdued  nations  to  the  yoke  of  Christ.  It  did  this  not  by  bearing 
but  by  suffering,  not  by  fighting  but  by  dying  for  Christ” 

It  is  your  Father's  good  pleasure  to  give  you  the  kingdom . To  you 
who  are  not  slow,  not  idle,  not  presuming  on  the  mere  mercy  of 
God,  but  who  hear  My  words  and  truly  obey  them ; who  therefore 
bear  your  cross  after  Me,  mortify  your  passions,  and  are  continually

zealous  in  good  works.  “ To  give,”  not  absolutely,  but  upon  condi- 
tions— namely,  that  you  persevere  in  My  faith  and  love  and  in 
obedience  even  to  death — for  to  Judas,  who  afterwards  apostatised 
from  Christ,  the  kingdom  was  not  given.  Christ  gives  the  reason 
why  the  disciples,  though  a little  flock  and  poor,  should  not  fear  lest 
needful  things  should  be  withheld  from  them,  for  He  says,  “ Since 
God  so  loved  you  as  to  destine  you  for  heavenly  riches  and  the 
kingdom  of  God,  He  will  assuredly  not  refuse  you  these  worthless 
earthly  riches,  as  far  as  they  are  necessary  for  your  journey  towards 
the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  that  you  may  adorn  it  by  your  life  and 
conversation.”  So  S.  Cyril,  in  the  Catena , “ He  who  has  given  you 
gifts  of  such  great  price,  how  will  He  be  not  merciful  to  you  but 
suffer  you  to  perish  of  hunger?” 

Ver.  33. — Sell  that  ye  have , and  give  aims . This  is  a counsel,  not 
a precept,  as  Pelagius  would  have  it,  who  said  that  all  Christians 
ought  to  be  poor,  from  the  precept  of  Christ  This  is  shewn  by 
the  words  of  Christ  (Matt.  xix.  21),  “If  thou  wouldst  be  perfect, 
go  sell  that  thou  hast  and  give  to  the  poor.”  That  you  may  study 
evangelical  perfection,  sell  what  you  possess  and  give  the  price  to 
the  poor,  that  you  may  follow  Me  who  am  poor  in  spirit  in  a like 
poverty,  and  with  me  despise  earthly  riches,  that  so  you  may  obtain 
heavenly  ones.  Do  this  with  the  end  that  you  may  show  yourselves 
not  anxious  for  food  and  raiment,  but  that  you  depend  solely  on 
God,  and  look  to  Him  for  all  those  needs  of  life  which  He  Himself 
has  promised  to  all  who  seek  His  kingdom.  For  this  reason  the 
first  Christians,  following  the  counsel  of  Christ,  sold  all  that  they 
had  and  laid  the  price  at  the  feet  of  the  apostles,  that  they  might 
distribute  them  among  the  poor  believers  (Acts  ii  3,  4).  So  Bede : 
u Fear  not  that  you  will  lack  the  needful  things  of  life,  but  rather 
sell  what  you  possess  for  alms.  This  is  done  worthily  when  he  who 
lives  by  the  labour  of  his  hands,  despises  all  things,  and  gives  alms.” 

Provide  yourselves  bags  which  wax  not  old.  Wax  not  old,  and 
from  which,  therefore,  the  coin  of  spiritual  alms  cannot  drop  out  and 
be  lost,  as  the  money  of  the  world  often  falls  from  the  old  and  worn- 
out  purses  of  the  rich.  The  purses  that  wax  not  old  are  the  bosoms

of  the  poor,  and  more  especially  the  mind  and  memory  of  God,  in 
which  He  keeps  as  in  a purse  your  alms  and  good  works,  that  He 
may  return  you  the  most  ample  rewards  for  them  in  the  day  of  judg- 
ment. This  He  Himself  explains,  adding,  a treasure  in  the  heavens 
that  faileth  not , where  no  thief  draweth  near,  neither  moth  destroyeth . 
From  this  Chrysologus  rightly  concludes,  “ What  have  they  to  do 
with  the  earth  who  possess  heaven — what  with  human  affairs  who 
have  gained  divine  ones — unless,  perhaps,  they  find  pleasure  in 
lamentations,  choose  labours,  delight  in  dangers,  love  the  most 
cruel  deaths,  and  find  the  evil  things  that  are  brought  upon  them 
more  pleasing  than  the  good  ones  ? ” 

Ver.  34. — For  where  your  treasure  is,  there  will  your  heart  be 
also . This  is  a conclusion  from  the  former,  showing  why  our  Lord 
said,  “Sell  that  ye  have,”  namely,  that  you  may  show  that  your  heart 
is  not  in  your  money  but  in  heaven.  If,  therefore,  you  place  your 
treasure  gained  by  alms-giving  in  heaven,  you  will  show  that  your 
heart  is  fixed  in  heaven,  not  on  earth— in  God,  not  in  gold.  For 
a man’s  treasure  is  that  which  he  loves — holds  dear — values  at  a 
great  price,  on  which  he  rests  his  hopes.  See  Matt  vi.  20. 

Verses  35,  36. — Let  your  loins  be  girded  about,  and  your  lights 
burning ; and  ye  yourselves  like  unto  men  that  wait  for  their  lord 
when  he  will  return  from  the  wedding.  The  Syriac  says,  “ Let  your 
loins  be  girded  and  your  lamps  burning.”  So  the  Arabic,  Egyp- 
tian, iFthiopic  and  Persian.  Christ  had  said  that  it  pleased  the 
Father  to  give  them  the  kingdom.  Sell  therefore  what  you  possess, 
and  give  alms,  that  you  may,  by  this  means,  purchase  this  kingdom. 
He  now  urges  them  diligently  to  prepare  for  it  as  being  at  hand, 
and  girding  their  loins,  and  casting  aside  every  care,  to  enter  upon 
and  take  possession  of  it.  That  is,  Be  you  prepared  and  furnished 
with  all  graces,  and  good  works,  and  merits,  especially  almsgiving 
and  contempt  of  riches,  that  when  Christ  our  Lord  from  heaven, 
and  His  heavenly  marriage  and  joys,  returns  to  you  in  death  to 
judge  your  souls,  you  may  meet  Him  and  be  found  worthy  by  Him 
of  heaven,  and  be  brought  thither  by  Him.  He  alludes  to  the 
Eastern  custom  as  among  the  Hebrews  and  Syrians,  of  wearing  long

robes,  which  they  used  to  tuck  up  when  travelling  or  at  work,  that 
they  might  not  be  in  their  way.  (1  Kings  xviii.  46 ; Tobit  v.  5.) 

Mystically . We  gird  our  loins  when  we  restrain  the  luxury  of  the 
flesh  by  abstinence  (continentiam),  says  S.  Gregory  (Horn,  xiii.),  and 
S.  Augustine  (serm,  xxxix.  dc  Verb . Dom.\  S.  Basil  on  Isa.  xv.,  Bede, 
and  others.  Chrysologus  (serm.  xxiv.)  says,  “ He  commands  us  to 
gird  our  loins  by  the  belt  of  purity,  and  to  bind  our  whole  body  in 
the  zone  of  virtue,  that  we  may  go  forth  quickly  and  expeditiously  to 
meet  our  Lord  at  His  coming.” 

We  may  either  unite  the  two  verses  35  and  36  into  one,  with  Mal- 
donatus,  making  them  contain  one  and  the  same  parable,  or  we 
may  disjoin  them  like  Jansenius  so  as  to  make  them  contain  two — 
one,  the  lamps  burning ; the  other,  the  servants  expecting  their  lord 
from  the  wedding. 

Hence  this  sentence  is  differently  explained  by  different  persons, 
for  those  who  gird  themselves  are  divers — workmen,  ministers,  tra- 
vellers, messengers,  soldiers,  porters,  eremites,  and  their  girdles  are 
divers.  Workmen  are  girt  with  the  girdle  of  labour — ministers,  of 
their  ministry — travellers  and  messengers,  of  the  road — soldiers,  of 
warfare,  whose  is  the  girdle  of  hardness — porters,  of  constancy  and 
patience— eremites,  of  abstinence,  mortification,  and  penance. 

Firstly,  Of  labourers  girding  their  loins  to  their  work,  Theophylact 
speaks  thus : 44  Be  your  loins  girded ; ” that  is,  be  ye  ready  in  all  ways 
for  the  work  of  your  Lord,  “ and  your  lamps  burning  in  your  hands ; h 
— that  is,  labour  not  in  the  dark  and  without  judgment,  but  take  the 
light  of  the  word,  which  will  show  you  what  is  and  what  is  not  to 
be  done — for  this  world  is  night”  So  Euthymius  and  Titus,  meaning, 
44  Be  you  ready  to  every  good  work.” 

Secondly,  Of  those  who  minister  to  Christ  and  those  who  are 
poor  through  almsgiving  (to  which  the  words  immediately  pre- 
ceding apply)  some  explain  it  as  follows — Gird  up  your  loins,  that 
you  may  be  swift  and  nimble  to  minister  to  Christ  and  His  poor. 
On  this  subject  there  is  related  a notable  vision  in  the  life  of  John 
the  almsgiver,  who  was  always  very  ready  to  give  to  any  one  who 
asked  alms  of  him  (chap,  xxix.),  when  a certain  noble  was  slower

than  usual  in  giving  a loan,  he  was  taught  by  a vision  of  a hundred- 
fold remuneration  to  be  quicker. 

Thirdly,  Of  travellers  girding  up  their  loins  for  a journey.  Some 
explain  it  thus  : Gird  up  your  loins,  that  you  may  be  expeditious  on 
your  journey  to  heaven,  from  which  the  Word  has  gone  before,  for 
a grand  way  to  it  remains  for  you.  S.  Peter,  Epist.  i,  chap . i. 
13-15,  alludes  to  the  exodus  (hence  called  Pasch)  of  the  Israelites, 
from  Egypt  into  the  promised  land,  which  was  a figure  of  the  saints 
passing  from  earth  into  heaven.  For  God  thus  commanded  and 
directed  the  Hebrews  in  the  eating  of  the  paschal  lamb  which  was 
to  be  sacrificed  for  their  happy  journey.  “Thus  shall  ye  eat  it, 
with  your  loins  girded,  your  shoes  on  your  feet  and  your  staff  in 
your  hand  ” (as  if  girded  to  begin  a journey),  “ and  ye  shall  eat  it  in 
haste:  it  is  the  Lord’s  passover.  The  same  has  to  be  done  by 
Christians  in  mystery.  See  what  I have  said  thereon. 

Fourthly,  Messengers  and  legates  gird  their  loins  that  they  may  be 
the  swifter  in  performing  their  office.  The  angels  who  are  the  mes- 
sengers of  God,  are  therefore  painted  with  their  loins  girded  to  show 
that  they  are  swift  and  nimble  to  perform  the  commandments  of 
God  ; according  to  the  words,  “ Who  maketh  His  angels  winds,  and 
His  ministers  a flame  of  fire.”  Heb.  i.  7.  Christ  therefore  says,  “ O 
ye  apostles  and  disciples,  gird  ye  your  loins,  that  you  may  be  my 
messengers  throughout  the  whole  world — proclaiming  the  faith  of 
the  Gospel  to  Greeks,  Romans,  Italians,  Gauls,  Spaniards,  Indians, 
Brazilians,  Japanese,  Chinese,  &c  Behold  I send  you  : Go  ye  there- 
fore, eagerly,  swiftly,  and  ardently  like  angels,”  as  Isaiah,  “ Go  ye 
swift  messengers  to  a nation  scattered  and  peeled”  xviiL  2,  and 
lii.  7,  which  S.  Paul  cites  to  the  Romans,  x.  1 5,  “ How  beautiful 
upon  the  mountains  are  the  feet  of  him  that  bringeth  good  tidings, 
that  publisheth  peace.” 

Fifthly,  Soldiers  and  athletes  gird  their  loins  that  they  may  fight 
with  more  strength  and  courage.  So  do  you  also,  O Christians,  gird 
your  loins  with  the  girdle  of  strength  and  fortitude,  that  as  ministers 
of  Christ  you  may  fight  boldly  against  the  devil,  the  flesh,  and  the 
world,  and  conquer  and  triumph,  as  S.  Paul  to  the  Ephesians,  “ Stand

therefore,  having  girded  your  loins  with  truth  and  having  put  on  the 
breastplate  of  righteousness.11  On  which  I have  commented  at 
length.  David  also  : “ Thou  hast  girded  me  with  strength  unto  the 
battle,”  Ps.  xviii.  39;  and  Job,  “Gird  up  now  thy  loins  like  a man” 
xxxviii.  3 ; and  Ex.  xii.  n,  “ Your  loins  girded,”  for  they  went  armed 
as  to  take  possession  of  the  promised  land.  Hence  Origen  (ham.  ix. 
in  lib . Judic.)  thinks  that  allusion  is  here  made  to  the  army  of  Gideon 
who  went  up  girded  against  the  Midianites  (Judg.  vil). 

Sixthly,  The  porters,  that  they  may  be  strong  to  carry  heavy 
burthens,  gird  their  loins.  So,  O ye  faithful,  do  ye  gird  your  loins 
with  the  girdle  of  patience  that  you  may  bear  all  adverse  accidents 
with  nobleness.  So  Cyril,  in  the  Catena , “ Be  ye  prompt  to  bear 
misfortunes.” 

Seventhly,  The  continent,  that  they  may  overcome  the  flesh  and 
esist  with  success  all  the  wicked  incitements  of  lust,  gird  themselves 
with  the  girdle  of  continence,  that  is  of  self-abnegation  and  morti- 
fication, by  which  they  reject  all  the  wicked  desires  that  are  con- 
tinually arising  from  concupiscence — and  refuse  them,  and  mortify 
them,  and  cut  them  off.  So  Simeon  the  Stylite.  He  tortured  him- 
self to  such  a degree  by  a knotted  cord  that  the  head  (praefectus) 
of  his  monastery  undid  it,  and  dismissed  him  from  the  monastery, 
lest  the  weaker  brethren  should  endeavour  to  follow  his  example, 
and  from  their  failure  become  a disgrace.  We  have  this  from  his 
disciple  S.  Antony,  and  from  Theodoret,  in  their  lives  of  him. 

And  your  lamps  burning . Christ  commanded  us  to  be  ready, 
with  loins  girt,  for  good  works,  and  for  our  passage  to  heaven.  He 
now  fitly  requires  our  lamps  to  be  burning,  for  these  are  needed  by 
night  whether  for  work  or  for  taking  a journey.  For  this,  our  life, 
is  a mystical  night,  and  is  full  of  ignorance,  errors,  and  the  darkness 
of  concupiscence  ; so  that  we  have  need  of  light  and  lighted  lamps, 
that  we  travel  on  in  that  night  and  perform  our  work.  He  alludes 
especially  to  the  marriage  feast,  which  was  celebrated  at  night  with 
torches.  That  is,  as  in  the  night-time  the  servants  await  their  lord 
on  his  return  from  his  marriage  with  lighted  torches,  and  go  before 
him,  so  do  ye  watch  and  await  me  as  I return  to  you  from  heaven

by  death,  and  go  before  me  with  spiritual  torches,  for  you  know  not 
the  day  and  hour  of  your  death  and  the  coming  of  Christ  to  judg- 
ment If  you  know  this  you  will  be  prepared  and  expect  Him  every 
hour,  for  so  the  virgins  with  their  lamps  lighted  await  the  bride- 
groom. Matt  xxv.  This  parable  of  Luke  is  mostly  the  same  as 
that  of  Matthew. 

If  it  be  asked  what  the  lighted  lamps  signify,  Theophylact  answers, 
“ Firstly,  they  signify  that  we  ought  to  have  the  light  of  reason  and 
discretion  to  distinguish  what  we  ought  to  do  and  how  we  ought  to 
do  it ; and  secondly,  we  should  have  faith,  burning  with  love  and 
fervour  of  spirit,  for  this  will  show  us  what  to  do  and  what  to  avoid, 
will  urge  us  to  lofty  acts  of  virtue  and  incite  us  to  teach  others  the 
way  of  faith  and  salvation,  and  inspire  them  with  the  love  of  God, 
and  not  suffer  any  to  live  in  the  darkness  of  ignorance  and  sin.” 
So  S.  Augustine  {serm.  xxxix.)  on  the  words  of  the  Lord ; and  so 
S.  Jerome,  or  whoever  is  the  author,  on  Jeremiah  L,  who  says,  “that 
to  hold  a lamp  in  the  hand  is  the  same  as  to  preach  the  Gospel.” 

Mystically.  “These  things”  says  Ccelestine,  “have  their  own 
mysteries.  For  in  the  girding  of  the  loins  is  shown  purity : in  the 
staff,  pastoral  rule;  in  the  lighted  lamps,  the  brightness  of  good  works” 
(Ep.  ii.  ad  Episc.  Gall.)  S.  Gregory  also,  in  his  13th  homily,  under- 
stands, by  the  shining  lamps,  good  examples.  We  hold  lighted 
lamps  in  our  hands,  he  says,  when  by  our  good  works  we  show 
examples  of  light  to  our  neighbours.  Two  things  are  commanded 
us,  to  have  our  loins  girded  and  our  lamps  lighted,  as  are  inno- 
cence and  purity  of  body,  and  the  light  of  truth  in  our  actions, 
for  purity  is  of  little  value  without  a good  life,  or  a good  act  without 
chastity. 

S.  Augustine  again  {Lib.  ii.  Quasi.  Evan.)\  “Girt  loins  means 
abstinence  from  secular  affairs,  lighted  lamps,  the  doing  of  the  same 
thing  with  a true  object  and  right  intention.”  “The  lighted  lamps,” 
says  S.  Maximus,  “are  prayer,  contemplation,  and  spiritual  love.” 
Lastly,  Origen  {Horn.  9 on  Judges)  thinks  that  allusion  is  here  made 
to  the  torches  of  the  army  of  Gideon,  and  that  as  their  sudden  dis- 
covery terrified  the  Midianites,  so  the  apostles  and  martyrs,  when

their  bodies  had  been  shattered  and  broken  by  martyrdom,  began 
to  shine  forth  by  their  miracles,  by  which  the  persecutors  were  put  to 
flight,  and  thus  their  doctrine  and  holiness  shone  throughout  the 
world.  As  is  clearly  explained  by  Bede  in  his  questions  on  the 
book  of  Judges,  and  Gregory  at  length,  30  Moral . chap . xxxil,  and 
following ; see  Judges  vii 

In  your  hands . These  words  are  not  found  in  the  Greek,  Syriac, 
and  Arabic ; nor  in  the  Greek  Fathers,  Origen,  Clement,  Cyril,  Chry- 
sostom, S.  Basil,  Titus;  nor  in  the  Latins,  S.  Ambrose,  Cyprian, 
Hilary,  and  Augustine  ( Serm . xxxix.)  But  S.  Gregory  has  them  in 
his  13th  Homily,  Irenaeus  (lib.  iv.  cap . 72),  and  S.  Jerome,  on  Eph. 
xvi.  and  Jer.  i.,  as  also  the  codices  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  cor- 
rected at  Rome.  “ In  your  hands,”  therefore,  means  in  your  posses- 
sion, that  they  may  shed  light  on  your  works.  Again,  it  means, 
that  with  their  lamps  in  their  hands  they  should  go  as  His  servants 
to  meet  Christ  their  Lord.  From  these  words  of  Christ  has  arisen 
the  custom  of  placing  in  the  hands  of  the  faithful,  when  in  their  last 
agony,  lighted  and  blessed  candles  of  wax,  to  show  that  they  are 
going  to  meet  Christ  with  faith  and  burning  love  and  to  excite 
them  to  it  So  Amalarius,  RabaHus  and  others  who  have  written 
on  Ecclesiastical  Offices. 

S.  Cyril  adds,  in  his  fourth  book  on  Worshipping  in  Spirit  and 
in  Truth,  “ Having  your  feet  shod ; ” but  no  other  has  it,  and  there- 
fore S.  Cyril  seems  to  have  inadvertently  copied  it  from  S.  Paul, 
Eph.  vL  15. 

Ver.  36. — And  be  ye  yourselves  like  unto  men  looking  for  their  lord. 
This  is  the  third  precept  of  Christ,  or  rather  the  third  part  of  the 
same  precept  The  first  was  to  have  their  loins  girt,  the  second 
to  have  their  lights  shining,  the  third  to  look  for  their  lord.  The 
first  two  are  referred  to  this.  The  meaning  is,  Be  you  so  prepared 
and  ready  as  servants  who  expect  their  lord  by  night,  that  is,  watch- 
ful, with  loins  girt  and  lamps  burning.  Hence  Maldonatus  thinks 
that  this  parable  is  one  and  identical,  but  consisting  of  three  parts. 
Jansenius  thinks  that  it  is  diverse ; but  it  comes  to  the  same  thing, 

for,  as  I have  said,  this  is  another  and  the  third  part  of  the  parable 

VOL.  vi.  u

S.  LUKE,  C.  XII. 


to  which  the  other  two  tend  and  are  directed.  “ They  await  their 
lord  ” says  Toletus,  “ as  those  who,  thinking  themselves  strangers, 
bum  with  the  desire  for  Christ,  and  frequently,  nay,  continually  think 
of  Him — have  their  minds  fixed  on  Him ; for  His  love  and  hope 
bear  adversity  and  all  kinds  of  calamities  with  patience;  fear  to 
offend  Him  as  having  Him  at  length  come  to  them,  before  their 
eyes;  despise  without  difficulty  whatever  does  not  make  for  His 
coming ; delight  in  whatever  they  know  to  be  pleasing  to  Him ; 
hold  temporal  things  of  small  account  because  of  their  hope  of 
eternal  ones.” 

Symbolically , The  above  words,  “Let  your  loins  be  girded  and 
your  lamps  burning,  and  be  ye  yourselves  like  unto  men  look- 
ing for  their  lord,”  teach  us  (i.)  That  here  we  are  as  strangers 
journeying  on  to  the  heavenly  kingdom,  (a.)  That  we  ought  to 
outshine  all  others  in  virtue.  (3.)  That  we  should  fix  our  hopes 
on  the  heavens,  according  to  the  words  of  1 S.  Peter  il  n,  12,  and  1 
i.  13. 

Again,  S.  Augustine  (serm.  39  de  Verbis  Domini ),  asserts  that  these 
are  the  three  subjects  on  which  S.  Paul  exhorted  Felix  (Acts  xxiv.) 
“ Paul/  he  says,  “taught  continence,  justice,  and  eternal  life,  for  in 
these  is  contained  the  sum  of  the  evangelical  life.”  Secondly,  in 
them  are  shown  the  three  duties  of  the  apostolic  life : Firstly,  the 
loins  girded  show  that  the  Apostles  were  sent  by  Christ  to  preach 
the  gospel  through  the  whole  world,  and  also  to  contend  against  all 
evil  spirits,  tyrannical  rulers,  unbelievers,  and  vices,  according  to 
the  words  of  S.  Luke,  “ I have  given  you  authority  to  tread  upon 
serpents  and  scorpions,  and  over  all  the  power  of  the  enemy.” 
Secondly,  The  burning  lamps  shew  those  who  ought  to  illuminate 
the  world  by  their  doctrine  and  preaching,  according  to  the  words, 
“Ye  are  the  light  of  the  world,”  Matt  v.  14.  Thirdly,  “Be  like 
unto  men  looking  for  their  lord.”  This  signifies  those  who  ought 
to  despise  and  tread  under  foot  this  present  world  and  all  things 
belonging  to  it,  and  to  lead  a heavenly  and  divine  life,  that  their 
minds  and  hearts  may  be  fixed  on  heaven,  as  in  Phil.  iii.  20,  “ Our 
citizenship  is  in  heaven.”  S.  Paul  adds  the  result,  the  fruit,  and

the  reward  : “ From  whence  also  we  wait  for  a Saviour,  the  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  who  shall  fashion  anew  the  body  of  our  humiliation,  that  it 
may  be  conformed  to  the  body  of  His  glory.”  That  is,  We  despise 
earthly  things,  we  seek  for  heavenly  ones,  because  we  look  with  a 
certain  hope  for  Christ,  who  shall  beautify  and  make  us  glorious  for 
ever.  So  Toletus. 

These  three  things  the  early  Christians  always  kept  rooted  in  their 
minds,  who  as  strangers  upon  earth  and  citizens  of  heaven  willingly 
poured  out  their  wealth,  their  honours,  their  pleasures,  their  very 
present  life  itself  for  Christ,  because  they  surely  looked  for  the 
coming  of  the  Lord  Christ  after  this  short  life,  and  for  a happy  and 
eternal  one  to  be  given  to  them  by  Him,  which  indeed  is  true 
wisdom  and  prudence.  We  may  see  this  in  the  Pontiffs,  Virgins, 
Roman  Martyrs  for  three  hundred  years,  from  S.  Peter  to  Silvester, 
all  of  whom  rejoiced  in  ceaseless  persecutions,  rejoiced  to  be  spoiled 
of  their  goods,  to  be  imprisoned,  scourged,  slain,  burnt,  that  they 
might  enjoy  (possess)  Christ  in  heaven.  Eminent  amongst  others 
was  S.  Cecilia,  who,  when  flourishing  in  youth,  beauty,  wealth, 
nobility,  of  her  own  will  most  gladly  gave  up  all  things  for  Christ 
and  even  her  life  itself,  in  the  midst  of  wondering,  pitying,  and 
lamenting  friends,  and  went  joyfully  and  exultingly  to  the  place  of 
martyrdom,  saying,  “ This  is  not  to  lose  my  youth  but  to  change  it ; 
this  is  to  give  clay  and  receive  in  return  gold ; to  give  a vile  and 
miserable  hovel  and  receive  a palace  most  spacious,  lofty,  and 
magnificent,  built  of  precious  stones  and  gold ; to  give  a perish- 
able thing  and  receive  one  that  knows  no  end  and  is  subject  to 
no  death and  soon  after,  “ Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  does  not  give 
pound  for  pound,  but  what  He  gives  as  a simple  sum  He  returns 
a hundredfold,  and  adds  besides  eternal  life.”  Thus  is  it  in 
her  Acts. 

The  life  of  a Christian  then  should  be  nothing  but  one  looking 
for  the  coming  of  Christ,  that  He  may  deliver  him  from  this  life, 
which  is  so  vile  and  miserable  and  subject  to  so  many  fears  and 
perils,  and  bring  him  to  His  own  kingdom  in  the  heavens  and  to 
eternal  life.  And  hence  the  prophets  and  Paul  teach  everywhere

that  the  faithful  ought  to  live  In  such  holiness  and  contempt  of  the 
things  of  this  world,  as  to  look  eagerly  and  with  avidity  to  the  coming 
of  Christ  So  the  patriarch  Jacob  when  dying  and  longing  for  the 
coming  of  Christ,  “ I have  waited  for  Thy  salvation,  O Lord,”  Gen. 
xlix.  18;  and  Job,  “All  the  days  of  my  appointed  time  I will  wait 
till  my  change  come,”  xiv.  14;  and  the  Psalms,  “I  have  waited 
patiently  for  the  Lord,”  xl  1,  and  “ Wait  on  the  Lord,  be  of  good 
courage,  and  He  shall  strengthen  thine  heart,  wait,  I say,  on  the 
Lord,”  xxvil  14  (Bib.  version).  Isa.  viil  17,  “I  will  wait  upon  the 
Lord ; ” and  xxv.  9,  “ We  have  waited  for  Him,  and  He  will  save  us. 
This  is  the  Lord,  we  have  waited  for  Him,  we  will  be  glad  and  rejoice 
in  His  salvation.”  Jeremiah,  Lam.  iii.  24,  “ The  Lord  is  my  por- 
tion, therefore  will  I wait  for  Him;”  Micah  vil  7,  “I  will  look 
unto  the  Lord,  I will  wait  for  the  God  of  my  salvation.”  So  Joseph 
of  Arimathaea,  despising  all  fear  of  the  Jews,  buried  Christ  because 
“he  was  looking  for  the  kingdom  of  God,”  Luke  xxiiL  51.  S.  Paul 
to  the  Romans,  “The  earnest  expectation  of  the  creation  waiteth 
for  the  revealing  of  the  sons  of  God,”  viii.  19 ; and  23,  “ Ourselves 
also,  which  have  the  firstfhiits  of  the  Spirit,  even  we  ourselves  groan 
within  ourselves,  waiting  for  our  redemption,  to  wit,  the  redemption 
of  our  body ; ” GaL  v.  5,  “ We  wait  for  the  hope  of  righteousness ; ” 
Phil  iii.  20,  “We  wait  for  a Saviour Titus  ii.  12,  13,  “We  should 
live  soberly  and  righteously  and  godly  in  this  present  world,  look- 
ing for  the  blessed  hope  and  appearing  of  the  glory  of  our  great 
God;”  2 S.  Peter  iii.  11,  “Seeing  that  these  things  are  thus  all  to 
be  dissolved,  what  manner  of  persons  ought  ye  to  be,  in  all  holy  living 
and  godliness,  looking  for  and  earnestly  desiring  the  coming  of  the 
day  of  God  ?”  and  ver.  13,  14,  “ But  according  to  His  promise  we 
look  for  new  heavens  and  a new  earth,  wherein  dwelleth  righteous- 
ness. Wherefore,  beloved,  seeing  that  ye  look  for  these  things,  give 
diligence  that  ye  may  be  found  in  peace  without  spot  and  blameless 
in  His  sight”  Climacus  ( degradu ) says,  “ He  is  righteous  who  fears 
not  death;  he  is  holy  and  perfect  who  daily  expects  it”  So  S. 
Francis  expected  the  Lord  when  he  recited,  as  he  was  dying,  the 
words  of  the  Psalm,  “The  righteous  shall  compass  me  about,  for

THE  SAINTS’  LONGING  DESIRE  TO  SEE  GOD.  309 

Thou  shalt  deal  righteously  with  me”  (Ps.  cxlii.  7),  and  so  died. 
And  S.  Bernard  rejoiced — 

Desidero  te  millies,  A thousand  fold  I long  for  Thee, 

Mi  Jesu  quando  venies,  When,  Jesu,  wilt  Thou  come  to  me  ? 

Me  lsetum  quando  facies  ? When  shall  I be,  O Lord,  set  free  ? 

Me  de  te  quando  saties  ? And  with  Thyself  full  sated  be  ? 

Memorable  and  dreadful  is  the  description  of  S.  Bridget,  in  her 
Fourth  Book  of  Revelations,  chap.  vii. : “ In  Purgatory  there  is  a 
third  and  higher  place  where  is  no  other  punishment  than  the  desire 
of  coming  to  God  and  of  His  beatific  vision.  They  are  there  tor- 
mented who,  in  this  life,  had  not  a perfect  desire  of  coming  to  the 
presence  of  God  and  of  enjoying  the  vision  of  Him.”  Bede  men- 
tions a like  place  in  Purgatory  {Hist.  v.  13),  and  S.  Gregory  {Dialogues 
iv.  36),  and  Dionysius  the  Carthusian  in  his  {Dialogue  de  Judicio 
partic . artic.  xxxi.),  and  Bellarmine  {De  Purg \ ii.  6).  For  there  is  a 
sort  of  unworthy  idea  and  undervaluing  of  the  great  vision  and 
glory  of  God  because  it  is  not  desired  by  the  faithful  and  the  saints 
with  ardour.  This  is  a sign  that  they  did  not  sufficiently  consider  His 
riches  and  joys  and  weigh  and  ponder  them  ; as  is  to  be  expected. 

Live  then,  O Christian,  to  thy  Christ,  not  to  the  world ; live  to 
the  Spirit,  not  to  the  flesh — live  not  to  time  but  to  eternity. 

When  He  shall  return  from  the  marriage  feast  This  appears  to 
be  an  addition  to  the  parable,  and  not  to  be  applied  of  necessity  to 
what  is  signified  by  it.  It  may  be  applied  thus : Christ  in  His 
Incarnation  celebrated  His  espousals  with  the  Church  and  all  the 
faithful  When  He  went  up  into  heaven  He  there  consummated 
His  marriage  with  the  same  Church,  because  by  the  glory  of  the 
beatific  vision  He  is  intimately  and  indivisibly  united  to  all  the 
Blessed  through  all  eternity.  When,  then,  He  returns  from  the 
heavens  to  judgment,  He  appears  to  return  from  His  heavenly 
marriage  that  He  may  introduce  His  new  bride  to  it.  His  marriage 
then  is  the  highest  union  and  the  highest  joy  that  Christ  has  with 
the  beatified  in  heaven.  So  S,  Gregory,  Bede,  Theophylact,  Euthy- 
mius,  Toletus,  and  others. 

That  when  He  cometh  and  knocketh  they  may  straightway  open  unto

Him.  Christ  here  shows  us  that  we  ought  to  make  our  virtues 
ready  in  this  life,  that  adorned  by  them  in  our  death,  we  may  go 
out  with  joy  and  rejoicing  to  meet  Him,  for  there  will  be  no  time 
then  for  working,  scarcely  even  for  repentance ; for  the  senses  will 
be  dulled  and  the  mind  oppressed  by  disease  and  scarcely  able  to 
think  of  its  sins  and  its  salvation.  They,  then,  act  with  the  utmost 
recklessness  who,  in  this  life,  indulge  in  pleasures  and  say  that  they 
will  repent  on  their  deathbeds — for  their  repentance  will  then  be 
forced  and  too  late,  and  therefore  will  seldom  be  true,  sincere,  and 
earnest  “The  Lord  cometh,1 ” says  S.  Gregory  (Horn,  xiil)  “when 
He  hastens  to  judgment ; but  He  knocks  (at  the  door)  when  by  the 
ills  of  disease  He  designs  death  to  be  near,  and  we  open  to  Him  at 
once  if  we  receive  Him  with  love.  Whoever  dreads  his  departure 
from  the  body  is  unwilling  to  open  to  the  Judge,  and  fears  to  see 
Him  as  his  Judge  whom  he  knows  that  he  has  despised.  But  he 
who  is  secure  as  to  his  hope  and  works,  immediately  opens,  for  he 
receives  the  Judge  with  joy,  and  when  his  death  is  at  hand  he  grows 
glad  in  the  glory  of  his  reward.” 

Ver.  37. — Blessed  are  those  servants , whom  the  Lord  when  He 
cometh  shall  find  watching.  That  is,  with  their  loins  girt  and  their 
lamps  in  their  hands  and  expecting  Him  as  He  goes  before,  for  He 
will  give  them  their  due  reward,  eternal  blessedness,  that  they  may 
enjoy  the  vision  of  God  and  all  glory  and  joy  for  ever  and  ever. 
Hence  the  following  explanation. 

Verify,  I say  unto  you,  that  He  shall  gird  Himself,  and  make  them 
sit  down  to  meat,  and  shall  come  and  serve  them.  Christ  renders  like 
for  like — to  those  of  His  who  are  girt  in  heaven,  He  will  gird 
Himself  in  heaven — He  will  serve  His  own  servants.  Those  who 
have  laboured  in  His  service  He  will  make  to  rest,  and  be  at 
ease,  and  sup,  and  to  those  who  minister  to  Him,  He  Himself,  the 
King  of  kings  and  Lord  of  lords,  will  minister  with  wonderful 
condescension. 

Shall  come.  The  attendants  and  sponsi  used  to  go  round  the 
tables  to  see  if  any  one  needed  anything,  that  he  might  be  supplied. 
The  above  words,  it  is  plain,  are  to  be  taken  as  parables  not  in  the

THE  REWARD  OF  THE  FAITHFUL. 


311 

letter.  For  in  heaven  there  are  no  girdles,  nor  persons  girded,  nor 
tables,  nor  sittings  at  meat,  nor  any  who  come  or  minister : Christ 
only  intends  to  say,  Firstly,  that  he  who  is  pre-eminent  before  all 
other  good  masters,  and  immeasurably  greater,  will  show  honour  to 
His  faithful  servants  in  heaven,  so  as  to  make  them,  from  slaves, 
become  as  lords  with  whom  He  may  share  His  marriage  feast,  that 
is,  the  happiness  and  glory  of  heaven.  Secondly,  That  He  will  do 
it  with  an  endless  number  of  dishes,  that  is,  pleasure  and  delights 
both  of  soul  and  body.  Thirdly,  He  will  see  that  no  one  wants 
anything : not  necessaries  merely,  but  even  luxuries,  and  whatever 
he  wants  and  wishes  for.  Everything  wished  for,  nay,  that  can 
possibly  be  wished  for,  shall  be  supplied  in  superabundance  accord- 
ing to  the  words  “ I shall  be  satisfied  when  I wake  up  with  Thy 
likeness,”  Ps.  xvii.  15  ; and  “They  shall  be  abundantly  satisfied  with 
the  fatness  of  Thy  house,”  Ps.  xxxvi.  8.  Fourthly,  That  He  will 
give  to  each  according  to  his  merits  this  delicacy  and  that,  for  the 
words  “ He  shall  come  ” signify  that  there  shall  be  a supper  varied 
and  most  abundant  according  to  the  merits  of  each ; and  (those) 
“ shall  serve  ” (show)  that  it  shall  be  most  honourable,  and  the  words 
“ shall  make  them  sit  down,”  says  Toletus,  “ shows  that  it  shall  be 
eternal.” 

He  shall  gird  Himself.  “ God  is  girded,”  says  Theophylact,  “ not 
as  giving  us  the  outpouring  of  all  good  things,  for  He  moderates 
them.  For  who  is  able  to  contain  all  that  God  is  ? ” This  is  seen 
from  the  seraphim  who  cover  their  eyes  because  of  the  brightness 
of  the  Divine  light. 

And  make  them  sit  down  to  meat.  S.  Dionysius  the  Areopagite, 
Epistle  9 to  Titus,  says,  “The  sitting  at  meat  we  consider  to  be 
rest  from  many  labours,  a life  of  safety  and  a divine  kind  of  existence 
in  the  light  and  country  of  the  living,  full  of  all  kinds  of  holy  pleasure, 
with  an  abundant  supply  of  all  kinds  of  good  things  by  which  we 
are  supplied,  with  Jesus  rejoicing  over  them  and  placing  them  at 
His  table  and  ministering  to  them  and  giving  them  eternal  life,  fully 
bestowing  upon  them  and  pouring  into  them  all  things  good.” 

Symbolically , S.  Gregory  ( Horn . 13)  says,  f‘  He  will  gird  Himself,  that

S.  LUKE,  C.  XII. 


is,  He  will  prepare  for  the  recompense  and  make  them  sit  down — 
or,  be  refreshed  by  everlasting  rest.  For  to  sit  down  is  to  rest 
in  the  kingdom.  The  Lord  again  says,  “ They  shall  sit  down  with 
Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob.”  The  Lord  will  come  and  minister, 
for  He  satiates  us  with  the  brightness  of  His  light  “Come”  is 
said  of  Him  when  He  returns  to  His  kingdom  for  the  Judgment ; 
for  the  Lord  has  certainly  returned  to  us  since  the  judgment,  because 
from  the  form  of  His  Humanity  He  has  raised  us  to  the  contempla- 
tion of  His  Divinity,  and  He  comes  to  lead  us  to  the  contemplation 
of  His  brightness,  when  Him  whom  we  see  in  the  judgment  in  His 
Humanity,  we  shall  behold,  after  the  judgment,  in  His  Divinity. 

Ver.  38. — And  if  He  shall  come  in  the  second  watch,  and  if  in  the 
third,  and  find  them  so,  blessed  are  those  servants . The  first  watch 
begins  in  the  evening  at  the  beginning  of  night,  and  lasts  three  hours. 
The  second  then  begins  and  lasts  till  midnight  Then  follows  the 
third,  which  also  lasts  for  three  hours ; then  the  fourth,  which  lasts  till 
the  dawn  and  the  rising  of  the  sun.  Christ  shows  by  these  watches 
when  we  ought  to  watch  and  be  prepared  for  the  coming  of  the 
Lord ; for  the  time  of  our  death  is  uncertain,  nor  have  we  one  day 
or  even  hour  of  our  life  of  which  we  can  be  sure.  The  first  watch  is 
our  childhood,  the  second  our  youth,  the  third  our  grown  manhood, 
the  fourth,  our  old  age.  So  Titus  and  S.  Gregory.  “ Christ  does 
not,”  says  F.  Lucas,  " mention  so  much  the  fourth  and  first  watches, 
because  He  does  not  often  come  from  the  marriage  so  early  or  so 
late.  The  marriages  are  generally  concluded  about  the  middle  of 
the  night  when  the  bride  is  conducted  to  the  marriage  chamber. 
Meanwhile,  it  teaches  us  that  we  ought  always  to  watch  even  in 
advanced  age  and  decrepitude,  and  that  it  is  not  enough  to  watch 
only  for  a time,  or  in  youth,  or  in  manhood,  but  we  must  persevere 
as  long  as  this  life  lasts,  because  the  hour  of  our  death  is  uncertain, 
and  also  the  coming  of  our  Lord,  even  though  He  be  long  waited 
for.”  So  S.  Basil  in  his  homily  of  not  regarding  secular  affairs : “ We 
ought  to  be  prepared  daily  to  depart  from  this  life  and  to  await 
the  unchanged  nod  of  God,  that  each,  when  the  Lord  comes  and 
knocks,  may  immediately  open  to  Him.  Christ,  besides,  speaks

"BE  YE  READY  ALSO.” 

only  of  the  second  and  third  watch,  because  sleep  in  them  is  deeper 
and  more  heavy,  to  show  that  He  would  come  when  men  least 
expected  Him ; when  they  were  sunk  in  profound  thoughts  and 
cares,  and,  as  it  were,  were  asleep ; so  that  wise  servants  should  then 
most  especially  watch  and  be  prepared,  that  when  they  seem  to 
themselves  most  healthful  and  prosperous  they  may  look  for  a 
sudden  and  treacherous  death.” 

Toletus  gives  another  reason.  “ Christ,”  he  says,  “ does  not  make 
mention  of  the  fourth  watch  because  there  are  very  few,  who,  having 
put  off  good  works  till  old  age,  are  then  found  to  be  doing  them ; 
and  He  might  have  made  them  tardy  if  He  had  spoken  of  the 
matter.”  From  this  S.  Gregory  concludes  {Horn.  13),  exhorting  all 
men  to  holy  lives,  and  saying,  “ Our  Lord  would  not  reveal  the  last 
hour  to  us,  that  it  might  always  be  looked  for,  and  whilst  we  are 
not  able  to  foresee  it,  that  we  should  without  cessation  be  prepared 
for  it”  Because  then  the  hours  fly  apace,  be  careful,  O most  dear 
brethren,  to  be  occupied  with  the  traffic  of  good  works.  Hear  what 
wise  Solomon  said : “ Whatsoever  thy  hand  findeth  to  do,  do  it  with 
thy  might,  for  there  is  no  work,  nor  device,  nor  knowledge,  nor 
wisdom  in  the  grave  whither  thou  goest.”  Because  then  we  know 
not  the  time  of  our  death,  and  cannot  work  after  it,  we  ought  to 
seize  the  time  allowed  us  before  its  arrival.  Thus,  by  our  being 
always  in  fear  of  it  will  death  itself  be  vanquished. 

Ver.  41. — And  Peter  said , Lord \ speakest  Thou  this  parable  unto  us 
or  even  unto  all  f To  all  men,  especially  the  faithful,  as  well  to  those 
who  are  now  living  as  to  those  who  shall  live  hereafter.  Peter 
doubted  of  this,  because  Christ  was  accustomed  to  give  some  doc- 
trines to  the  Apostles  alone,  others  to  all  the  faithful,  and  He  had 
here  said  some  things  which  seemed  fitted  only  to  the  Apostles 
and  men  of  perfect  lives,  as  verses  32-37.  The  rest  about  watch- 
ing and  waiting  for  the  coming  of  the  Lord  seemed  to  apply  to  all 
the  faithful. 

Ver.  42. — And  the  Lord  saidt  Who  then  is  that  faithful  and  wise 
steward  whom  his  lord  shall  set  over  his  household  to  give  them  their 
portion  of  food  in  due  season  ? Christ  replied  to  Peter  that  He  spoke

S.  LUKE,  C.  XII. 


indeed  to  all  the  faithful,  but  especially  to  him  and  the  Apostles. 
For  upon  them  were  incumbent  greater  watching  and  care,  that  they 
might  save  not  only  themselves  but  others  of  the  faithful  as  welL 
And  Peter  was  the  steward  whom  Christ  set  over  His  household, 
that  is,  His  Church,  as  also  the  other  Apostles,  according  to  the  words 
of  S.  Paul,  “ Let  a man  so  account  of  us  as  of  ministers  of  Christ 
and  stewards  of  the  mysteries  of  God.” 

That  he  may  give  them  their  measure  of  wheat  in  due  season . 
(The  Vulgate  has  mensuram  tritici,  on  which  Cornelius  comments). 
Our  Lord  alludes  to  the  custom  of  the  ancients,  with  whom  slavery 
was  common  and  severe.  For  servants  had  in  abundance  many 
things  that  Christians  have  now  need  of.  They  put  one  of  the 
slaves  over  the  mancipii,  to  distribute,  every  month,  a measure 
(hence  called  demensus)  of  provisions  and  com,  wheat  perhaps, 
or  barley,  if  they  were  of  inferior  degree,  as  I have  shown  on 
Hosea  iii.  2. 

Secondly,  wheat  (tritici)  may  refer  to  time.  For  it  is  the  duty  of 
a good  steward,  like  Joseph,  when  it  is  the  season  of  wheat  harvest, 
to  dispense  it  frugally  by  measure  to  each  head  of  a family,  that 
it  may  not  be  sold  or  expended  on  the  poor,  and  so  there  be  an 
insufficiency  for  the  household.  I have  explained  the  rest  on  S. 
Matt.  xxiv.  45. 

Observe  the  words  “ steward  ” and  u portion.”  For  a just  steward 
does  not  give  the  same  measure  to  all,  but  to  each  his  own  and 
according  to  his  age,  rank,  and  desert  It  is  the  proper  task  of  a 
steward  to  distribute  what  is  appropriate  to  each.  One  kind  and 
proportion  of  food  is  proper  for  an  infant,  and  another  for  a youth,  a 
third,  for  a full  grown  man,  a fourth,  for  the  aged — one  for  a man, 
another  for  a woman — one  for  a daughter,  another  for  a servant — 
one  for  sons,  another  for  slaves. 

From  this  Christ  mora/iter,  teaches,  Bishops,  Pastors,  Confessors, 
Preachers,  that  they  ought  not  to  set  forth  the  same  food  of  doctrine  to 
all  the  faithful,  nor  (in  general)  speak  of  virtues  to  all  only  in  a general 
way,  but  in  particular  they  should  instil  into  them  such  as  are  fit 
and  proper  to  their  age  and  position.  S.  Paul,  by  his  own  example,

taught  the  praxis  of  this  parable  and  sentence  when  he  gave  one 
kind  of  monition  and  precept  to  sons,  another  to  fathers,  another 
to  servants,  Eph.  vi.  1 and  following,  and  when  he  wrote  to  Timothy, 
1 Tim.  v.  1-4 ; so  to  Titus,  iL  2,  and  following. 

S.  Gregory  Thaumaturgus,  Bishop  of  New  Caesarea,  followed  Christ 
and  S.  Paul,  as  Gregory  of  Nyssa  writes  in  his  life  : “ A mourner  would 
hear  from  him  what  would  comfort  him ; youth  were  corrected  and 
taught  moderation — medicine  in  fitting  conversation  was  offered  to 
the  aged,  servants  were  taught  to  be  well  affected  to  their  mastery 
masters  to  be  kind  and  gentle  to  those  under  their  rule ; the  poor 
were  taught  to  hold  grace  the  only  true  riches,  the  possession  of 
which  was  in  the  power  of  every  one ; he  who  boasted  himself  of 
his  wealth  was  aptly  reminded  that  he  was  the  steward  and  not  the 
lord  of  what  he  had.  Profitable  words  were  given  to  women,  suit- 
able ones  to  children,  and  befitting  ones  to  fathers.”  And  S. 
Cyprian,  as  Pontius  the  deacon  wrote  in  his  life,  used  to  urge 
maidens  to  a becoming  rule  of  modesty  and  a manner  of  dress  which 
was  adapted  to  sanctity.  He  taught  the  lapsed  penitence,  heretics 
truth,  schismatics  unity,  the  sons  of  God  peace  and  the  law  of 
evangelical  prayer.  He  comforted  Christians  under  the  loss  of  their 
relatives  with  the  hope  of  the  future.  He  checked  the  bitterness 
of  envy  by  the  sweetness  of  befitting  remedies.  He  incited  martyrs 
by  exhortation  from  the  divine  discourses.  Confessors  who  were 
signed  with  the  mark  on  their  foreheads  he  animated  by  the  incen- 
tive of  the  heavenly  host  The  same,  especially,  and  before  all 
others,  did  Pope  Gregory,  who  kept  the  names  of  all  the  poor  of 
Rome  and  the  neighbourhood  in  a book,  and  supplied  them  with 
whatever  they  required.  He  maintained  three  thousand  nuns  in 
town  and  very  many  more  who  lived  beyond  the  city.  Hence  we 
may  truly  say  of  him,  “ All  the  Church  shall  declare  his  alms,”  Ecclus *. 
xxxiil  How  great  a regard  he  had  for  souls,  and  what  precepts  he 
gave  fitted  for  the  salvation  of  each,  is  seen  from  his  homilies  and 
letters,  in  which  he  admonishes  the  Emperor  Maurice  not  to  with- 
draw soldiers  from  the  Religious  life;  John  the  Patriarch  of  Con- 
stantinople not  to  arrogate  to  himself  the  haughty  title  of  Universal

Bishop ; Venantius  the  Chancellor  of  Italy,  to  resume  the  monastic 
habit  which  he  had  thrown  aside ; John  the  Bishop  of  Ravenna  to 
lay  down  the  Pallium  which  he  had  unlawfully  assumed  Add  to  this 
the  rules  he  gave  and  the  laws  he  laid  down  for  Augustine,  the  Apostle 
of  England,  for  bringing  the  English  to  the  faith  of  Christ ; the  Irish 
bishops  that  he  taught  not  to  re-baptize  those  who  had  been 
baptized  by  heretics  in  the  name  of  the  Trinity,  and  many  other 
things.  Search  the  iv.  voL  of  his  letters  and  you  will  wonder  that 
one  man,  taken  up  with  so  much  business,  and  the  subject  of  so 
many  bodily  infirmities,  could  enter  upon  so  many  and  such  im- 
portant particulars,  and  lay  down  for  each  person  directions  to  fit 
them  for  virtue.  For  prudence  consists  not  in  controlling  general 
acts,  but  in  directing  each  particular  one  wisely ; for  the  performance 
of  virtues  is  singular,  and  requires  a singular  direction  and  teaching. 

Ver.  46. — And  shall  cut  him  asunder.  That  is,  shall  separate  him 
from  Himself,  and  His  household,  the  Church  triumphant;  from 
the  society  of  the  Blessed  and  from  the  Beatitude  promised  to  the 
faithful  servants.  See  St  Jerome  on  Matt  xxiv. : “ Shall  cut  him 
asunder,  that  is,  shall  separate  him  from  the  Communion  of  Saints.” 
St  Hilary:  " Shall  separate  him  from  the  good  promises;”  Origen: 
M Shall  cut  him  off  from  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  from  the  society 
and  guardianship  of  the  Angels,  for  Christ  will  deprive  him  of  all 
grace,  all  virtue,  ail  help,  and  all  hope  of  salvation.” 

And  appoint  his  position  with  the  unfaithful  That  is,  shall  punish 
him  with  the  other  servants  who  were  unfaithful  to  him,  although  they 
pretended  to  be  the  contrary.  Hence  Matt  xxiv.  51  has  “with 
the  hypocrites.”  These  unfaithful  are  perhaps  the  unbelieving — they 
who  would  not  believe  in  Christ,  and  of  whom  it  is  said,  “ He  that 
believeth  not  hath  been  judged  already.”  S.  John  iii.  18. 

Ver.  47. — And  that  servant  which  knew  his  lords  will  and  made 
not  ready . Did  not  prepare  for  the  coming  of  his  lord  by  distribut- 
ing to  his  fellow-servants  their  portions  of  food  in  season,  but  by 
ill-treating  them,  and  by  debauchery,  squandered  the  goods  of  his 
master,  “ he  shall  be  beaten  with  many  stripes.” 

Ver.  48. — But  he  that  kncu*  not , and  did  things  worthy  of  stripes

shall  he  beaten  with  few  stripes.  That  is,  with  fewer  than  he  who 
knew  his  lord's  will,  according  to  the  measure  as  well  of  his  ignorance 
as  of  his  act  and  fault.  There  are  four  degrees  of  ignorance,  the 
first  invincible,  which  is  without  blame;  the  second  vincible,  but 
hardly  so,  which  has  some  fault  and  is  subject  to  punishment ; the 
third  crass,  which  has  more  blame ; the  fourth  wilful,  which  has  the 
most  blame  and  the  heaviest  punishment.  Of  this  the  xxxvi.  Psalm 
speaks,  verse  4,  “ He  deviseth  mischief  upon  his  bed ; he  setteth 
himself  in  a way  that  is  not  good,  he  abhorreth  not  evil.”  “ This 
man,”  says  Euthymius,  “ despised  everything ; that  one  was  slothful. 
But  contempt  is  worse  than  sloth.”  For  the  slothful  man  knew  not 
when  he  might  have  known,  and,  as  Titus  says,  he  neglected  to  learn 
and  despised,  and  derided  contemptuously.  Hence  it  is  plain  against 
Jovinian  and  modem  heretics  that  there  are  degrees  even  of  mortal 
sin,  and  some  are  worse  than  others,  and  will  therefore  meet  with 
more  heavy  punishment  in  hell,  but  one  of  a milder  the  other  of  a 
more  severe  punishment 

And  to  whomsoever  much  is  given — a greater  knowledge  that  is,  and 
recognition  of  his  master's  will — of  him  shall  much  be  required , by  Christ 
the  judge,  and  in  the  particular  as  well  as  general  judgment  For,  as 
S.  Gregory  {Horn.  9)  says,  “ When  gifts  are  increased  the  responsibility 
is  increased  also,”  and  to  whom  they  commit  much  (that  is,  the  care 
and  superintendence  of  souls),  of  him  will  they  ask  the  more . “ Many 
things,”  says  Bede,  “ are  entrusted  to  him,  to  whom  is  committed, 
with  his  own  salvation,  the  salvation  also  of  the  flock  of  God.  From 
such  will  Christ,  His  assessors  the  Apostles,  and  the  other  judges, 
require  the  more,  not  only  their  own  safety  and  salvation  as  far  as 
lies  in  them,  but  those  also  of  the  faithful  committed  to  them.  “ In 
the  pastor,”  says  S.  Bernard,  “ is  required  the  care  of  souls,  not  the 
cure  (cura  requiritur,  non  curatio).  The  latter  may  be  impossible  from 
the  virulence  or  pertinacity  either  of  the  disease  or  of  the  patient.” 
“These  things,”  says  Titus,  “clearly  show  the  judgment  of  the  sur- 
geons and  pastors,  whilst  that  of  the  rest  is  not  less  grave  and  perilous. 
Let  them  not  therefore  show  pride  because  of  their  degree  and  office, 
but  discharge  their  duties  and  feed  their  flocks  with  the  greater

humility,  zeal,  and  diligence.”  “Each  one,  therefore,”  says  S.  Gregory, 
“ ought  to  be  the  more  humble  and  prompt  to  serve  God,  from  the 
office  given  to  him,  as  he  knows  himself  to  be  under  the  greater 
obligation  of  giving  account.” 

Again,  S.  Bernard  {Lib.  iv.  de  Consid.\  lays  down  forcibly,  and  point 
by  point,  to  Pope  Eugenius  III.  what,  and  how  much,  God  requires 
from  Pontiffs,  Bishops,  and  Prelates.  “Consider  thyself,”  he  says,  “as 
the  form  of  justice,  the  mirror  of  holiness — the  exemplar  of  piety — 
the  assertor  of  the  truth,  the  defender  of  the  faith,  the  doctor  of  the 
Gentiles,  the  leader  of  Christians,  the  friend  of  the  bridegroom,  the 
ordainer  of  the  clergy,  the  pastor  of  the  people,  the  governor  of  the 
unwise,  the  refuge  of  the  oppressed,  the  advocate  of  the  poor,  the 
hope  of  the  wretched,  the  tutor  of  the  young,  the  judge  of  widows, 
the  eyes  of  the  blind,  the  tongue  of  the  dumb,  the  staff  of  the  aged, 
the  avenger  of  crimes,  the  dread  of  the  wicked,  the  glory  of  the  good, 
the  rod  of  the  powerful,  the  hammer  of  tyrants,  the  father  of  kings, 
the  judge  of  the  laws,  the  dispenser  of  canonries,  the  salt  of  the 
earth,  the  light  of  the  world,  the  priest  of  the  Most  High,  the  Vicar 
of  Christ  Who  would  not  be  struck  with  fear,  and  tremble,  when 
he  heard  this,  all  of  which  is  required  of  your  see  ? ” Thus  S.  Paul 
to  the  Heb.  xiiL  17,  on  which,  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “I  wonder 
if  any  guardian  of  souls  can  be  saved,”  Cardinal  Bellarmine  said 
the  same  of  Pontiffs.  Hence  wise  and  holy  men  have  avoided  pre- 
lacies, and  have  only  accepted  them  by  compulsion.  S.  Cyprian, 
in  his  Epist.  2,  lib.  iv.,  wrote  thus  of  Cornelius  the  Pontiff : “ He 
did  not  demand  the  popedom  for  himself,  nor  seize  it  by  force,  as 
others  puffed  up  by  their  arrogance  and  pride  have  done,  but 
quietly  and  modestly,  and  like  others  who  have  been  divinely  called 
to  this  office,  he  endured  force  lest  he  should  be  compelled  to 
accept  it”  In  like  manner,  as  far  as  they  could,  SS.  Gregory,  Chry- 
sostom, Ambrose,  Basil,  Nazianzen,  Nicholas,  Athanasius,  shunned 
the  office  of  Bishops ; and  in  our  own  times  Pius  V.,  when  chosen 
Pontiff,  turned  pale  and  almost  fell  into  a faint.  When  asked  the 
reason  he  frankly  answered,  “ When  I was  a Religious  of  the  Order 
of  Benedict,  I had  very  good  hope  of  my  salvation ; when  I was

afterwards  made  a Bishop  I began  to  have  a dread  about  it : now 
that  I am  chosen  Pontiff  I almost  despair  of  it,  for  how  am  I to  give 
account  to  God  for  so  many  thousands  of  souls  as  are  in  this  whole 
city,  when  I can  scarcely  answer  for  my  own  soul  ? * So  it  is  in  his 
life.  Finally,  the  Council  of  Trent  declares  the  burthen  of  a Bishop’s 
office  to  be  one  formidable  to  the  shoulders  of  angels. 

Ver.  49. — I came  to  cast  fire  on  the  earth;  and  what  will  If  if  it  is 
already  kindled  t The  Arabic  has,  “ What  will  I but  that  it  be 
kindled?”  So  the  Egyptian,  Ethiopic,  and  Persian.  It  is  uncertain 
whether  Christ  said  this  at  the  same  time  as  the  preceding.  For 
S.  Luke  joins  the  words  of  Christ  together,  although  spoken  at  dif- 
ferent times.  It  may  be  connected  with  the  preceding  and  following 
thus : Christ  after  much  teaching  of  the  Apostles  and  faithful,  may,  at 
last,  have  stated  the  primary  duty  that  He  was  sent  into  the  world  by 
the  Father  to  fulfil,  namely,  that  He  should  send  fire  from  heaven  on 
the  Apostles,  that  they,  when  inflamed  by  it,  might  kindle  it  in  the 
rest  of  the  other  faithful ; for  by  this  the  Apostles  would  fully  and 
efficaciously  perform  the  work  that  had  been  given  them  by  Christ 
of  evangelising  the  whole  world  and  converting  it  to  Him,  and  the 
faithful  would  exactly  carry  on  the  instructions  of  the  Apostles. 

Symbolically , S.  Ambrose,  on  Ps.  cxix.  (Scrm.  viii.)  says : “ God 
is  a light  to  lighten  and  a fire  to  bum  up  the  chaff  of  men's  vices.” 
“ He  is  light,”  he  says,  “ to  shine  like  a lantern  for  one  who  is  walk- 
ing in  darkness,  so  that  whoever  seeks  it  in  its  brightness  cannot 
err.  He  is  fire  to  consume  the  straw  and  chaff  of  our  works,  as 
gold,  the  more  it  is  refined,  is  better  proved.”  So  Clement  of 
Alexandria  in  his  exhortations  to  the  Gentiles : “ The  Saviour  has 
many  voices  and  methods  of  man’s  salvation.  In  threatening  He 
admonishes;  by  prohibitions  He  converts;  with  tears  He  pities; 
(in  songs)  He  speaks  through  the  cloud ; (in  songs)  by  fire  He 
strikes  terror.  The  flame  is  a mark  at  once  of  grace  and  of  fear. 
If  you  be  obedient  it  is  a light — if  disobedient,  a consuming  fire.” 

It  may  be  asked — What  is  this  fire  ? Firstly,  Tertullian  (Against 
Marcion,  IV.  xxix.),  Maldonatus,  and  F.  Lucas  answer  that  it  is 
hatred,  dissensions,  tribulations,  and  persecutions  by  unbelievers  of

the  faith  and  of  the  Apostles,  and  the  faithful  of  Christ  These, 
indirectly,  and  occasionally,  Christ  and  the  Apostles  raised  by 
preaching  the  Gospel  and  the  new  religion  of  the  crucified  Saviour. 
“Christ,”  says  Tertullian,  “will  better  interpret  the  quality  of  this 
fire,  ver.  51,  1 Think  you  that  I am  come  to  give  peace  in  the  earth  ? 
I tell  you,  Nay,  but  rather  division,  for  there  shall  be  from  hence- 
forth,' &c  Christ  means  then  the  fire  of  destruction  when  He 
refuses  peace : such  as  the  conflict  was,  such  will  the  burning  be  by 
which  Christ  will  overthrow  idolatry  and  all  (manners  of)  wickedness, 
and  will  reduce  them  to  ashes.  Hence  He  would  stir  up  all  the 
nations  that  were  addicted  to  their  own  idols  against  Himself  and 
the  Apostles,  to  extinguish  by  every  means  this  new  instrument  of 
destruction  of  their  ancient  superstition.  To  this  applies  all  that 
Christ  subjoins  in  explanation  of  this  fire,  verses  50-53.” 

Secondly,  and  more  fitly,  S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena , and  Jansenius 
think  this  fire  to  be  the  preaching  of  the  Gospel,  for  Christ  directly 
wished  for  this,  that  by  its  means  He  might  warm  the  hearts  of  men 
by  divine  fire,  as  Ps.  cxix.  140,  “Thy  Word  is  very  pure  ” (Vulgate, 
ignitum). 

Thirdly,  and  best,  S.  Ambrose  and  Origen  on  this  passage,  S. 
Athanasius  on  the  Common  Essence  of  Father  and  Son,  S.  Cyril 
(Book  iv.  on  Leviticus),  S.  Jerome  (Book  il  Apol.  against  Ruffinus), 
S.  Augustine  ( Serm . 108  de  Tempore\  S.  Gregory  (Horn.  30  in  Evang .), 
by  “fire”  understand  the  Holy  Ghost  and  His  gifts,  especially 
charity,  devotion,  fervour,  zeal,  which,  say  Euthymius  and  Theophy- 
lact,  “ He  kindles  in  the  souls  of  the  faithful.”  This  fire  also  kindles 
the  lamps  of  the  faithful,  according  to  the  words,  M Love  is  strong 
as  death,  jealousy  is  cruel  as  the  grave,  the  coals  thereof  are  coals 
of  fire  which  hath  a most  vehement  flame.”  Cant.  viii.  6.  See  what 
has  been  said  thereon.  The  Church  so  explains  it  when  on  the 
Saturday  after  the  Pentecost  she  prays  thus  in  the  Mass,  “ We 
beseech  Thee,  O Lord,  may  the  Holy  Spirit  inflame  us  without  fire 
which  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  sent  upon  earth  and  earnestly  desired 
might  be  enkindled.” 

“ By  this  fire,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ was  Cleophas  incited  when  he

said,  “ Did  not  our  heart  bum  within  us,  while  He  spake  to  us  in 
the  way,  and  while  He  opened  to  us  the  Scriptures?”  Luke  xxiv.  32. 
Thus  this  Are  of  love  and  ardour  embraces  that  of  tribulation  which  has 
the  first  place.  For  this  fire,  the  Apostles,  inflamed  with  the  love  of 
Christ,  overcame ; and  so  provoked  it,  for  it  pressed  upon  them,  as 
Christ  foretold  in  the  following,  xii.  49.  So  said  also  S.  Paul,  “ Who 
shall  separate  us  from  the  love  of  Christ  ? . . . I am  persuaded  that 
neither  death  nor  life,”  Rom.  viiL  35-38.  By  the  same  fire  was 
Ignatius  urged  in  his  Epistle  to  the  Romans:  “I  wish,”  he  said, 
“that  I may  enjoy  the  beasts  that  await  me,  which  I pray  may 
be  swift  for  my  destruction  and  my  punishment,  and  may  be 
allured  to  devour  me.  I am  the  wheat  of  Christ,  to  be  ground  by 
the  teeth  of  beasts,  that  I may  be  found  the  bread  of  the  world.” 
This  desire  Christ  fulfilled  when  He  sent  the  Holy  Spirit  upon  the 
Apostles  and  faithful,  in  the  form  of  tongues  of  fire  at  Pentecost, 
Acts  iL  Upon  which  S.  Chrysostom  says  (Horn,  iv.) : “ This  fire 
has  burnt  up  the  sins  of  the  world  like  fire ; ” and  again,  as  we  may 
suppose : “ As  a man  on  fire  (igneus  homo)  if  he  falls  into  the  midst 
of  stubble  will  not  be  hurt,  but  will  rather  exert  his  strength,  so  it 
happens  here,”  \hat  the  Apostles  as  men  on  fire  with  the  Spirit 
(homines  ignei)  should  not  be  hurt  by  their  persecutors,  but  rather 
convert  them  to  the  faith  of  Christ  and  inflame  them.  See  the  gifts  of 
fire  which  I have  counted  up — enumerated  and  applied  to  the  Love 
of  God,  Levit  be.  23,  and  Acts  xxiii.  and  iL  3,  and  Dionysius  on  the 
Ecclesiastical  Hierarchy  xv.,  where  he  shows  by  many  analogies 
that  fire  is  the  most  apt  symbol  and  hieroglyphic  of  God  and  the 
angels,  and  most  fitly  represents  their  similitude  in  imitating  Him, 
according  to  the  words  of  Deuteronomy  iv.  24:  “Thy  God  is  a 
consuming  fire ;”  and  Heb.  L 7,  “ Who  maketh  His  angels  spirits  and 
His  ministers  a flame  of  fire.”  With  this  fire  burned  Elijah,  of 
whom  it  is  written,  “and  Elias  the  prophet  stood  up  as  a fire, 
and  his  word  burnt  like  a torch,”  Eccles.  xlviiL  1,  and  therefore 
he  was  carried  up  into  heaven  in  a chariot  of  fire ; and  Elisha  cried 
out,  “ My  father,  my  father,  the  chariot  of  Israel  and  the  horsemen 

thereof.”  Consumed  by  this  fire  the  martyrs  despised  their  lives,

nay,  rather  courted  the  flames,  either  because  they  did  not  feel  them, 
like  the  three  children  in  the  furnace  at  Babylon,  or  that  they  over* 
came  them  by  their  heroic  virtue,  as  did  S.  Laurence,  of  whom  it 
is  sung,  Ps.  xvii.  3,  “Thou  hast  visited  me  in  the  night  (Vulg.)  with 
fire.”  Hard  indeed  and  bitter  was  this  test  of  fire,  but  the  love  of 
God  conquered  the  pain ; the  torments  of  the  Lamb  overcame  the 
torment  of  the  fire ; the  memory  of  Christ,  I mean,  who  suffered  foi 
us  still  more  bitterly.  “ The  fire  of  love  could  not  be  mastered  by 
thy  flames,  O tyrant,”  said  S.  Leo  in  his  sermon  on  S.  Laurence. 
“ The  fire  that  burnt  outwardly  was  more  sluggish  than  that  which 
burnt  within.  Thou  ragedst,  as  a persecutor  against  the  Martyr  thou 
ragedst,  and  increased  his  palm  whilst  thou  augmented  his  punish- 
ment;” and  S.  Augustine  on  Laurence:  “The  blessed  Laurence 
was  consumed  by  this  fire,  but  he  felt  not  the  heat  of  the  flames,  and 
whilst  he  burnt  with  the  love  of  Christ,  he  regarded  not  the  punish- 
ment of  the  persecutor.”  So  S.  Ignatius,  writing  to  the  Romans, 
“Let  fire,”  he  says,  “the  breaking  of  my  limbs  by  wild  beasts,  the 
dismembering  of  my  body,  the  breaking  to  pieces  of  my  whole 
frame,  and  all  the  torments  of  the  devil  come  upon  me,  so  only  that 
I may  have  enjoyment  of  Christ”  Of  the  same  kind  were  also  the 
Christians  in  the  time  of  Tertullian,  who  (in  50  chap.  ApoL)  writes 
thus  to  the  Gentiles : “ Although  you  now  call  us  Sarmentitii  because 
we  are  burnt  at  the  stake  by  a heap  of  faggots  (sarmentorum),  and 
Senarii  because  we  are  broken  on  the  wheel,  yet  this  is  the  garment  of 
our  victory,  this  our  robe  of  glory,  in  this  chariot  we  triumph.”  Are 
not  these  terrestrial  seraphim  more  brave  and  ardent  than  the 
celestial?  The  latter  abound  with  the  fire  of  love  only,  the  former 
with  that  of  pain  and  martyrdom  also,  for  they  are  living  holocausts 
of  God.  In  our  own  age,  in  the  same  fire,  were  and  are  consumed 
tiie  Japanese,  who  were  burnt  to  death  in  a slow  fire  for  many  hours, 
and  remained  in  them  unsubdued  and  unconquered  like  adamant,  to 
death.  Many  of  them  were  of  our  society,  standard-bearers  as  it 
were  of  (the)  faith ; among  them  was  R.  P.  Camillus  Constantins  of 
Italy,  who  remained  for  three  hours  in  the  fire  immovable,  nay,  even 
joyful  and  exulting ; (continually)  crying  out  to  God  with  a loud  voice,

or  animating  his  companions  to  constancy,  or  stirring  up  the  people, 
a thing  we  have  not  hitherto  read  of  in  the  lives  of  the  Martyrs, 
until  the  flames  seized  on  his  inner  organs,  and  deprived  him  at  once 
of  voice  and  life,  that  so  he  might  die  a glorious  victim  of  a holo- 
caust to  God. 

Hail,  heroes  of  illustrious  souls,  champions  of  the  faith,  a spectacle 
to  God,  to  angels,  and  to  men.  Burning  with  divine  Are  you  resigned, 
for  the  faith  of  Christ,  your  bodies  to  the  flames,  and  your  souls  to 
God;  and  from  amidst  those  flames,  rejoicing  with  the  voice  of 
swans,  you  covered  yourselves  with  merits,  amazed  the  tyrants, 
filled  and  adorned  Japan  with  Christians,  your  society  with  heroic 
virtues,  the  world  with  fame,  the  Church  with  glory,  the  heavens 
with  the  laurels  of  fresh  champions.  For  ever  live  your  glory,  your 
unconquered  fortitude,  your  fire  and  ardour  of  heart,  by  which  you 
will  have  illuminated  and  inflamed  Japan,  as  long  as  the  course  of 
ages  shall  endure. 

Thus  thinking,  S.  Eulalia,  burning  with  the  desire  of  martyrdom, 
proceeded,  without  the  knowledge  of  her  parents,  to  her  conflict, 
and,  as  Prudentius  tells  us  in  his  hymn  3,  when  she  was  being  con* 
sumed  by  the  flames,  she  sang  a hymn  “ On  the  Crowns : ” — 


Ergo  tortor,  adure. 

Divide  membra  coacta  Into 
Solvere  rem  fragilem,  facile  est, 
Non  penetrabitur,  interior, 
Exagitante  dolore,  animus. 


Come,  thou  tormentor,  come  and  bum, 
And  cut,  and  wound,  and  slay, 
Dissever  thou  these  limbs  of  mine, 
Joined  but  by  feeble  clay. 

How  easy  ’tis,  so  frail  a thing, 

Entirely  to  destroy ; 

Tormenting  pain  can  never  touch 
My  inner  spirit’s  joy. 


And  thus,  in  the  thirteenth  year  of  her  age,  surrounded  by  flames, 


Virgo,  citum  cupiens  obitum,  For  speedy  death  the  Virgin  wish'd, 
Appedt  et  bibit  ore  rogum.  And  with  a joyful  smile 

The  bitter  cup  of  death  she  drank, 
Upon  the  funeral  pile. 

The  martyr,  in  the  form  of  a dove,  flew  up  to  heaven.

And  what  will  I if  it  be  already  kindled  t The  Arabic  has,  “What 
will  I but  its  kindling?”  S.  Jerome  to  Nepotian,  “ How  I long  for  it 
to  be  kindled ! ” Origen  (Horn,  v.  on  Ezekiel ),  “ I would  it  were 
kindled;”  Philaster  on  the  Heresies  (cap.  nil.),  “How  I wish  that 
it  were  kindled ; ” that  is,  as  the  Syriac  reads,  “ If  now  at  length  it 
were  kindled.”  SS.  Hilary  on  Ps.  cxx.,  Tbeophylact,  Euthymius, 
and  Cyril  in  the  Catena^  “ I wish  nothing  but  that  this  fire  were  at 
length  kindled ; if  it  were,  there  is  nothing  else  I desire,  this  is  my 
one  only  prayer.”  Both  readings  amount  to  the  same  thing — “I 
came  to  cast  fire  upon  the  earth,  and  what  will  I if  it  is  already 
kindled?” — that  everywhere  throughout  the  world  He  might  kindle 
the  earthly,  lukewarm,  frigid,  nay,  rocky,  ice-cold,  and  rigid  hearts 
of  men,  by  His  words  and  example,  with  the  fierce  heat  of  fervour, 
and  turn  them  into  the  fire  of  love.  So  did  our  own  S.  Ignatius, 
the  founder  of  the  Society  of  Jesus.  But  to  accomplish  this  there 
is  need  of  much  warmth  and  zeal  He,  therefore,  who  would  inspire 
others  with  this  fire,  must  first  kindle  it  strongly  in  himsell

And  how  am  I straitened  till  it  be  accomplished!  “This  fire  of 
love  and  zeal  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  cannot  break  forth  unless  the  flint 
of  My  body  be  first  struck  upon  the  cross,  or  rather,  until  I am 
baptized  in  the  font  of  My  own  blood.”  This  is  like  some  fountains 
into  which  if  we  plunged  a torch,  by  the  wonderful  power  of  nature^ 
and  an  antiperistasis,  it  is  lighted.  Such,  according  to  Pliny,  is 
the  fountain  of  Dodona  (bk.  iL  chap.  103).  Our  brethren  of 
Coimbra,  in  Meteora  (tract  ix.  chap.  7),  say  that  there  is  another  in 
Epirus,  and  a third  in  India,  the  waters  of  which  bum;  another, 
again,  which  formerly  took  its  name  from  Jupiter  Ammon.  This 
just  before  the  dawn  is  tepid,  at  midday  it  becomes  cold,  it  is  warm

THE  HOLY  ZEAL  OF  CHRIST.

in  the  evening,  and  it  boils  at  midnight.  Similar  springs  are  found 
near  Naples,  in  France,  and  other  places.  Our  Lord,  then,  compares 
His  passion  to  these.  This  is  like  a boiling  fountain  which  has 
aroused,  and  still  arouses,  the  fire  of  love  in  the  minds  of  the  faithful. 
For  equally  by  the  merit  of  the  cross  and  passion  of  Christ  and  by 
His  example  does  this  fire  burst  forth.  He  calls  His  death  and  pas- 
sion a baptism,  because  He  was  clearly  sunk  and  overwhelmed  in  it, 
as  says  the  Psalm,  “ I sink  in  deep  mire  where  there  is  no  standing, 
I am  come  into  deep  waters,  where  the  floods  overflow  me,”  lxix.  a. 

And  how  am  1 straitened  until  it  be  accomplished  t That  is,  “ I 
am  afflicted  and  tormented  by  the  longing  to  die  for  the  salvation 
of  men  and  by  My  death  to  kindle  this  flame.”  Euthymius : “I  am 
anxious  because  of  its  slowness ; ” and  Theophylact : “ How  am  I 
straitened,9'  that  is,  how  anxious  and  oppressed  am  I until  it  be 
performed,  “ for  I thirst  for  death  for  the  good  of  all  men.”  So 
S.  Ambrose,  Bede,  and  others.  The  Arabic  has,  “ I am  narrowed 
for  its  performance.”  S.  Irenseus  1. 18  reads,  “I  earnestly  hasten  to 
it”  For  the  hearts  of  the  anxious  are  wont  to  be  contracted  and  as  it 
were  compressed  by  such,  whilst  those  of  the  joyful  are  expanded  and 
dilated  De  Lyra,  therefore,  renders  it  amiss,  MI  am  narrowed,” 
he  says,  “ that  is,  I am  filled  with  dread,  according  to  the  words, 
• My  soul  is  sorrowful  even  unto  death.9  ” This,  indeed,  was  a feel- 
ing natural  to  the  soul  of  Christ,  but  He  quelled  and  overcame  it 
when  He  said,  “ Not  as  I will,  but  as  Thou  wilt" 

Morally . Observe  how  great  was  the  zeal  of  Christ,  how  great 
His  love,  how  deep  His  thirst  for  our  salvation.  For  it  was  this  that 
raised  in  Him  so  great  a thirst  for  His  Passion,  death,  and  cruci- 
fixion, cruel  as  they  were ; so  that  His  heart,  between  their  infliction 
and  the  waiting  for  them,  was  compressed,  as  between  the  two  stones 
of  a mill,  and  brought  into  the  greatest  straits ; or  placed,  as  it  were, 
in  a vice  and  compressed  with  anguish,  lest  what  He  loved  should 
be  refused  or  delayed.  Christ  then  was  urged  and,  as  it  were,  burnt 
up  by  the  utmost  longing  to  offer  Himself  up  to  God  as  a holocaust 
on  the  altar  of  the  cross,  that,  as  far  as  in  Him  lay,  He  might  sanctify, 
save,  and  bless  all  men.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XII. 


This  zeal,  His  thirst,  He  impressed  upon  the  Apostles  and 
apostolic  men,  who  thirsted  for  crosses,  labours,  pains,  torments, 
and  martyrdoms,  for  the  glory  of  God : that  they  might  propagate 
the  gospel  of  Christ  throughout  the  whole  world  and  save  as 
many  as  they  could.  This  is  the  holiness  of  the  Gospel,  this  is 
the  perfection  of  virtue,  this  is  the  crown  of  the  Apostleship. 
S.  Andrew's  salutations  of  the  cross,  and  his  earnest  longing  for  it,  are 
known.  “ Hail,  precious  cross,  long  desired,  and  at  last  ready  for  my 
longing  soul ! Secure  and  rejoicing  I come  to  thee ; do  thou  with  joy 
accept  me,  and  through  Thyself  do  Thou  receive  me  who  by  dying 
for  me  hast  redeemed  me.*'  S.  Laurence  said  to  the  Emperor 
Valerian,  when  he  showed  to  him  with  threats,  flames,  wheels,  scor- 
pions, wild  beasts : “ For  this  table  I hunger,  I thirst  There  is  no 
famished  man  who  desires  food,  there  is  no  one  perishing  of  thirst 
who  craves  for  water,  as  greedily  as  I court  and  covet  all  these 
torments,  that  I may  repay  to  Christ  my  Saviour,  pain  for  pain, 
death  for  death.”  S.  Vicentius  to  Dacian : “ No  one  living  has  con- 
ferred on  me  greater  gifts  than  thou,  who  torturest  and  cruciflest  me, 
for  with  as  many  tortures  as  thou  afflictest  me  with — with  so  many 
crowns  of  martyrdom  dost  thou  adorn  me.”  And  to  the  execu- 
tioners, “ How  slow  are  ye,  how  slothful ! n 

S.  Agatha  to  Quintianus,  “Why  are  you  so  slow?  What  do  you 
wait  for? — scourge,  lacerate,  burn,  cut  down,  mangle,  slay  my  body, 
for  the  more  you  crucify  me,  the  more  good  you  confer  upon  me, 
and  the  more  favour  and  grace  shall  I receive  from  my  spouse  Jesus 
Christ”  Such  were  the  vows  and  such  the  words  of  SS.  Agnes, 
Lucia,  Dorothea,  Ccecilia,  and  other  Martyrs. 

Ver.  51. — Think  ye  that  I am  come  to  give  peace  in  the  earth  t I 
tell  you  nay9  hut  rather  division.  See  what  I have  said  Matt  x.  34. 

Ver.  52. — For  there  shall  be from  henceforth  five  in  one  house  divided^ 
three  against  two , and  two  against  three.  Five,  that  is — Father,  son, 
mother,  daughter,  daughter-in-law,  for  mother-in-law  is  the  same  as 
mother.  So  S.  Ambrose.  And  this  is  plain  from  what  follows.  In 
the  same  house  three  unbelievers  shall  rise  against  two  believers,  or 
two  unbelieving  against  three  faithful,  or  father  and  son,  who  do  not

believe  in  Christ,  shall  rise  against  mother,  daughter,  and  daughter 
m-law  who  do  believe  in  Him,  or  the  contrary. 

Ver.  54. — And  He  said  to  the  multitudes  also , When  ye  see  a doud 
rising  in  the  west \ straightway  ye  say , There  cometh  a shower ; and 
so  it  cometh  to  pass.  When  you  see  a cloud  from  the  west  you  say, 
It  will  rain.  In  the  same  manner  Elijah,  in  the  time  of  the  three 
years*  drought,  when  he  heard  from  his  servant  that  a cloud  had 
arisen  in  the  west,  at  once  foretold  that  rain  would  follow,  and  it  did 
so.  1.  Kings  xviii.  44.  The  cause  of  this  is  natural ; for  Judaea  has 
the  Mediterranean  on  the  west,  from  which  by  the  force  of  the  sun 
many  vapours  are  exhaled,  which,  when  condensed  into  clouds 
by  the  heat  of  the  sun,  produce  rain,  especially  when  the  sun  is  also 
in  the  west;  for  it  is  then  too  weak  to  disperse  these  vapours 
and  prevent  them  from  condensing  into  clouds  and  dissolving  in 
rain.  But  the  countries  that  have  the  sea  equally  on  the  west, 
the  south  and  the  north  have,  equally,  from  these  quarters,  clouds 
as  forerunners  of  winds,  as  the  English,  who  have  the  sea  on  all  sides 
of  them.  See  Matt  xvi.  3.  It  is  necessary  to  human  life,  says  S. 
Basil  in  the  Catena,  to  watch  the  heavenly  bodies,  so  that  their  warn- 
ings be  not  examined  into  beyond  measure.  It  is  of  consequence 
to  look  out  for,  and  guard  against  storms,  and  for  the  traveller  to 
regard  the  changes  of  temperature,  for  the  husbandman  to  consider 
the  position  of  the  sun  and  moon  for  his  sowing  that  he  may  have 
an  abundant  harvest ; for  God  has  appointed  these  things  for  signs 
and  for  seasons.

CHAPTER  XIII. 

I.  Christ  preacheth  repentance  upon  the  punishment  of  the  Galileans , and  others. 
6 The  fruitless  fig  tree  may  not  stand,  n He  healeth  the  crooked  woman : 
18  showeth  the  poiverful  working  of  the  word  in  the  hearts  of  his  chosen,  by  the 
parable  of  the  grain  of  mustard  seed,  and  of  leaven  : 24  exhorteth  to  enter  in  at 
the  strait  gate,  31  and  reproveth  Herod  and  Jerusalem . 

THERE  were  present  at  that  season  some  that  told  him  of  the  Galilseans,  whose 
blood  Pilate  had  mingled  with  their  sacrifices. 

2  And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  them,  Suppose  ye  that  these  Galilseans  were 
sinners  above  all  the  Galilseans,  because  they  suffered  such  things? 

3  I tell  you.  Nay : but,  except  ye  repent,  ye  shall  all  likewise  perish. 

4  Or  those  eighteen,  upon  whom  the  tower  in  Siloam  fell,  and  slew  them,  think 
ye  that  they  were  sinners  above  all  men  that  dwelt  in  Jerusalem? 

5  I tell  you.  Nay  : but,  except  ye  repent,  ye  shall  all  likewise  perish. 

6  U He  spake  also  this  parable : A certain  man  had  a fig-tree  planted  in  his 
vineyard : and  he  came  and  sought  fruit  thereon,  and  found  none. 

7  Then  said  he  unto  the  dresser  of  his  vineyard.  Behold,  these  three  years  I 
come  seeking  fruit  on  this  fig-tree,  and  find  none  : cut  it  down ; why  cumbereth 
it  the  ground  ? 

8  And  he  answering  said  unto  him,  Lord,  let  it  alone  this  year  also,  till  I shall 
dig  about  it,  and  dung  it: 

9  And  if  it  bear  fruit,  well:  and  if  not,  then  after  that  thou  shalt  cut  it  down. 

10  T And  he  was  teaching  in  one  of  the  synagogues  on  the  sabbath. 

1 1  And,  behold,  there  was  a woman  which  had  a spirit  of  infirmity  eighteen 
years,  and  was  bowed  together,  and  could  in  no  wise  lift  up  herself 

12  And  when  Jesus  saw  her,  he  called  her  to  him , and  said  unto  her,  Woman, 
thou  art  loosed  from  thine  infirmity. 

13  And  he  laid  his  hands  on  her : and  immediately  she  was  made  straight, 
and  glorified  God. 

14  And  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  answered  with  indignation,  because  that 
Jesus  had  healed  on  the  sabbath  day,  and  said  unto  the  people,  There  are  six  days 
in  which  men  ought  to  work : in  them  therefore  come  and  be  healed,  and  not  on 
the  sabbath  day. 

15  The  Lord  then  answered  him,  and  said,  Thou  hypocrite,  doth  not  each  one 
of  you  on  the  sabbath  lose  his  ox  or  his  ass  from  the  stall,  and  lead  him  away  to 
watering? 

16  And  ought  not  this  woman,  being  a daughter  of  Abraham,  whom  Satan 
hath  bound,  lo,  these  eighteen  years,  be  loosed  from  this  bond  on  the  sabbath 
day?

17  And  when  he  had  said  these  things,  all  his  adversaries  were  ashamed  : and 
all  the  people  rejoiced  for  all  the  glorious  things  that  were  done  by  him. 

18  T Then  said  he,  Unto  what  is  the  kingdom  of  God  like?  and  whereunto 
shall  I resemble  it  ? 

19  It  is  like  a grain  of  mustard-seed,  which  a man  took,  and  cast  Into  his 
garden ; and  it  grew,  and  waxed  a great  tree ; and  the  fowls  of  the  air  lodged  in 
the  branches  of  it 

20  1 And  again  he  said,  Whereunto  shall  I liken  the  kingdom  of  God  ? 

21  It  is  like  leaven,  which  a woman  took  and  hid  in  three  measures  of  meal, 
till  the  whole  was  leavened. 

22  And  he  went  through  the  cities  and  villages,  teaching,  and  journeying 
toward  Jerusalem. 

23  T Then  said  one  unto  him.  Lord,  are  there  few  that  be  saved  ? And  he 
said  unto  them, 

24  Strive  to  enter  in  at  the  strait  gate : for  many,  I say  unto  you,  will  seek  to 
enter  in,  and  shall  not  be  able. 

25  When  once  the  Master  of  the  house  is  risen  up,  and  hath  shut  to  the  door, 
and  ye  begin  to  stand  without,  and  to  knock  at  the  door,  saying,  Lord,  Lord,  open 
unto  us ; and  he  shall  answer  and  say  unto  you,  I know  you  not  whence  ye  are : 

2 6 Then  shall  ye  begin  to  say,  We  have  eaten  and  drunk  in  thy  presence,  and 
thou  hast  taught  in  our  streets. 

27  But  he  shall  say,  I tell  you,  I know  ye  not  whence  ye  are ; depart  from 
me,  all  ye  workers  of  iniquity. 

28  There  shall  be  weeping  and  gnashing  of  teeth,  when  ye  shall  see  Abraham, 
and  Isaac,  and  Jacob,  and  all  the  prophets,  in  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  you  your- 
selves  thrust  out. 

29  And  they  shall  come  from  the  east,  and  from  the  west,  and  from  the  north, 
and  from  the  south,  and  shall  sit  down  in  the  kingdom  of  God. 

30  And,  behold,  there  are  last  which  shall  be  first,  and  there  are  first  which 
shall  be  last. 

31  If  The  same  day  there  came  certain  of  the  Pharisees,  saying  unto  him,  Get 
thee  out,  and  depart  hence : for  Herod  will  kill  thee. 

32  And  he  said  unto  them,  Go  ye,  and  tell  that  fox.  Behold,  I cast  out  devils, 
and  I do  cures  to-day  and  to-morrow,  and  the  third  day  I shall  be  perfected. 

33  Nevertheless  I must  walk  to-day,  and  to-morrow,  and  the  day  following : 
for  it  cannot  be  that  a prophet  perish  out  of  Jerusalem. 

34  O Jerusalem,  Jerusalem,  which  killest  the  prophets,  and  stonest  them  that 
are  sent  unto  thee ; how  often  would  I have  gathered  thy  children  together,  as  a 
hen  doth  gather  her  brood  under  her  wings,  and  ye  would  not ! 

35  Behold,  your  house  is  left  unto  you  desolate : and  verily  I say  unto  you,  Ye 
shall  not  see  me,  until  the  time  come  when  ye  shall  say,  Blessed  is  he  that  cometh 
in  the  name  of  the  Lord. 

Ver.  1. — Whose  blood  Pilate  mingled.  That  is,  whom  while  they 
were  sacrificing  in  Mount  Gerizim  in  Samaria,  Pilate  slew.  He 
slew  them  that  their  blood  might  be  mingled  with  the  blood  of  their 
victims.  Josephus  relates  the  whole  at  length  ( Antiq book  xviii.

S.  LUKE.  C.  X1IL 


chap.  7),  as  also  does  Hegesippus  on  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem 
Josephus  says,  “ A certain  impostor  incited  the  people  to  assemble 
on  Mount  Gerizim,  a mountain  which  they  held  very  sacred,  by 
the  promise  of  shewing  them  certain  vessels  which  Moses  had 
deposited  there  and  he  had  dug  up.  They  credulously  took  arms 
and  occupied  the  village  Tirathaba,  awaiting  the  arrival  of  others 
that  they  might  ascend  the  mountain  in  force.  But  Pilate  seized 
it  before  them,  and  held  it  with  cavalry  and  foot  soldiers.  These 
attacked  the  Samaritans  in  the  village,  killing  some  and  putting 
the  rest  to  flight  He  also  took  many  prisoners,  the  chief  and 
most  powerful  of  whom  he  put  to  death.” 

It  may  be  said,  u Josephus  asserts  them  to  have  been  Samaritans  ; 
how  then  does  Christ  call  them  Galileans?”  The  answer  is,  " They 
were  called  Samaritans  from  their  country  and  nation,  but  Galileans 
from  their  sect  and  heresy.”  So  says  Baronius.  To  explain  the 
matter,  observe  that  Judas  of  Galilee,  as  St  Luke  says,  Acts  v.  37, 
was  the  author  of  the  sect  of  Galileans  who  rebelled  against 
Caesar,  saying  that  it  was  not  lawful  for  the  Jews,  who  were  a 
faithful  people,  and  worshipped  the  true  God,  to  be  subject  to 
Caesar,  a Gentile,  and  an  idolater,  and  to  give  him  tribute ; for  they 
ought  to  acknowledge  and  obey  no  other  lord  but  God.  So  S. 
Cyril  in  the  Catena^  Theophylact,  Euthymius,  and  Titus.  Hence 
Pilate  sent  a force  and  destroyed  them.  This  sect  arose  about 
the  time  of  Christ.  Hence  Christ  and  the  Apostles,  being  Galileans 
by  nation,  were  accused  of  the  same,  and  they  therefore  carefully 
taught  in  opposition  that  tribute  ought  to  be  given  to  kings  and  to 
Caesar,  even  if  Gentiles.  Francis  Lucas  thinks  that  these  Galileans 
were  slain  by  Pilate  in  Jerusalem,  when  they  were  sacrificing  in 
the  Temple,  because  Pilate  was  Procurator  of  Judaea  and  not  of 
Samaria.  But  Josephus  plainly  says  that  they  were  killed  in  Mount 
Gerizim,  which  is  in  Samaria.  The  Samaritans,  moreover,  were  a 
schism  from  the  Jews,  and  would  not  go  into  the  Temple  at  Jeru- 
salem, but  built  another  in  their  own  power  on  Mount  Gerizim,  as  we 
find  from  S.  John  iv.  20.  Pilate  therefore  attacked  these  Samaritans  as 
rebels,  and  put  them  to  death  in  Samaria,  as  open  enemies  to  Caesar.

GODS  JUDGMENTS  LEAD  TO  REPENTANCE.  33 1 

When  the  slaughter  of  the  Samaritans  was  frequently  repeated, 
there  were  different  opinions  on  the  subject,  many  affirming  that 
they  were  wicked  men  and  hated  by  God;  their  sacrifices  not 
only  being  rejected  but  also  mixed  with  their  blood.  They  related 
this  to  Christ  and  asked  His  opinion  of  the  matter,  but  Christ 
made  a wise  use  of  this  occasion,  and  drew  from  it  an  argument  to 
rouse  them  to  repentance,  lest  a similar  vengeance  should  fall  upon 
ffiem.  The  preacher  should  follow  this  example,  and  when  public 
slaughter,  pest,  famine,  or  wars  befall,  exhort  his  people  to  repent- 
ance, that  they  may  escape  such  inflictions  and,  with  them,  the 
torments  of  Gehenna. 

Ver.  2. — And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  them,  Suppose  ye,  &*c. 
They  did  suppose  this,  but  wrongly,  for  God  often  corrects  those 
who  sin  less  heavily,  to  make  them  an  example  and  a terror  to 
others,  and  so  incite  them  to  penitence.  So  Bede,  Titus,  and  others. 

Ver.  3. — I tell  you,  Nay:  but,  except  ye  repent,  ye  shall  all  likewise 
perish.  " Likewise  ” — that  is,  by  a similar  death,  none  excepted,  says 
Maldonatus ; and  so  Wisdom  vi  8 : “He  hath  made  the  small  and 
great,  and  careth  for  all  alike.  For  He  cares  for  all  without 
exception,  though  for  some  more  and  for  others  less.”  Secondly, 
and  more  simply,  You  shall  equally  perish,  though  by  another  kind 
of  death,  by  an  eternal  instead  of  a temporal  one,  or  even  by  a tem- 
poral. Thirdly,  and  properly,  Jansenius  says,  “ By  a similar  death  ; 
the  destruction  and  vengeance  of  God.”  For  the  Jews  were  besieged 
by  Titus  at  the  time  of  the  Passover,  when  they  were  sacrificing ; 
and,  when  the  city  was  taken,  many  were  slain  in  the  temple,  where 
they  were  sacrificing,  and  accustomed  to  sacrifice.  So  Euthymius, 
S.  Thomas,  Hugo,  N.  de  Lyra,  S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena. 

Observe  that  Christ  here  teaches  us,  in  like  calamities,  to  give  our 
minds  to  the  thought  of  our  sins,  and  to  repentance,  that  vc  fall  not 
into  the  like  punishments  of  God. 

Symbolically,  Bede  says  that  Pilate  means,  the  mouth  of  the 
hammerer,  (os  malleatoris)  that  is,  the  Devil,  who  is  always  ready  to 
destroy.  “ Blood  ” — that  is,  sin  and  concupiscence.  The  sacrifices 
are  good  actions  which  the  Devil,  either  for  the  delight  of  the  flesh,

or  from  the  ambition  of  human  praise,  or  some  other  evil  motive, 
pollutes. 

Ver.  4. — Or  of  those  eighteen  upon  whom  the  tower  of  Siloam  fell. 
There  was  a fountain,  or  rather  pool,  near  Jerusalem  of  which 
Isaiah  speaks,  “ This  people  refuses  the  waters  of  Shiloah  that  go 
softly,”  viii.  6.  Near  this  fountain  was  a tower  also  called  Siloe, 
from  it,  which  in  the  time  of  Christ  fell  down,  either  from  the  force 
of  the  wind,  or  from  lightning,  or  an  earthquake,  or  some  other  like 
cause,  and  destroyed  eighteen  persons  who  were  either  in  it,  or 
standing  near.  This,  if  we  only  regard  secondary  causes,  may  have 
happened  by  chance ; but  if  we  consider  the  one  primary  one,  that 
is,  God,  it  was  done  by  His  appointed  Providence,  who  deter- 
mines to  punish  some  and  to  terrify  others.  For  with  God  nothing 
is  fortuitous,  but  everything  is  certainly  foreseen  and  prepared,  that 
nothing  in  His  Kingdom  should,  as  Boethius  says,  be  ascribed  to 
chance  or  temerity.  God,  then,  orders  these  events  for  the  chastise- 
ment and  correction  of  man,  that  others,  seeing  their  neighbours 
killed  by  the  fall  of  a tower  or  some  other  sudden  accident,  may 
fear  lest  something  similar  happen  to  themselves,  and  so  may  repent 
and  reconcile  themselves  to  God,  lest  they  be  overwhelmed  by  His 
judgments  and  condemned  to  Gehenna.  This  is  what  God  said  by 
the  prophet  Amos,  “Shall  there  be  evil  in  the  city,  and  the  Lord 
hath  not  done  it?”  iii.  6;  and  by  Isaiah,  “I  form  the  light  and 
create  darkness,  I make  peace  and  create  evil  ” xlv.  7.  The  poets 
and  philosophers  saw  the  same  through  a shade : 

— O qui  res  hominumque  Deumque,  “ O Thou  who  dost  the  affairs 

iEternis  regis  imperils,  et  fulmine  Of  men  and  gods,  by  laws  eternal  rale, 

terres.  And  by  thy  lightning  fierce  dost 

terrify.” 

And  Plutarch  (In  Moral. \ “As  if  a blind  man  should  fall  against  a 
person,  and  call  that  person  blind  for  not  avoiding  him,  so  we  make 
Fortune  blind,  whereas  we  stumble  against  her  from  our  own  want 
of  sight  For  this  very  • Fortuna  fortunans,’  which  is,  in  truth,  no 
other  than  God  Himself  and  the  Providence  of  God  is  most  keen  of 
sight,  and  has  many  more  eyes  than  Argus.”

PARABLE  OF  THE  FIG-TREE.

Symbolically . “The  tower,”  says  Bede,  “is  Christ,  Siloe,  that  is, 
He  who  is  sent  by  the  Father  into  the  world,  and  who  crushes  to 
powder  all  the  wicked  upon  whom  He  falls,  through  the  sentence  of 
His  condemnation.” 

Think  ye  that  they  were  sinners  above  all  men  that  dwelt  in  Jeru- 
salem t " Sinners  ” — the  Arabic  has  culpabiles ; the  Chaldaic,  chare- 
bim,  i.e.  debtors  (for  a debtor  owes  his  soul,  that  is  10,000  talents,  S. 
Matt  xviii  24,  to  God).  Christ  shows  clearly  that  these  eighteen 
who  were  killed  by  the  fall  of  the  tower  of  Siloam,  were  sinners, 
though  not,  perhaps,  the  worst  and  greatest  that  were  in  Jerusalem. 

Ver.  5. — I tell  you.  Nay;  but ; except  ye  repent, ; ye  shall  all  likewise 
perish.  “This  shows,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “that  these  eighteen 
were  appointed  as  an  example  and  terror  to  the  others ; though 
each  was  punished  for  his  own  sins.  This  was  made  wholesome 
matter  for  others,  that  the  fool  might  be  made  wiser  by  the  event 
For  God  does  not  punish  all  here,  but  He  leaves  a time  for  repent- 
ance. Again,  he  does  not  leave  all  for  a future  punishment,  lest 
many  should  deny  His  Providence.” 

Verses  6,  7. — He  spake  also  this  parable.  “Cumbereth” — the 
Greek  is  nardfy  1#,  that  is,  loads  with  a useless  burthen,  nay, 
renders  the  ground  barren  and  fruitless,  as  well  by  its  shade  as 
by  its  roots,  which  keep  the  earth's  moisture  from  the  other  trees. 
The  Syriac  says,  “ keeps  it  idle ; ” for  £#**,  is  idle,  inert,  devoid  of 
strength. 

In  the  letter  the  fig-tree  represents  the  synagogue  of  the  Jews, 
which  God  planted  through  Moses ; to  which  Christ  came  by  the 
Incarnation,  to  cultivate  it  by  His  preaching.  Christ,  therefore,  is 
the  keeper  of  the  vine,  that  is,  of  the  synagogue,  to  whom  God  said, 
“ Cut  it  down,  for  now  for  three  years  in  which  Thou  hast  preached 
to  it,  I have  looked  for  the  fruit  of  faith  and  good  works,  and  I find 
none,  from  the  unbelief,  perverseness,  and  malice  of  the  Jews.” 
Christ  intercedes  for  it,  that  the  Father  would  allow  Him  to  tend 
it  by  His  preaching  for  one  year  more,  or,  at  least,  for  half  an  one ; 
and  then,  if  it  gave  no  fruit,  it  might  be  cut  down.  So  it  came  to 
pass  : for  the  Jews,  in  the  fourth  year  of  Christ's  preaching,  at  the

Passover,  adding  sin  to  sin,  and  becoming  more  and  more  perverse, 
crucified  Him ; so  that,  a few  years  after,  Titus  was  sent  by  God  as 
His  avenger,  and  took  Jerusalem,  and  destroyed  all  Judsea.  What 
remains  are  additions  belonging  to  the  finish  of  the  parable,  which 
it  is  unnecessary  to  apply  to  what  is  signified  by  it 

S.  Ambrose  observes,  that  the  fig-tree  is  an  apt  symbol  of  the 
Synagogue : first,  because  it  was  a tree  with  abundance  of  leaves,  but 
which  disappointed  its  owner  in  his  hope  of  fruit  Secondly,  while 
the  doctors  of  the  Synagogue  were  fruitless  of  good  works  and 
boasted  only  of  words  like  redundant  leaves,  the  vain  shadow  of  the 
law  flourished  exuberantly,  but  the  false  hope  of  the  expected  pro- 
duce deceived  the  prayers  of  the  people. 

Secondly,  as  the  fig  puts  out  a green,  that  is  an  immature,  fig 
(grossum)  instead  of  blossoms,  which  soon  falls,  and  then  produces 
a savoury  and  solid  fruit,  so  the  Synagogue  firstly  put  forth  the 
Jews,  like  green  and  evanescent  fruit,  and  then,  through  Christ, 
gave  Christians,  like  mature  and  savoury  figs.  So  Pliny,  vii  7, 
“Figs  are  produced  late,  if  the  green  fruit,  when  exceeding  the 
size  of  a bean,  are  taken  away,  for  then  are  produced  figs  that  ripen 
later.” 

Tropologieally.  The  fig  is  any  individual  person,  especially  a 
believer ; the  gardener  is  Christ,  the  Apostles,  and  the  like ; the  Lord 
is  God  the  Father,  or  the  Holy  Trinity.  Our  own  Salmeron  (tom. 
vii.,  tract  21),  gives  various  reasons  and  analogies,  why  the  faithful 
are  compared  to  a fig.  1.  The  fig  produces  sweet  fruit,  which 
seems  to  be  purses  of  honey  and  sugar,  and  the  righteous  produce 
the  like.  2.  As  the  fig  tree  increases  little  in  height  but  is  always 
short,  so  the  righteous  cast  themselves  down,  and  humble  them- 
selves. 3.  The  fig,  instead  of  blossoms,  gives  fruit,  and  that  twice; 
namely,  the  early  ripe  in  the  summer,  and  in  the  autumn  the  later— 
for  the  fig  bears  twice  a year,  as  the  righteous  is  ever  plentifully 
bringing  forth  the  fruit  of  good  works.  4.  As  the  fig  makes  a shade 
with  its  ample  leaves,  so  the  righteous  defends  and  protects  others 
by  his  charity.  5.  The  fig  is  never  grafted  into  another  tree,  because 
of  its  exceeding  sweetness,  which  cannot  leave  it  So  the  righteous

rests  in  no  man,  but  in  God  alone  and  his  own  conscience.  6.  The 
fig  tree,  if  stripped  of  its  bark,  gives  no  fruit,  but  withers  away ; and 
the  righteous,  unless  protected  by  the  bark  of  honest  conversation, 
modesty,  and  outward  decency,  will  bring  no  fruit  with  his  neigh- 
bours. 7.  The  fig  has  medical  properties,  and  heals  diseases,  as 
Isaiah  healed  Hezekiah  by  means  of  a fig  (Isa.  xxxviii.  21).  Pliny 
also  says  that  the  fig  alone,  of  trees,  has  medical  virtues.  So  the 
righteous,  because  he  is  perfect  and  mature  in  virtue,  ministers  to 
the  infirmities  of  others,  by  teaching,  advising,  and  living  holily. 
He  adds  that  lopping  and  pruning  it  remedies  its  too  great  luxu- 
riousness ; as  the  righteous  by  circumcising  and  cutting  off  the  desire 
of  honour  above,  and  the  appetites  of  the  senses  below,  by  medita- 
tions on  death  and  burial,  is  rendered  fruitful  in  virtue  and  good 
works,  and  converts  many  of  his  neighbours  to  God. 

Behold  these  three  years  I come  seeking  fruit.  This  alludes  to  the 
nature  of  the  fig  tree,  which  sometimes  gives  fruit  in  its  third  year. 
If  not  then,  it  commonly  does  not  give  it  at  all 

Symbolically , these  three  years,  according  to  Euthymius,  signify 
the  three  policies  or  political  status  of  the  Jews,  under  the  Judges, 
Kings,  and  the  High  Priests,  namely  the  Maccabees.  St  Ambrose 
says  “ He  came  to  Abraham,  He  came  to  Moses,  He  came  to  Mary; 
that  is,  He  came  in  circumcision,  He  came  in  the  Law,  He  came  in 
the  body.  We  acknowledge  His  Advent  from  His  benefits  to  us. 
In  the  first,  Purification ; in  the  second,  Sanctification ; in  the  third, 
Justification — Circumcision  purified,  the  Law  sanctified,  Grace  justi- 
fied— one  in  all,  and  all  in  one ; no  one  can  be  cleansed  but  one 
who  fears  God : no  one  deserves  to  receive  the  Law  but  one  who  is 
purified  from  sin : no  one  comes  to  Grace  but  he  who  knows  the 
Law.”  So  also  St  Cyril : “ God  sought  the  nature  of  the  human  race 
before  the  Law,  under  the  Law,  and  under  Grace  by  waiting, 
admonishing,  visiting;  but  some  are  not  corrected  by  the  natural 
law,  nor  taught  by  precept,  nor  converted  by  miracle.” 

Tropologically^  these  three  years,  says  Theophylact,  are  the  three 
ages  of  man— childhood ; full  manhood ; and  old  age.  For  every 
one  ought  at  all  times  to  bring  forth  the  fruits  of  virtue  to  God,  as

is  fitting  and  proportionate  to  every  age.  God,  who  would  have  no 
age  of  man  idle,  requires  these  of  every  one. 

And  He,  namely,  the  dresser  of  the  Vine,  Christ  and  the  Apostles, 
answering  said  unto  him,  Christ  and  the  Apostles,  says  the  Inter- 
lineator,  knowing  that  some  of  the  Jews  could  be  saved,  pray  God 
to  delay  the  avenging  of  the  Lord’s  cross,  that  is,  the  destruction  of 
Jerusalem  by  Titus. 

And  if  it  bear  fruit  Understand,  “ It  shall  be  well,  it  shall  be 
safe,  and  it  shall  be  saved.”  It  is  an  aposiopesis.  The  Arabic  adds, 
“For  it  has  brought  forth  fruit”  The  Synagogue  formerly  gave 
fruit  under  Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  Moses,  David,  and  others. 

And  if  not,  then  after  that  thou  shalt  cut  it  down . As  God  cut 
down  the  Jews  by  the  Romans. 

Mystically,  S.  Augustine  (JDe  Verb.  Dorn,)  says  : “ He  who  inter- 
cedes is  all  holy ; who,  within  the  Church,  prays  for  those  who  are 
without”  To  dig  about  the  conscience  is  to  teach  humility  and 
patience,  and  to  engraft  on  the  mind  the  consideration  of  heaven 
and  heavenly  things,  lest,  as  S.  Ambrose  says,  the  heap  overwhelm 
the  root  of  earthly  wisdom  and  of  earthly  desires  and  hide  it  from 
view. 

And  dung  it.  This  is,  as  S.  Ambrose  says,  the  feeling  of  humility , 
and  S.  Augustine  (He  Verb.  Horn,):  “Dung  is  filth,  but  it  causes  fruit- 
fulness. The  filth  of  the  vine-dresser  is  the  grief  of  the  sinner.” 
And  S.  Gregory,  “ Dung  is  the  sins  of  the  flesh,  from  which  the  mind 
is  roused  to  good  works.” 

Ver.  io. — And  He  was  teaching  in  one  of  the  synagogues  on  the 
Sabbath.  The  Sabbath  was  a festival  on  which  the  Jews  came  to  the 
synagogue  to  hear  the  Law  and  its  interpretation,  as  Christians  on 
the  Lord’s  day  come  together  to  hear  mass  and  the  sermon.  Christ 
chose  this  time  and  place  for  the  following  miracle,  that  it  might  be 
public^  and  that  He  might  confute  and  instruct  the  Pharisees,  when 
speaking  against  it  on  account  of  the  Sabbath. 

Ver.  n. — And  behold  there  was  a woman . “ The  spirit  of  infir- 

mity, that  is,  an  infirmity  sent  by  the  evil  one,”  says  de  Lyra, 
Euthymius,  “ The  devil  of  weakness  not  suffering  her  to  live.”  The

THE  CROOKED  WOMAN  HEALED. 


337 


Arabic  reads,  “With  whom  was  a spirit  of  infirmity  for  eighteen 
years,  and  she  was  bowed  together  and  was  not  able  to  stand  up 
by  any  means.”  This  infirmity  was  a curving  and  bending  of  the 
whole  body,  so  that  the  woman  was  compelled  always  to  walk 
bent  and  stooping.  Observe  that  diseases  are  often  sent  by  the 
devils,  through  the  permission  of  God,  for  sins  or  other  reasons. 
Ver.  16  shows  the  cause  of  this  infirmity,  " This  daughter  of  Abra- 
ham, whom  Satan  hath  bound.”  Thus  the  devil  afflicted  Job  with 
various  diseases,  chap.  ii.  The  same  is  seen  in  Ps.  lxxviii.  49,  and 
Matt  ix.  23.  The  devil,  therefore,  made  this  woman  crooked  and 
bent,  to  compel  her  always  to  look  down  upon  the  earth. 

Eighteen  years . It  was,  therefore,  an  inveterate  and  incurable 
disease,  and  as  such  could  not  be  healed  by  the  physicians. 

And  was  bowed  together.  Looking  towards  the  ground,  (cernua) 
crooked,  with  her  head  and  back  bent  downwards — nay,  she  was 
less  able  even  than  a beast  to  look  up  at  the  sun  and  heavens,  but 
must  always  look  down  at  the  rocks  and  the  earth.  For  at  the 
creation  (Gen.  L) 


Os  homini  sublime  dedit,  coelumque 
tueri 

Jussi t,  et  e rectos  ad  sidera  tollere 
vultus, — 


“ God  gave  to  man  a lofty  countenance, 
And  to  regard  the  heavens  commanded 
him. 

Bade  him  to  lift  his  form  erect,  and  gaze 
Upon  the  starry  host,” — 


that  he  might  look  up  at  the  sun  and  the  heavens,  and,  by  a heavenly 
life,  journey  towards  God  on  high,  and  be  received  into  heaven 
and  there  enjoy  the  blessedness  of  the  divine  vision ; for,  as  S.  Basil 
says  in  the  Catena , “We  should  seek  heavenly  things,  and  rise 
above  those  of  earth.”  The  devil,  then,  to  turn  men  from  heaven, 
makes  them  look  downwards,  so  that  they  see,  love,  and  pursue 
only  earthly  things. 

Ver.  12. — And  when  Jesus  saw  her  (the  Arabic  has  “Jesus  looked 
upon  her ; ” with  the  eyes,  that  is,  of  both  body  and  mind ; with  the 
eyes  of  grace,  pity,  and  mercy),  He  called  her  to  Him,  and  said  to 
hery  Woman , thou  art  loosed , &c.  “ Loosed,”  that  is,  thou  shalt  be 

dismissed  ; thou  art  healed ; healed  by  Me,  through  the  laying  on

of  My  hands,  as  followed.  For  Christ  seems  to  have  done  two 
things  at  the  same  time : to  have  laid  His  hands  upon  her,  and  so 
healed  her,  and  to  have  said,  Thou  art  loosed.  He  said,  “ Thou 
art  loosed,”  and  not  “ I loose  thee,”  to  sharpen  the  woman’s  faith. 
For  Christ  often  ascribes  healing  and  salvation  to  His  touch,  to 
show  the  virtue  of  His  word  and  contact,  for  in  the  same  moment 
in  which  He  touched  this  woman,  He  healed  her.  “ There  was  a 
divine  virtue,”  says  S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena,  “in  the  flesh  of  Christ, 
by  which  in  an  instant  He  worked  great  and  wonderful  miracles. 
As  when  He  said  ‘ This  is  My  Body,’  He  transmuted  the  bread  into 
His  Body,  as  He  transubstantiates  it  daily  in  the  Mass.  For,  to 
have  said,  This  is  My  body,  is  to  have  made  it  so ; as  in  the  words, 
* He  spake  and  it  was  done.’ " Hence,  Titus,  “ By  a word,  assuredly 
most  divine,  and  by  a most  perfect  heavenly  power,  He  removed 
the  infirmity  of  this  woman.”  Lastly,  the  words  “ Thou  art  loosed,” 
that  is,  thou  art  freed,  shows  that  the  woman  had  been  bound  by 
Satan,  constrained,  kept  down,  as  by  a chain,  so  that  her  head 
appeared  fixed  to  her  knees  and  thighs.  This  bond  Christ  loosed, 
and  thus  made  her  erect.  For  Christ  came  to  destroy  the  works  of 
the  deviL 

Ver.  13. — And  He  laid  His  hands  on  her  The  hands  signify  the 
power  of  Christ,  His  authority,  rule  over  diseases  and  devils ; and 
equally  His  loving-kindness  and  beneficence,  by  which  He  con- 
ferred the  benefit  of  healing  upon  the  woman,  through  the  bene- 
ficence of  His  touch. 

Ver.  14. — And  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  answered  noth  indigna- 
tion. With  indignation,  because  he  envied  Jesus  the  glory  of  a 
miracle  by  which  He  had  shown  Himself,  before  the  whole  syna- 
gogue and  people,  to  be  greater  than  the  ruler.  This  man  made 
religion  and  zeal  for  the  observation  of  the  Sabbath  the  cloak  of 
his  feeling.  He  is  therefore  called  a hypocrite  by  Christ  So 
S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena.  “When  the  ruler  of  this  ungrateful 
synagogue  saw  the  woman  made  suddenly  erect  by  a mere  touch, 
and  celebrating  the  great  acts  of  God,  he  sullied  his  zeal  for  the 
glory  of  the  Lord  with  envy,  and  censured  the  miracle  as  if  he  would

show  himself  solicitous  for  the  Sabbath.”  Observe  the  word  “ un- 
grateful.” He  ought  to  have  been  grateful  to  Christ  and  to  have 
given  Him  thanks  for  having  honoured  himself  and  the  synagogue, 
and  distinguished  it  by  this  miracle.  But  envy  had  so  blinded  him, 
that  he  thought  the  glory  of  Christ  his  own  dishonour  and  disgrace, 
for  he  was  unable  to  perform  such  and  so  great  acts,  himself  So 
Saul  ought  to  have  given  thanks  to  David  for  slaying  Goliath,  the 
dread  of  himself  and  of  all  Israel.  But  envy  made  him  so  perverse 
that  he  thought  the  glory  of  David  his  own  ignominy,  imagining  that 
David  was  preferred  to  himself,  and  that  he  himself  though  the 
king,  was  placed  below  him.  This  is  the  living  image  of  envy — the 
mask  of  religion — veiled  and  cloaked. 

Ver.  15. — The  Lord  thtn  answered  him , and  said , Thou  hypocrite. 
Hypocrites  who  feign  sanctity  abroad,  when  within  they  are  full  of 
envy  and  malice.  S.  Chrysostom  in  the  Catena : “Christ  rightly 
called  him  a hypocrite,  because  he  had  the  face  of  one  who  observed 
the  law  carefully,  but  the  mind  of  cunning  and  envy.  He  was  not 
disturbed  for  the  Sabbath  and  its  violation,  but  because  of  Christ, 
because  He  obtained  glory.”  I have  treated  the  subject  at  length, 
Ecclus.  L 37,  on  the  words  nefuerisy  and  ii.  14,  Vce  duplici. 

This  daughter  of  Abraham.  The  argument  of  Christ  is  most 
applicable  and  forcible,  showing  that  the  healing  was  not  a servile 
act,  but  one  liberal  and  divine,  and  therefore,  not  only  not  unworthy, 
but- rather  most  worthy,  of  the  Sabbath — for  the  Sabbath,  nay,  even 
God  Himself,  the  author  of  it,  was  wonderfully  sanctified  and  made 
glorious,  as  S.  Irenaeus  shows  when  he  says  that,  “ Christ,  in  heal- 
ing the  sick  on  the  Sabbath  day,  acted  not  contrarily  but  according 
to  the  law.”  Christ  then  compares,  opposes,  and  prefers  the 
bond  and  release  of  the  woman  to  the  bond  and  release  of  the 
ox  and  ass. 

Again,  every  word  contains  a pregnant  antithesis.  In  the  first 
Christ  compares,  and  prefers  the  woman,  as  a daughter  of  Abraham, 
to  the  ox  or  ass.  2.  He  compares  and  prefers  the  spiritual  bond 
and  deliverance  of  the  woman  to  those  of  the  ox  and  ass.  3.  The 
woman  had  suffered  this  bondage  for  eighteen  years.  The  ox  had

borne  its  tether,  and  therefore  its  thirst,  only  an  hour  or  two.  4. 
The  setting  of  the  ox  free  was  a long  and  troublesome  work,  but  the 
healing  of  the  woman  was  the  act  of  a moment,  in  which  the  obliga- 
tion of  the  Sabbath  could  in  no  way  be  violated.  5.  By  this  release 
the  woman  was  restored  to  perfect  health  and  sanctity,  but  the  ox 
only  drank  a little  draught  of  water.  Lastly,  He  convicts  the  ruler 
and  the  Pharisees  of  inhumanity,  because,  in  the  words  of  Bede, 
“ he  postponed  the  healing  of  a human  being  to  care  of  cattle.” 

The  glorious  things  that  were  done  by  Him.  The  Syraic — In  all 
the  miracles  which  were  done  by  His  hand. 

Ver.  18. — Then  said  He.  The  word  M then  ” is  illative,  as  is 
shown  by  what  precedes  and  follows.  Christ  saw  that  He  had 
silenced  His  enemies,  the  Pharisees,  by  His  wisdom,  and  that  the 
people  rejoiced  and  praised  both  Himself  and  His  word.  When 
He  saw  them  thus  rightly  disposed,  He  proposed  to  them  the 
l>arable  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven  \ for  He  saw  that  the  way  was 
now  prepared  for  proclaiming  this,  and  for  His  preaching — that  He 
might  incite  all  to  attempt  its  attainment,  and  therefore  to  receive 
His  evangelical  doctrine  and  life.  I have  explained  the  parable  on 
S.  Matt  xiii.  31. 

Ver.  23. — Then  said  one  unto  Him,  Lord,  are  there  few  that  be

as  S.  Luke  signifies  and  S.  Matt,  plainly  states,  viL  14.  Isaiah 
speaks  to  the  same  effect,  x.  22 ; xxiv.  13.  Understand  “few”  by  a 
comparison  of  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  whole  world ; or  of  the  faith- 
ful with  the  unbelieving,  for  all  the  latter  are  condemned  for  their 
unbelief,  and  equally  many  of  the  faithful  for  their  wicked  lives. 
The  faithful  alone  are  saved,  and  not  all  of  these.  But  whether  the 
greater  number  of  them  are  saved  or  lost  is  the  question.  Some 
think  that  the  greater  number  are  saved,  through  the  holy  sacra- 
ments (which  very  many  of  them  only  receive  at  the  end  of  their 
Jives).  Others  think  that  most  are  lost  because  they  live  in  a state 
of  mortal  sin.  The  rule  of  S.  Augustine  is  that  as  men  have  lived, 
so  they  die.  Of  these  opinions  I have  shown  which  is  the  true  one, 
on  S.  James  ii.  13,  on  the  words  '*  Mercy  rejoiceth  against  judg-

CHRIST’S  FEARLESSNESS.

menu"  The  judgment  of  S.  Chrysostom,  Homily  xL  to  the 
Antiochenes,  who  numbered  100,000  or  more,  is  formidable.  " In 
our  city,”  he  says,  “among  so  many  thousands,  scarcely  can  100  be 
found  who  will  be  saved,  for  in  the  youngers  is  great  wickedness, 
and  in  the  elders  deadness.”  And  S.  Augustine  (Bk.  iv.  ch.  53,  against 
Dresconius)  compares  the  Church  to  a threshing-floor,  on  which 
there  is  much  more  chaff  than  grain,  i.e.  more  reprobate  than  elect 

Ver  31. — The  same  day  there  came  certain  of  the  Pharisees , saying, ; 
Herod  will  kill  Thee9  as  he  slew  John  Thy  forerunner.  Christ  seems 
not  to  have  preached  in  Galilee  at  this  time,  as  He  had  previously 
left  it  (Matt,  xix.),  but  in  Perea  in  Judaea,  for  Herod  ruled  over 
Perea  as  well  as  Galilee.  So  thinks  F.  Lucas.  Maldonatus  and 
others,  however,  suppose  that  these  things  were  done  in  Galilee, 
that  S.  Luke  may  now  insert  by  recapitulation  what  had  been  done 
there  previously,  as  we  find  in  ver.  24  and  chap.  ix.  51. 

Moreover  the  Pharisees,  by  this  falsehood,  pretended  that  Herod 
was  hostile  to  Christ,  that  they  might  banish  Him  from  among  them, 
or  at  least  that  they  might  test  His  freedom  and  conscience  and 
depress  Him  by  implanting  in  his  mind  the  fear  of  Herod,  and 
might  thus  drive  Him  out  of  their  country.  “ Lest,”  says  Euthymius, 
“ by  His  presence  and  miracles  He  might  gain  fame  and  attract  a 
multitude.”  And  perhaps,  when  going  from  Perea  to  Judaea,  He 
might  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  chief  Priests,  whom  they  knew  to 
be  contriving  His  death,  as  is  plain  from  S.  John  vii  20.  25.  Herod, 
indeed,  was  not  opposed  to  Christ,  for  he  desired  to  see  Him  and  His 
miracles,  as  in  chap.  ix.  9 ; nay,  he  would  not  condemn  Christ  when 
Christ  was  sent  to  him  by  Pilate,  but  sent  Him  back  to  Pilate  clad  in 
a white  (alba,  Vulg.,  Xdftwpc,  Greek)  robe,  as  if  He  were  worthy  of 
ridicule  and  not  death,  chap.  xxiiL  So  Jansenius,  Maldonatus,  F. 
Lucas  and  others. 

Ver.  32. — And  He  said  to  them  Christ  answered  the  Pharisees  freely 
and  loftily  when  they  brought  up  the  fear  of  Herod.  He  said  that 
He  feared  neither  Herod,  nor  the  Pharisees,  nor  the  rulers,  but  He 
would  continue  to  preach,  though  against  the  will  of  them  all,  until 
the  day  appointed  by  the  Father  for  His  death.  He  called  Herod

S.  LUKE,  C.  XITI. 


•‘a  fox/'  because  he  was  cunning,  crafty,  (versipellis)  and  false,  for  he 
killed  John  the  Baptist  by  fraud  and  falsehood.  Such  are  heretics 
the  type  of  whom  was  Herod,  for  they  seek  to  kill  those  who  believe, 
in  Christ 

But  Christ  here  rather  addresses  the  Pharisees,  and  calls  them 
all  foxes  because  they  would  have  instilled  a false  fear  of  Herod 
into  His  mind,  that  in  flying  from  Judaea  He  might  be  taken  by 
the  rulers  and  put  to  death.  Titus  says  that  “ He  appears,  as  some 
think,  to  direct  the  whole  force  of  His  words  against  Herod  alone,  but 
He  turns  them  against  the  wickedness  of  the  Pharisees  rather  than 
Herod,  for  He  did  not  say  * that  fox,'  but  * this  fox.’ ” In  fact,  to 
show  that  the  Pharisees  resembled  foxes  by  their  pretended  fraud, 
He  carefully  used  a middle  term,  and,  as  S.  Theophylact  says,  “with 
intention,”  for  by  saying  “fox”  in  the  singular  He  made  them 
think  that  He  meant  Herod,  but  by  the  addition  of  the  demon- 
strative pronoun  “ this,”  He  signified  that  they  themselves  were  the 
crafty  ones. 

Thus  Emmanuel  Sk : “The  word  ‘that*  may  apply  either  to 
Herod  or  to  him  who  invented  the  falsehood  that  Herod  wished  to 
kill  Christ;  and  who  must  have  been  one  of  the  Pharisees,  the 
enemies  of  Christ  The  meaning  then  is,  You  Pharisees,  like  crafty 
and  deceitful  foxes,  would  fill  Me  with  the  fear  of  Herod,  that  I may 
no  longer  preach  among  you;  but  I forewarn  you  that  I fear 
neither  you  nor  Herod,  nor  will  I,  for  any  reason,  cease  to  preach ; 
for  I am  sure  that  my  Father  will  not  suffer  Me  to  be  taken  and  put 
to  death  before  the  day  appointed  by  Him  shall  have  arrived.” 

Behold,  least  out  devils — I proceed  to  perform  my  work  against 
the  will  not  only  of  Herod  but  of  you — today  and  to-morrow,  that  is, 
for  some  time  yet,  and  the  third  day,  that  is,  in  a short  time,  when 
I shall  have  finished  my  ministry  and  preaching,  I shall  be  perfected, 
i.e.  “ I shall  receive  my  consummation  in  a glorious  death  on  the 
cross,  undergone  by  me  willingly  and  courageously  for  the  salvation 
of  men,”  as  the  Apostle  says,  Hebrews  xi. 

Observe  the  Hebraism  by  which  an  indefinite  time  is  put  for  a 
definite,  as  in  Hosea  vi  2.  So  S.  Cvril  and  Theophylact.  Euthymius

CHRIST’S  CONSTANCY  IN  HIS  MISSION. 


343 


says,  “ To-day ; and  therefore  to-morrow ; that  is,  for  some  time 
yet,  though  a short  one,  that  is  about  three  months,”  for  Christ 
appears  to  have  said  this  a little  before  the  Feast  of  Dedication, 
which  is  kept  upon  the  25th  of  the  month  Casleu,  which  answers  to 
part  of  our  November  and  December,  and  He  was  crucified  in  the 
following  March. 

Christ  therefore  boldly  said  this  to  the  Pharisees  to  show,  1.  That 
He  feared  not  death  but  sought  it  2 . To  show  His  Divine  Power, 
by  which  He  would  live  among  then,  and  teach  them,  even  against 
their  will,  as  long  as  the  Father  and  Himself  pleased  and  determined. 
3.  To  increase  the  vexation  of  the  perverse  Pharisees,  for  they 
already  wished  for  His  destruction. 

Christ  also  calls  His  death  “a  consummation,”  because  in  it  and 
by  it  He  consummated  the  whole  ooconomy  of  His  Incarnation, 
and  the  whole  work  of  the  mission  on  which  He  was  sent  by  the 
Father,  that  is,  the  expiation  of  all  sins,  the  redemption  of  the 
human  race,  the  salvation  of  the  elect ; as  in  Hebrews  x.  14. 

Ver.  33. — Nevertheless  I must  walk,1  * Must,”  says  S.  Bonaventure, 
“ not  from  compulsion  but  from  Divine  decree.”  So  S.  Cyril,  and 
Titus.  Christ  repeats  this  (which  He  had  said  in  the  preceding 
verse)  to  show  that  He  was  constant  in  fearing  neither  Herod  nor 
the  Pharisees,  and  in  His  determination  to  preach,  against  their  will, 
for  a short  time  still,  to  the  day  appointed  by  the  Father.  The  mean- 
ing is : “ To-day  and  to-morrow,  and  the  third  day  following  I must 
walk  in  the  towns  and  villages,  and  preach,  and  on  that  third  day 
following,  that  is  soon  after,  be  perfected  by  death  on  the  cross,  as 
I have  already  said.  I now  add  that  on  the  third  day  I shall  do 
the  same,  for  although  I shall  be  perfected  on  this  day,  yet  on  this 
day  also  I must  walk.  All  the  time  of  my  life,  even  to  my  death, 
I must  walk  in  this  country,  and  preach,  and  work  cures,  and  cast 
out  devils,  because  I have  consecrated  my  whole  life  to  holy  actions, 
and  my  death  to  generous  suffering ; for  I have  offered  myself  to 
God  as  a holocaust”  In  Hebrew  “ to  walk  ” is  taken  for  “ to  work 
S.  John  viii.  12.,  xii  35;  Ps.  i.  1,  and  elsewhere.  The  Syriac  has, 
“ I must  walk  to-day  and  to-morrow,  and  on  the  third  day  I shall

make  my  journey,”  i.e.  I shall  set  out  to  Jerusalem  to  my  death,  and 
thence  to  Heaven  from  which  I came. 

Morally , the  faithful,  and  especially  the  apostolic  man,  may 
learn  to  labour  strenuously  in  the  Lord’s  vineyard  even  to  death 
and  martyrdom,  like  SS.  Peter,  Paul,  Chrysostom,  Athanasius  and 
others.  So  our  own  Father  Canisius,  though  worn  out  by  many  and 
great  labours,  yet  ceased  not  from  them  until  his  seventy-seventh 
year,  when  he  was  released  at  once  from  them  and  from  his  life. 

These  were  his  words.  “ To  the  soldiers  of  Christ,”  their  term  of 
service  (stipendia)  is  not  finished  till  the  end  of  their  lives.  When 
they  have  ended  then  they  begin:  death  alone  gives  them  their 
discharge.  There  is  one  abode  for  those  who  have  merited  it, 
heaven.  So  our  own  Sacchinus  in  Bk.  iiL  of  his  life:  “Let  us 
labour  therefore  even  to  death,  that  after  death  we  may  rest  for 
ever  in  a blessed  felicity;  for  earth  is  the  course  (stadium)  of  a 
little  labour,  heaven  is  the  seat  of  eternal  repose.” 

For  it  cannot  be  that  a prophet  should  perish  out  of  Jerusalem.  In 
the  Greek  •&*  bdtyirai ; that  is,  it  is  not  fitting,  it  does  not  happen. 
* It  cannot  be  done  ” is  read  by  the  Syriac  It  is  a hyperbole  It 
means,  “ Such  is  the  wickedness  and  barbarity  of  Jerusalem,  that  it 
seems  proper  to  her  that  the  prophets  should  be  killed  by  herself, 
nay,  she  will  not  suffer  this  to  be  done  by  any  other,  but  takes  it 
amiss  if  it  be  I do  not  fear  Herod  therefore,  whom  you  cast  up 
to  Me,  because  I shall  not  be  put  to  death  by  him  now  in  Galilee, 
but  some  months  hence  in  Jerusalem,  the  murderess  of  the  prophets, 
where,  not  by  Herod,  but  by  yourselves,  O Pharisees,  I shall  be 
crucified  and  slain.”  “ For  they  were  accustomed,”  says  S.  Theophy- 
lact,  “to  pour  out  the  blood  of  the  servants,  even  as  they  poured 
out  that  of  the  Lord  Himself.”  So  Titus,  Jansenius,  Maldonatus, 
and  F.  Lucas.  The  last  named  says : “ It  cannot  be  that  a prophet 
should  be  slain  outside  Jerusalem,  he  must  be  slain  within  it;  not 
because  none  were  slain  outside,  for  Jezebel  slew  many  in  Samaria, 
i.  Kings  xviii.  13,  xix.  10,  but  as  it  was  most  usual  for  their  slaughter 
to  take  place  within  the  walls.  For  the  kings  had  their  abode  there, 
and  the  rulers,  the  nobles,  the  scribes,  the  wise  men,  and  the

" JERUSALEM,  WHICH  KILLEST  THE  PROPHETS.”  345 

Pharisees,  holy  in  their  own  eyes,  who,  like  the  people,  would  not 
endure  the  rebukes  and  admonitions  of  the  prophets ; so  that  the 
city  was  changed  from  the  house  of  God,  into  the  slaughter-house 
of  the  prophets,  and  professed  to  be,  as  it  were,  their  place  of 
torture.  We  read,  2 Kings  xxi.  16,  “Manasseh  shed  innocent 
blood  very  much,  till  he  had  filled  Jerusalem  from  one  end  to 
another.” 

In  like  manner  at  Rome,  in  various  places,  and  especially  at  the 
Ursus  Pileatus,  where  is  now  the  Church  of  S.  Bibiana,  a great  number 
of  Christians  were  slain  by  the  unbelieving  Emperors : so  that  the 
place  obtained  the  vulgar  name  of  u The  Shambles  of  the  Martyrs.” 
Thus  it  might  then  have  been  said  with  truth,  " It  is  not  possible 
that  a Pope  should  be  killed  out  of  Rome,  for  almost  all  the  Popes, 
from  S.  Peter  to  Silvester,  for  300  years,  were  put  to  death  by  the 
Emperors  at  Rome  for  the  faith  of  Christ”

CHAPTER  XIV. 

2  Christ  healeth  the  dropsy  oh  the  sabbath : 7 teacheth  humility : 12  to  feast  the 
poor : 15  under  the  parable  of  the  great  supper ; sheweth  how  worldly  minded 
men , who  contemn  the  word  of  Godt  shall  be  shut  out  of  heaven  : 25  those  who 
will  be  his  disciples , to  bear  their  cross  must  make  their  accounts  aforehand9  lest 
with  shame  they  revolt  from  him  afterwards , 34  and  become  altogether  unpro- 
fitable,, like  salt  that  hath  lost  his  savour . 

AND  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  went  into  the  house  of  one  of  the  chief  Pharisees 
to  eat  bread  on  the  sabbath  day,  that  they  watched  him. 

2 And,  behold,  there  was  a certain  man  before  him  which  had  the  dropsy. 

3  And  Jesus  answering  spake  unto  the  lawyers  and  Pharisees,  saying,  Is  it 
lawful  to  heal  on  the  sabbath  day? 

4  And  they  held  their  peace.  And  he  took  him , and  healed  him,  and  let 
him  go ; 

5  And  answered  them,  saying,  Which  of  you  shall  have  an  ass  or  an  ox  fallen 
into  a pit,  and  will  not  straightway  pull  him  out  on  the  sabbath  day  ? 

6  And  they  could  not  answer  him  again  to  these  things. 

7  H And  he  put  forth  a parable  to  those  which  were  bidden,  when  he  marked 
how  they  chose  out  the  chief  rooms ; saying  unto  them, 

8  When  thou  art  bidden  of  any  mdn  to  a wedding,  sit  not  down  in  the  highest 
room  ; lest  a more  honourable  man  than  thou  be  bidden  of  him  ; 

9  And  he  that  bade  thee  and  him  come  and  say  to  thee,  Give  this  man  place  ; 
and  thou  begin  with  shame  to  take  the  lowest  room. 

10  But  when  thou  art  bidden,  go  and  sit  down  in  the  lowest  room ; that  when 
he  that  bade  thee  cometh,  he  may  say  unto  thee,  Friend,  go  up  higher : then 
shalt  thou  have  worship  in  the  presence  of  them  that  sit  at  meat  with  thee. 

1 1  For  whosoever  exalteth  himself  shall  be  abased ; and  he  that  humbleth 
himself  shall  be  exalted. 

12  IT  Then  said  he  also  to  him  that  bade  him,  When  thou  makest  a dinner  or 
a supper,  call  not  thy  friends,  nor  thy  brethren,  neither  thy  kinsmen,  nor  thy 
rich  neighbours  ; lest  they  also  bid  thee  again,  and  a recompence  be  made  thee. 

13  But  when  thou  makest  a feast,  call  the  poor,  the  maimed,  the  lame,  the 
blind : 

14  And  thou  shalt  be  blessed;  for  they  cannot  recompense  thee:  for  thou 
shalt  be  recompensed  at  the  resurrection  of  the  just. 

15  H And  when  one  of  them  that  sat  at  meat  with  him  heard  these  things,  he 
said  unto  him.  Blessed  is  he  that  shall  eat  bread  in  the  kingdom  of  God. 

16  Then  said  he  unto  him,  A certain  man  made  a great  supper,  and  bade 
many  :

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  S.  LUKE.  347 

17  And  sent  his  servant  at  supper  time  to  say  to  them  that  were  bidden,  Come; 
for  all  things  are  now  ready. 

iS  And  they  all  with  one  consent  began  to  make  excuse.  The  first  said  unto 
him,  I have  bought  a piece  of  ground,  and  I must  needs  go  and  see  it : I pray 
thee  have  me  excused. 

19  And  another  said,  I have  bought  five  yoke  of  oxen,  and  I go  to  prove  them  s 
I pray  thee  have  me  excused. 

20  And  another  said,  I have  married  a wife,  and  therefore  I cannot  come. 

21  So  that  servant  came,  and  shewed  his  lord  these  things.  Then  the  master 
of  the  house  being  angry  said  to  his  servant,  Go  out  quickly  into  the  streets  and 
lanes  of  the  city,  and  bring  in  hither  the  poor,  and  the  maimed,  and  the  halt,  and 
the  blind. 

22  And  the  servant  said,  Lord,  it  is  done  as  thou  hast  commanded,  and  yet 
there  is  room. 

23  And  the  lord  said  unto  the  servant,  Go  out  into  the  highways  and  hedges, 
and  compel  them  to  come  in,  that  my  house  may  be  filled. 

24  For  I say  unto  you.  That  none  of  those  men  which  were  bidden  shall  taste 
of  my  supper. 

25  1 And  there  went  great  multitudes  with  him  : and  he  turned,  and  said  unto 
them, 

26  If  any  man  come  to  me,  and  hate  not  his  father,  and  mother,  and  wife,  and 
children,  and  brethren,  and  sisters,  yea,  and  hit  own  life  also,  he  cannot  be  my 
disciple. 

2 7 And  whosoever  doth  not  bear  his  cross,  and  come  after  me,  cannot  be  my 
disciple. 

28  For  which  of  you,  intending  to  build  a tower,  sitteth  not  down  first,  and 
counteth  the  cost,  whether  he  have  sufficient  to  finish  it  f 

29  Lest  haply,  after  he  hath  laid  the  foundation,  and  is  not  able  to  finish  it , 
all  that  behold  it  begin  to  mock  him, 

30  Saying,  This  man  began  to  build,  and  was  not  able  to  finish. 

31  Or  what  king,  going  to  make  war  against  another  king,  sitteth  not  down 
first,  and  consulteth  whether  he  be  able  with  ten  thousand  to  meet  him  that 
cometh  against  him  with  twenty  thousand  ? 

32  Or  else,  while  the  other  is  yet  a great  way  off,  he  sendeth  an  ambassage, 
and  desireth  conditions  of  peace. 

33  So  likewise,  whosoever  he  be  of  you  that  forsaketh  not  all  that  he  hath,  he 
cannot  be  my  disciple. 

34  1 Salt  is  good : but  if  the  salt  have  lost  his  savour,  wherewith  shall  it  be 
seasoned? 

35  It  is  neither  fit  for  the  land,  nor  yet  for  the  dunghill ; but  men  cast  it  out. 
He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear. 

Ver.  1. — And  it  came  to  pass  that  He  went  into  the  house  of  one  of 
the  chief  Pharisees . “ To  do  them  service,”  says  Titus,  “ Christ  makes 
Himself  their  friend,  and,  as  it  were,  one  of  their  household,”  for 
“ although  He  knew  the  malice  of  the  Pharisees,  yet  He  became 
their  guest  that  He  might  benefit  by  His  words  and  miracles  those

who  were  present,  and  teach  them  the  lawfulness  of  healing  on  the 
Sabbath,  and  the  respective  duties  of  entertainers  and  guests.” 

Ver.  2. — And  behold  there  was  a certain  man  before  Him  which  had 
the  dropsy.  This  man  seems  to  have  been  a friend  of  the  Pharisee^  who 
perhaps  had  invited  Jesus  in  order  that  He  might  heal  him.  Certainly, 
as  S.  Cyril  and  Euthymius  say,  the  sufferer  presented  himself  of  his  own 
accord  to  Jesus,  silently  pleading  that  he  might  be  restored  to  health. 
But  the  Pharisees  sought  His  presence  for  another  purpose,  in  order 
that  they  might  see  whether  Christ  would  heal  him  on  the  Sabbath 
day,  and  thus  show  that  He  was  not  in  truth  a prophet  sent  by  that 
God  who  had  sanctified  the  rigid  observance  of  the  seventh  day. 

Ver.  3.  And  Jesus  answering  spake  unto  the  lawyers  and  Pharisees. 
Answering  their  thoughts  and  not  their  inquiry,  for  they  had  asked 
no  question,  but  thought  in  their  hearts  that  Christ  would  be  acting 
unlawfully  if  He  healed  on  the  Sabbath  day. 

Ver.  4. — And  He  took  him,  and  healed  him,  and  let  him 
“ when  He  had  touched  him,”  apprehensum,  Vulg.)  He  heals  by 
His  touch  the  dropsical  man  who,  from  fear  of  the  Pharisees,  did 
not  ask  to  be  healed  on  account  of  the  Sabbath,  but  only  stood  up, 
that  when  Jesus  beheld  him  He  might  have  compassion  on  him  and 
heal  him.  & Cyril 

Mystically \ S.  Gregory  (lib.  xiv.  Moral.)  observes : “ The  sick  of 
the  dropsy  is  healed  in  the  Pharisee’s  presence,  for  by  the  bodily 
infirmity  of  the  one  is  expressed  the  mental  disease,  is.  the  avarice 
and  covetousness,  of  the  other.”  “For,”  says  Bede,  "the  dropsical 
man  represents  one  who  is  weighed  down  by  an  overflowing  stream 
of  carnal  pleasures.”  S.  Augustine  adds,  “ We  lightly  compare  one 
sick  of  the  dropsy  to  a covetous  rich  man,  who,  the  more  he  abounds 
in  riches,  the  more  ardently  desires  them.  Avarice  and  covetous* 
ness,  then,  are  very  similar  to  the  dropsy,  and  as  this  dire  disease 
is  best  remedied  by  abstaining  from  drinking,  so  the  remedy  for 
unlawful  desire  is  mortification,  abstinence,  and  continence,  all  of 
which  wither  and  drive  out  virtuous  habits.” 

Ver.  5. — And  He  answered  them,  saying,  Which  cf  you,  &c.  “If/ 
says  Bede,  “ye  hasten  on  the  Sabbath  to  pull  an  ox  or  an  ass  out

CURE  OF  THE  DROPSICAL  MAN.

of  the  pit  into  which  he  has  fallen,  consulting  not  the  good  of 
the  animal,  but  your  own  avarice,  how  much  more  ought  I to 
deliver  a man  who  is  much  better  than  a beast  ? ” He  adds  also, 
“ they  were  not  to  violate  the  Sabbath  by  a work  of  coveteousness, 
who  were  aiguing  that  He  did  so  by  a work  of  charity.”  And  again, 
in  a mystical  sense,  the  ox  and  the  ass  represent  the  wise  and  the 
foolish,  or  the  Jew  oppressed  by  the  burden  of  the  Law  and  the 
Gentile  not  subject  to  reason.  For  the  Lord  rescues  from  the 
pit  of  concupiscence  all  who  are  sunk  therein.” 

5.  Augustine  also  {Lib.  ii.  Quasi.  Evang.)  says,  “He  has  aptly 
compared  the  dropsical  man  to  an  animal  which  has  fallen  into  a 
ditch  (for  he  is  troubled  by  water),  as  He  compared  that  woman 
whom  He  loosed,  to  a beast  which  is  let  loose  to  be  led  to  water.” 

6.  And  they  amid  not  answer  Him  again  to  these  things.  Because 
they  were  convinced  by  the  truth  of  His  reasoning.  Yet  privately  they 
murmured  amongst  themselves,  and  afterwards  openly  clamoured 
amongst  the  people.  “This  man  is  not  of  God,  because  he 
keepeth  not  the  Sabbath  day,”  S.  John  ix.  16.  Although  Jesus 
knew  this,  He  healed  the  man,  and  permitted  their  malice  and 
obstinacy  to  gather  force,  so  that  the  cross  ordained  for  Him 
by  God  might  be  prepared  for  the  salvation  of  men.  “Caring 
nought,”  says  Theophylact,  “for  the  offence  given  to  the  Pharisees.” 
For  when  a great  good  is  the  result,  we  must  not  care  if  the  foolish 
are  offended. 

Ver.  7.  And  He  put  forth  a parable  to  those  which  were  bidden , 
i.e.  He  taught,  under  the  similitude  of  a man  seeking  the  highest 
place  at  a feast,  that  we  must  beware  of  every  kind  of  ambition.  For 
sin  continues  to  be  sin,  although  the  manner  of  sinning  be  changed. 

“ When  He  marked  how  they  chose  out  the  chief  rooms.”  For  as 
teachers  of  the  Law,  they  considered  themselves  entitled  to  the 
highest  honour,  and  fought  for  precedence  as  eagerly  as  now-a-days 
ladies  of  rank  and  men  of  small  brains. 

This  is  a kind  of  introduction  to  the  parable,  and  indicates  the 
occasion  on  which  it  was  spoken,  and  the  persons  against  whom  it 
was  directed.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XIV. 


Ver.  8. — When  thou  art  bidden  ...  sit  not  down  in  the  highest  room. 
For  when  the  master  of  the  house  takes  your  place  from  you  to  give 
it  to  a more  honourable  guest,  those  who  sit  next  in  order  will  not 
give  way  to  your  ambition,  and  you  will  begin  with  shame  to  go  down 
from  the  highest  to  the  lowest  room.  Do  not  unduly  exalt  thyself 
lest  some  one,  offended  by  thy  insolence,  humble  it  and  lay  it  low. 

Ver.  10. — Go  and  sit  down  in  the  lowest  room.  The  master  of  the 
house  usually  assigned  to  each  guest  his  place  at  the  table,  a duty 
formerly  discharged  by  the  “ ruler  of  the  feast,”  regard  being  had  to 
each  one’s  age  and  social  standing.  Thus  Joseph’s  brethren  “ sat 
before  him,  the  first-born  according  to  his  birthright,  and  the 
youngest  according  to  his  youth”  Gen.  xliil  33.  In  this  verse, 
Christ  makes  evident  allusion  to  the  saying  of  Solomon,  “ Put  not 
forth  thyself  in  the  presence  of  the  king,”  &c  (Prov.  xxv.  6,  7). 
Titus  very  justly  remarks,  that  44  a wise  man,  however  deserving 
he  may  be  of  the  highest  place,  so  little  affects  it,  as  to  give  it  up 
to  others  of  his  own  accord.  Wherefore  a mind  modest  and  content 
with  its  own  lot  is  a great  and  a glorious  gift” 

Then  shall  thou  have  worship.  Christ  teaches  that  if  we  would 
acquire  glory  and  greatness,  we  must  fly  from  them  and  be  humble ; 
for  men  hate  the  proud  and  seek  to  humiliate  them,  but  make  much 
of  the  modest  and  meek  ; the  true  glory  is  that  which  is  given,  not 
that  which  is  sought : furthermore,  God  has  decreed  by  an  eternal 
law  that  the  humble  should  be  exalted,  but  that  the  mighty  should 
be  put  down  from  their  seat  Wherefore,  the  proud,  if  they  are  wise, 
will  humble  themselves,  that  they  may  have  worship  in  the  presence 
of  them  that  sit  at  meat  with  them.  Knowing  that  if  they  seek  the 
most  honourable  places,  they  will  excite  envy,  and  men  will  strive, 
whether  rightly  or  wrongly,  to  humiliate  them. 

Hear  what  the  wise  man  says,  “The  greater  thou  art,  the  more 
humble  thyself  and  thou  shalt  find  favour  before  the  Lord.* 
(Ecclus.  iii.  20.) 

This  precept  of  Christ,  or  rather  this  wise  dogma,  was  recognised 
and  taught  by  the  Gentile  philosophers.  So  Plutarch  introduces 
Thales  thus  sharply  rebuking  the  pride  of  Alexidemus,  who,

because  he  was  the  son  of  Thrasybulus  had  rushed  from  the  ban- 
queting hall  at  seeing  others  seated  above  him:  “ Fearest  thou 
lest  thy  place  at  table  shall  bring  thee  glory  or  obscurity  after  the 
manner  of  the  stars,  which,  as  the  Egyptians  say,  wax  and  wane 
according  to  the  places  wherein  they  rise  or  set  ? Thou  art  not  so 
wise  as  the  man,  who,  when  the  leader  assigned  him  the  lowest 
place  in  a chorus,  said,  Thou  hast  done  well  in  having  discovered 
a means  of  making  even  a position  such  as  this  honourable.  For 
he  was  of  opinion  that  a man  is  not  distinguished  by  his  position, 
but  rather  the  position  by  the  man.” 

Honour,  like  the  shadow  cast  by  the  body,  follows  him  that  die 
from  it,  but  flees  from  him  that  follows  it 

Symbolically . Members  of  religious  orders,  according  to  the 
words  of  Christ,  “ sit  down  in  the  lowest  room.”  For  they  who  have 
kept  nothing,  but  given  up  all,  even  their  very  will,  have  no  lower 
place  to  which  they  can  betake  themselves.  Here  they  are  at  rest, 
for  their  humility  is  not  limited,  like  that  of  other  men,  to  this  or 
that  action,  but  is  life-long ; for  it  is  a part  of  their  profession  which 
embraces  their  whole  life. 

Ver.  i x. — For  whosoever  exalteth  himself  shall  be  abased , &c,  both 
by  God  and  man,  often  in  this  life,  always  in  the  life  to  come. 
This  verse  explains  the  meaning  and  scope  of  the  parable.  See  & 
Matt  xxiiL  12. 

Ver.  12. — Then  said  He  also  unto  him  that  bade  Him,  i.e.  to  the 
chief  Pharisee  mentioned  in  the  first  verse,  whose  hospitality  Christ 
recompensed  by  the  spiritual  banquet  of  ghostly  counsel  and  advice. 
This  man,  says  the  Gloss,  seems  to  have  invited  his  guests  in  order 
that  he  in  turn  might  be  entertained  by  them. 

M Call  not  thy  friends Christ  counselled  this  as  the  more  per- 
fect way.  He  did  not  command  it  as  of  necessity.  For  it  is  lawful, 
nay,  meritorious,  for  us  to  invite  our  friends,  if  it  be  done  out  of 
friendship  and  kindness.  Whence  Bede  says,  “ Brethren  then,  and 
friends,  and  the  rich  are  not  forbidden,  as  though  it  were  a crime,  to 
entertain  one  another,  but  this,  like  all  the  other  necessary  inter- 
course among  men,  is  shown  to  fail  in  meriting  the  reward  of  ever

lasting  life,”  unless,  as  I have  said,  such  entertainment  springs  from 
a higher  motive  of  brotherly  love  or  charity. 

u Lest  they  also  bid  thee  again Like  worldly  men  are  wont  to 
do  from  gratitude  or  else  avarice,  for  “ to  be  hospitable  to  those  who 
will  make  a return,  is,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ but  a form  of  avarice.” 

“ And  a recompmce  be  made  thee  ” by  man,  and  this  prove 
worthless  and  transient.  If  you  regard  this  alone,  you  exclude  the 
spiritual  recompence  from  God  and  deprive  yourself  of  it ; if  you  look 
for  both  you  will  receive  both,  but  both  lessened,  for  the  one  lessens 
and  as  it  were  interferes  with  the  other ; but  if  you  regard  the  divine 
alone,  and  only  admit  or  rather  bear  with  the  human  recompence 
because  it  is  offered  you,  you  will  receive  the  divine  whole  and 
undiminished. 

Ver.  13. — But  when  thou  makes t a /east,  call  the  poor , the  maimed , 
the  lamef  the  blind.  “ The  maimed,”  dvavi j*©uc,  the  cripple,  the  muti- 
lated, i.e.  those  wanting  in  body  or  mind.  S.  Chrysostom  assigns  the 
reason.  “ If  ye  invite  the  poor,  God  will  be  your  debtor.  For  the 
humbler  the  brother  is,  so  much  the  more  does  Christ  come 
through  him  and  visit  us.  For  he  who  entertains  a great  man  does 
it  often  from  an  interested  motive  or  from  vainglory.  But  thou 
sayest,  the  poor  man  is  unclean  and  filthy.  Wash  him  and  make 
him  sit  with  thee  at  table.  If  he  has  dirty  garments,  give  him  clean 
ones.  If  thou  will  not  receive  him  in  a quiet  chamber,  at  least 
admit  him  where  thy  servants  are.  If  thou  art  not  willing  that  he 
should  sit  at  meat  with  thee,  send  him  a dish  from  thy  table.” 

Following  this  counsel,  S.  Gregory  had  often  twelve  beggars  at  his 
table,  and  therefore  was  rewarded  by  receiving  Christ  Himself  in  the 
guise  of  a poor  man.  S.  Louis  of  France  also,  not  content  with 
entertaining  120  beggars  at  his  table  daily,  and  on  feast  days  200, 
frequently  waited  upon  them  himself,  and  even  washed  their  feet  In 
like  manner  acted  S.  Louis  the  Minorite,  Bishop  of  Toulouse,  fol- 
lowing the  example  of  his  uncle  S.  Louis;  S.  Hedwig,  Duchess 
of  Poland,  and  her  niece  S.  Elizabeth,  the  daughter  of  Andrew 
king  of  Hungary,  who  fed  900  poor  every  day,  receiving  a nch 
reward  in  divine  favour  and  grace.

PARABLE  OF  THE  GREAT  SUPPER. 


353 


Mystically . Origen  says,  “ He  who  shuns  vainglory,  calls  to  a spiritual 
banquet  the  poor,  that  is,  the  ignorant,  that  he  may  enrich  them ; the 
weak,  that  is,  those  with  offended  consciences,  that  he  may  heal  them; 
the  lame,  that  is,  those  who  have  wandered  from  reason,  that  he  may 
make  their  paths  straight ; the  blind,  that  they  may  discern  the  truth.” 

Ver.  14 — And  thou  shalt  be  blessed,  for  thou  shalt  be  recompensed 
at  the  resurrection  of  the  just,  when,  says  the  Interlinear,  the  enter- 
tainers of  the  poor  will  enter  into  blessedness. 

The  neediness  of  the  guests  purifies  the  intention  of  the  host,  who 
expects  no  return  from  them,  but  acts  solely  out  of  love  to  God. 
Wherefore  God,  who  considers  that  what  is  done  to  the  poor  is  done 
unto  Him,  will  grant  him  a bounteous  reward,  even  the  everlasting 
delights  of  the  heavenly  banquet,  according  to  the  promise,  “ and 
I appoint  unto  you  . . . that  ye  may  eat  and  drink  at  my  table  in 
my  kingdom.”  S.  Luke  xxii.  29.  Hence  S.  Chrysostom  says,  “ Let  us 
be  troubled  not  when  we  receive  no  return  of  a kindness,  but  when 
we  do ; for  if  we  have  received  it,  we  shall  receive  nothing  more ; but 
if  man  does  not  repay  us,  God,  out  of  love  for  whom  we  have  acted, 
will  be  our  recompense.” 

Ver.  15.  Blessed  is  he  that  shall  eat  bread  in  the  kingdom  of  God ; 
i.e.,  in  the  resurrection  of  the  just,  of  which  Christ  had  made  mention 
in  the  preceding  verse.  & Cyril  in  the  Catena,  says,  “ This  man  was 
carnal,  for  he  thought  the  reward  of  the  saints  was  to  be  bodily.” 
He  must  therefore  have  been  one  of  the  Pharisees,  for  they  believe 
in  the  resurrection,  which  the  Sadducees  deny.  Acts  xxiii.  8.  For 
in  heaven  God  feeds,  satisfies,  and  fills  (inebriat)  the  blessed  with  all 
delights.  So  the  Psalmist : “ I shall  be  satisfied,  when  I awake,  with 
Thy  likeness.  Ps.  xviL  15.  And  again,  “They  shall  be  satisfied  with 
the  plenteousness  of  Thy  house,  and  Thou  shalt  give  them  drink  of 
Thy  pleasures  as  out  of  the  river.”  Ps.  xxxvi.  8.  This  joy  & 
Augustine  describes  at  length  in  his  Soliloquies  and  Meditations. 

Mystically \ “He  was  sighing  for  something  which  was  afar  off, 
and  the  bread  itself  was  lying  before  him.  For  who  is  that  Bread 
of  the  kingdom  of  God  but  He  who  says,  I am  the  living  bread 

which  came  down  from  heaven.”  S.  John  vi  51.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XIV. 


Yer.  1 6.  Thai  He  said  unto  him , A certain  man  made  a great 
supper.  This  parable  is  very  similar  to  that  recorded  by  S.  Matthew. 
See  commentary  on  S.  Matt  xxii.  2. 

But  you  will  ask,  What  was  this  supper?  1.  Some  understand  by 
it,  the  incarnation  of  the  Word  of  God,  the  preaching  of  His  Gospel, 
and  the  redemption  wrought  by  Him.  For  this  is  the  great  supper 
to  which  Christ,  when  He  became  incarnate,  invited  us.  S.  Matthew 
calls  it  a dinner.  It  is  a dinner  as  regards  the  Church  Militant ; 
a supper  with  respect  to  the  Church  Triumphant  In  this  sense 
Leonidas  addressed  his  comrades  before  the  battle : “ Let  us  dine, 
fellow-soldiers,  for  we  shall  sup  in  the  nether  (or  rather  the  upper) 
world.”  For  the  Church  Militant  here  on  earth  is  striving  eagerly 
to  attain  the  Church  Triumphant  in  Heaven. 

2.  S.  Cyril,  in  the  Catena , understands  the  Eucharist  by  the 
supper.  “ The  man,”  he  says,  “ is  God  the  Father,  who  has  prepared 
for  us  a great  supper  in  Christ,  for  He  has  given  us  His  own  body 
to  eat  Whence  the  Church  makes  choice  of  this  parable  for  the 
Feast  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament” 

3.  But  in  its  literal  sense,  the  supper  is  the  happiness  and  glory 
of  heaven.  It  is  called  a supper,  because  it  will  be  given  in  the 
evening,  i.e.  at  the  end  of  the  world,  when  life  and  its  troubles  are 
over : because,  also,  it  will  be  our  only  and  everlasting  refreshment. 

The  great  supper,  says  S.  Gregory  (Hon u 36),  is  the  full  enjoyment 
of  eternal  sweetness ; for  after  it  no  guest  is  cast  out. 

A great.  For  nothing  greater  than  it  can  be  imagined,  since  God 
Himself  will  be  our  food  and  feast.  Hence,  Euthymius  says,  “ Hereby 
is  signified  the  unspeakable  fruition  of  God,  who  will  fulfil  the 
utmost  expectations  of  the  blessed.  For  1 eye  hath  not  seen,  nor 
ear  heard,  neither  have  entered  into  the  heart  of  man,  the  things 
which  God  hath  prepared  for  them  that  love  Him.’  ” 1 Cor.  ii.  9. 

And  bade  many : e.g.9  the  whole  nation  of  the  Jews,  who  were 
the  Church  and  the  chosen  people  of  God,  and  specially  their  rulers, 
who  were  bidden  to  “ repent,  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is  at  hand.” 
S.  Matt  iil  2.

the  resurrection  to  say  that  all  things  were  ready  for  the  heavenlj 
feast 

Ver.  18. — And  they  all  with  one  consent  began  to  make  excuse. 
The  first  said  unto  him,  I have  bought  a piece  of  ground,  &c.  The 
Scribes  and  Pharisees,  and  the  chief  Priests  are  here  clearly  indi- 
cated ; for  they,  invited  by  Christ  to  the  Gospel  feast,  made  light 
of  it,  because  they  were  so  intent  on  their  farms,  i.e.  their  worldly 
possessions,  that  they  had  neither  time  nor  inclination  to  think 
about  the  salvation  of  their  souls.  “ God,”  says  S.  Gregory  (Horn. 
36  in  Evang.),  " offers  what  ought  to  have  been  asked.  Unasked, 
He  is  ready  to  give,  what  we  could  scarcely  dare  hope  for.  He 
announces  that  the  delights  of  the  eternal  feast  are  ready,  and  with 
one  consent  they  make  excuse.”  “ They  say,  I pray  thee,  and  then 
disdain  to  come.  The  word  sounds  of  humility,  but  the  action  is 
pride.”  S.  Bernard  rightly  calls  men  who  seek  wealth,  pleasure, 
honour  and  the  like,  lunatics.  “ I once  ” says  he,  “ saw  five  men : 
why  should  I not  look  on  them  as  lunatics?  For  the  first,  with 
swollen  cheeks,  was  chewing  the  sand  of  the  sea  shore.  The  second, 
standing  by  a lake  of  sulphur,  was  endeavouring  to  inhale  the  foul 
and  noxious  vapour  which  arose  therefrom.  The  third,  leaning  over 
a blazing  furnace,  was  enjoying  the  burning  sparks  which  he  received 
within  his  gaping  jaws.  The  fourth,  seated  on  a pinnacle  of  a 
temple,  was  drawing  in  with  open  mouth  the  light  breezes,  and  if 
they  seemed  to  flow  less  freely  he  fanned  himself,  as  if  in  hope  of 
inhaling  the  whole  atmosphere.  The  fifth,  standing  aside,  was 
laughing  at  the  others,  although  himself  the  most  deserving  of 
ridicule,  for  he  was  busily  engaged  in  sucking  his  own  flesh,  apply- 
ing now  his  hands,  now  his  arms,  now  one  part  of  his  body,  now 
another  to  his  mouth.”  By  these  figures  S.  Bernard  pictures  the 
various  kinds  of  sin.  The  first  represents  the  greedy,  the  second 
the  lustful,  the  third  those  prone  to  anger,  the  fourth  the  ambitious, 
and  the  fifth  those  who  boast  themselves  over  much  of  their  pos- 
sessions and  are  self-satisfied,  who  are  never  content,  but  ever 
thirsting  for  the  good  things  of  this  world.

go  to  prove  thorn , &c  Another  kind  of  avarice  is  here  described,  viz , 
the  desire  of  possessing  oxen,  and  animals  for  tillage,  or  food,  or  some 
other  purpose ; for  the  riches  of  the  patriarchs  lay  in  their  herds.  So 
think  Theophylact  and  Titus.  S.  Gregory,  however  {Horn.  36),  says, 
“ What  are  we  to  understand  by  the  five  yoke  of  oxen  but  the  five 
senses  ? which  are  rightly  called  yokes,  because  they  are  double  in 
the  two  sexes.” 

Ver.  2a — And  another  said , I have  married  a wife , &c.  What, 
asks  S.  Gregory,  are  we  to  understand  by  a wife  but  carnal  gratifica- 
tions ? The  Pharisees,  like  many  at  the  present  time,  were  ensnared 
by  avarice  and  luxury.  These  are  the  thorns  which  choke  the  word 
of  God.  S.  Luke  viil  14. 

Let  us  all  then  give  heed  to  the  warning  of  S.  Paul,  and  remember 
that  “the  fashion  of  this  world  passeth  away”  (1  Cor  vil  31).  “For  the 
‘res  temporalis 9 consists  in  possession,  and  ‘ res  etema * in  expecta- 
tion,” S.  Gregory  (Horn.  36).  Not  that  marriage  is  censured  here  (save 
so  far  as  it  interferes  with  the  work  of  salvation),  says  S.  Ambrose, 
but  purity  is  held  up  to  greater  honour,  for  “ the  love  of  the  things  of 
this  world  is  a fetter  to  (viscus  est)  the  wings  of  the  spirit”  Gloss. 

In  carnal  things,  desire  begets  satiety,  and  satiety  disgust ; but  in 
spiritual  things,  satiety  provokes  desire.  S.  Gregory. 

S.  Augustine  (serm.  33,  De  Verb.  Domini)  explains  and  applies 
somewhat  differently  the  excuses  of  the  invited  guests : 

“The  piece  of  ground  which  was  bought  denotes  government 
Therefore  pride  is  the  first  vice  reproved. 

“The  five  yoke  of  oxen  are  taken  to  be  the  five  senses,  by  means 
of  which  earthly  things  are  pursued.  For  the  oxen  till  the  ground ; 
but  men  at  a distance  from  faith,  given  up  to  earthly  things,  are  occu- 
pied with  carnal  matters. 

“ * Love  not  the  world,  therefore,  neither  the  things  that  are  in  the 
world/  for  ‘the  world  passeth  away,  and  the  lust  thereof/  1 S.  John 
ii.  15,  17.  Away  then  with  wicked  and  vain  excuses,  and  let  us 
come  to  the  supper  wherewith  we  may  be  inwardly  nourished.  Let 
not  the  lifting  up  of  pride  hinder  us,  neither  let  lawless  curiosity 
fright  us,  and  turn  us  away  from  God.  Let  not  the  pleasures  of  the

flesh  keep  us  from  the  pleasure  of  the  heart  Let  us  come  and  be 
filled.” 

Ver.  21. — So  that  servant  came,  ami  shewed  his  lord  these  things, 
&c.  We  are  here  taught  that  Christ  chose  the  outcasts  and  poor 
in  place  of  the  Priests  and  Pharisees  who  had  made  light  of  His 
gospeL  According  to  that  which  is  written,  “ The  publicans  and 
harlots  go  into  the  kingdom  of  God  before  you.”  S.  Matt  xxi.  31. 
And  again,  “ Many  that  are  first  shall  be  last : and  the  last  shall 
be  first”  S.  Matt  xix.  30. 

For  albeit  that  Christ  preached  from  the  commencement  of  His 
ministry  both  to  the  Pharisees  and  to  the  multitude,  yet  the 
Pharisees,  as  of  higher  rank,  were  the  first  invited  \ to  preserve 
the  unity  of  the  parable;  and  also  because  Christ  would  have 
the  scribes  first,  by  reason  of  their  position,  acknowledge  Him, 
and  then  be  His  witnesses  amongst  the  people.  But  the  con* 
trary  came  to  pass.  “They,”  says  Euthymius,  “who  refused  to 
acknowledge  Him,  were  the  chief  Priests  and  rulers  of  the  people, 
and  these,  who  were  chosen  in  their  stead,  were  the  humble  and  the 
outcasts  of  the  nation.”  For  of  a truth  “ God  hath  chosen  the  weak 
things  of  the  world  to  confound  the  things  which  are  mighty.” 
1 Cor.  i.  27. 

Symbolically.  S.  Augustine  says  (serin.  34  De  Verb.  Dom.) : Who 
were  those  that  came,  but  the  poor,  and  the  maimed,  and  the  halt, 
and  the  blind  ? Those  who  absented  themselves  were  those  who 
thought  themselves  rich,  and  robust ; who,  as  it  were,  could  walk 
well,  and  see  clearly,  the  hopelessness  of  whose  state  was  propor- 
tionate to  their  pride. 

Let  the  beggars  come  to  the  feast  at  the  invitation  of  Him  who 
made  Himself  poor  that  we  might  become  rich. 

Let  the  weak  come,  for  the  physician  has  no  need  of  those  that 
are  whole,  but  of  those  that  are  sick. 

Let  the  lame  come  and  say,  “Order  my  steps  in  Thy  word.” 

Let  the  blind  come  and  say,  “ Lighten  Thou  mine  eyes,  that  I sleep 
not  in  death.” 

These  poor  and  miserable  creatures  teach  us :

$58  S.  LUKE,  c.  XlV. 

1.  That  none  are  to  be  despised,  but  that  salvation  in  Christ  is  to 
be  offered  to  all 

2.  That  it  is  easier  for  the  poor  to  obey  the  gospel  precepts,  and 
therefore  to  be  saved,  than  for  the  rich. 

3.  That  we  must  despair  of  no  one's  salvation,  however  wretched, 
blind,  or  perverse  he  may  be. 

Ver.  22. — And  the  servant  said \ Yet  there  is  room.  The  number  of 
the  elect  is  not  yet  complete.  Heaven  is  not  yet  filled  with  those 
who  are  to  obtain  salvation.  Learn  to  imitate  the  zeal  of  this  ser- 
vant, who  rejected  no  one,  however  blind,  deformed,  or  maimed,  but 
busied  himself  in  summoning  and  saving  more  and  more. 

Ver.  23. — And  the  lord  said  unto  the  servant \ Go  out  into  the  high- 
ways and  hedges , &c.  Go  forth,  without  the  city — without  Jerusalem, 
and  beyond  Judaea,  and  call  the  Gentiles  to  Christ. 

Into  the  highways.  “The  partings  of  the  highways”  (S.  Matt 
xxii.  9),  i.e.  into  the  roads  which  lead  to  all  nations  and  to  the 
ends  of  the  earth. 

And  hedges.  The  hamlets  and  villages,  which  were  surrounded  not 
by  walls  but  by  hedges.  Hence  we  are  taught  that  the  Gospel  is 
to  be  preached  by  the  Apostles  and  their  successors,  even  to  savage 
and  uncivilised  nations ; a duty  which  is  recognised  more  and  more 
by  the  followers  of  Christ. 

Hence  the  servant  does  not  say,  as  he  added  of  the  Jews  in  the 
22nd  verse,  “it  is  done  as  thou  hast  commanded;”  because  the 
work  is  not  yet  finished  among  the  Gentiles ; it  is  being  done  more 
fully  from  day  to  day,  to  be  completed  at  the  end  of  the  world. 
“The  meaning  of  this  verse,”  says  Titus,  “ is,  that  after  the  Israelites 
had  been  gathered  in,  the  people  of  the  Gentiles  were  also  to  be 
called,  i.e.  men  who,  as  being  bom  and  brought  up  in  the  country,  in 
the  highways  and  hedges  without  the  city,  were  entirely  uncivilised.” 
Or,  as  Theophylact  interprets  it,  “The  Israelites  were  within  the 
city,  having  received  the  law,  and  having  been  granted  a more 
civilised  lot  in  life ; but  the  Gentiles  were  aliens  from  the  common- 
wealth of  Israel,  strangers  from  the  covenants  of  promise,  and 
without  God  in  the  world.”  (Epk  ii.  12.)

WAIFS  COMPELLED  TO  COME  IN. 


359 


Compel  them  to  come  in.  Many  of  the  Gentile  nations  were  wholly 
given  up  to  idolatry  and  evil  living.  Hence  they  were  to  be  com- 
pelled to  salvation  by  the  burning  zeal  and  energy  of  the  preacher, 
by  miracles,  even  by  the  scourge  and  judgments  of  God  sent  upon 
them  “in  demonstration  of  the  Spirit  and  of  power”  (i  Cor.  il  4). 
For  “ our  gospel  came  not  unto  you  in  word  only,  but  also  in  power, 
and  in  the  Holy  Ghost,  and  in  much  assurance.”  1 Thess.  L 5. 

“ Therefore,”  says  Suarez,  “compel  them  to  come  in,  either  by 
afflicting  them  with  labour  and  sorrows,  or  by  converting  them,  as  it 
were,  miraculously,  by  a mighty  effort  and  powerful  call.” 

Ver.  24. — For  I say  unto  you , that  none  of  those  men  which  were 
bidden  shall  taste  of  my  supper , because  they  made  light  of  my  invita- 
tion. So  the  Pharisees  and  the  rulers  of  the  Jews,  given  up  to 
earthly  enjoyments,  are  to  be  excluded  from  the  heavenly  feast 
because,  called  by  Christ  to  accept  the  teaching  of  His  gospel,  they 
refused  the  invitation.  “ Because  I have  called  and  ye  refused,  I 
also  will  laugh  at  your  calamity ; I will  mock  when  your  fear  cometh.” 
Prov.  i.  24.  Then  shall  they,  too  late,  repent  of  their  ingratitude 
and  folly,  and  shall  say,  “What  hath  pride  profited  us,  or  what 
good  hath  riches  with  our  vaunting  brought  us  ? For  those  things 
are  passed  away  like  a shadow.”  Wisdom  v.  8. 

So  far  Christ  had  said  all  these  things  in  the  house  of  the  Pharisee, 
whose  invitation  He  had  accepted,  in  order  that  He  might  instruct 
him  and  his  friends.  Let  all  those,  therefore,  who  are  followers  of 
Christ,  imitate  His  example,  and  not  take  part  in  any  entertainment 
unless  it  be  for  the  purpose  of  reaping  spiritual  fruit 
Ver.  26. — If  any  man  come  to  Me,  &c.  That  having  left  all  (ver. 
33)  he  may,  with  the  Apostles  and  the  seventy  disciples,  follow  Me, 
the  Master  and  Teacher  of  perfection. 

All  these  things  are  of  evangelical  counsel,  and  not  of  precept ; 
although  they  may  be  said  in  a measure  to  extend  to  all  Christians, 
inasmuch  as  they  are  bound  to  hate  their  parents,  i.e.  to  give  up 
the  love  of  their  friends  and  relations — even  the  love  of  life,  if  such 
love  oppose  itself  to  the  law  of  Christ.  Hence  Maldonatus  thinks 
this  to  be  of  precept ; Jansenius,  of  counsel.  But  see  S.  Matt.  x.  37.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XIV. 


Suarez  (lib.  ii.  De  Concurs.  JDom.)  says,  “ to  hate”  signifies  the 
same  as  “to  love  less,”  in  which  sense  it  is  written,  “Jacob  have 
I loved,  .but  Esau  have  I hated.”  Rom.  ix.  13. 

Ver.  28.  For  which  of  you,  intending  to  build  a tower,  &c.  By 
means  of  this  parable  Christ  would  teach  us  with  what  prudence 
we  ought  to  test  our  bodily,  and  above  all  our  spiritual  strength, 
as  well  as  such  gifts  of  grace  as  we  may  possess,  before  we 
attempt  to  build  the  lofty  tower  of  evangelical  perfection,  and 
declare  war  against  ourselves,  our  passions,  our  friends  and  the 
whole  world  ; lest  afterward,  recoiling  from  so  great  an  undertaking, 
we  incur  the  loss  of  all  our  outlay,  and  also  the  reproach  of  having 
rashly  commenced  a building  which  we  were  unable  to  finish,  and 
of  having  entered  upon  a war  in  which  we  were  worsted. 

“ He  counts  the  cost,”  says  the  Gloss,  “who  perceives  that  money 
will  have  to  be  spent,  i.e . that  the  heart  must  be  weaned  from  corrupt 
desires,  and  the  soul  prepared  for  adversity.” 

Symbolically.  Salmeron  (tom,  vii.  tract  24)  says,  “Christ  puts 
forth  two  parables  to  teach  the  rulers  of  the  Church  that  they  must 
be  skilled  both  in  action  and  in  contemplation,  the  one  about  build- 
ing a tower,  which  is  a symbol  of  contemplative  life,  for  a tower  com- 
mands an  extensive  prospect;  the  other,  about  engaging  in  war 
against  a hostile  king,  which  is  significative  of  the  active  life. 

“ For  those  who  are  novices  in  the  way  of  God,  and  are  learning, 
as  it  were,  the  first  elements  of  the  perfect  life,  are  called  upon  to 
battle  with  their  enemies,  and  to  fight  against  their  vices  and  evil 
passions. 

“ By  the  tower  therefore  we  may  understand  the  religious  state, 
which  is  coupled  to  the  comtemplative  life. 

“ 1.  Because  as  a tower  overtops  all  other  buildings,  so  does  a 
life  of  religion  excel  all  other  vocations  and  callings. 

“ 2.  As  a tower  gives  grace  to  a city,  so  is  the  religious  life  an 
ornament  to  the  Church. 

“3.  As  a tower  is  a look-out,  to  discover  the  movements  of  the 
enemy,  so  in  the  contemplative  life  we  look  forth  on  the  wiles  of  oui 
adversary,  and  on  the  good  and  evil  laid  up  in  futurity.

THE  RELIGIOUS  LIFE. 


36l 


u 4.  As  a tower  is  a protection  to  them  that  dwell  therein,  so  is  a 
life  of  religion  a defence  against  the  world,  the  flesh  and  the  devil, 
and  a safe  storehouse  for  the  fruits  of  good  works.  So  it  is  written, 
Cant  iv.  4,  * Thy  neck  is  like  the  tower  of  David,  . . . whereon 
hang  a thousand  bucklers/  ue.  the  bucklers  of  holy  vows,  holy 
examples,  and  holy  observances. 

“ 5.  As  every  one  ought  to  count  the  cost  before  he  commences  to 
build  a tower,  so  a year  is  given  a novice  in  order  that  he  may  make 
trial  of  his  fitness  for  the  religious  life.  For  he  whose  heart  is  fixed 
on  heaven  looks  down  as  from  a lofty  tower  upon  the  world  which 
lies  beneath,  and  counts  it  worthless.’1 

So  S.  Chrysostom  (hom.  15  ad.  Fop.),  says : “Just  as  to  those 

who  look  back  from  the  highest  mountain  tops,  not  only  men  and 
trees  but  even  entire  cities  look  small,  and  great  armies  seem  to  be 
creeping  about  like  ants,  so  to  those  whose  minds  are  uplifted  by 
the  constant  contemplation  of  heavenly  things,  all  human  affairs, 
power,  glory,  riches,  and  the  like,  seem  minute  and  worthless : 
unworthy  of  the  greatness  of  the  immortal  soul.” 

Hear  also  the  lament  of  S.  Gregory,  when  he  was  called  from  a 
religious  order  to  be  the  Pope  : “ Seeking  nothing,  in  this  world,  and 
fearing  nothing,  I seemed  to  stand  on  a certain  eminence,  so  that 
I thought  that  the  promise  of  God,  * I will  cause  thee  to  ride  upon 
the  high  places  of  the  earth’ (Isa.  lviii.  14),  had  well-nigh  been 
fulfilled  in  me.  For  he  rides  upon  the  high  places  of  the  earth,  who 
despises  and  treads  under  feet  all  that  this  world  counts  great  and 
glorious.  But  suddenly  cast  down  from  this  eminence,  and  plunged 
into  the  whirl  of  temptation,  I have  became  a prey  to  terror  and 
affright,  for  although  I fear  nothing  for  myselfj  I fear  much  for  those 
committed  to  my  charge  ” (Lib.  1,  epist.  5 and  6). 

Ver.  31. — Or  what  king,  going  to  make  war  against  another 
king , &c.  By  this,  says  Titus,  we  are  given  to  understand  that  we 
have  a war  to  wage  against  the  hostile  powers  of  Satan  and  that  law 
which,  reigning  in  our  members,  is  continually  the  cause  of  inward 
perturbation  and  strife. 

So  also  S.  Cyril : “ The  ten  thousand  of  him  who  is  going  to  fight

with  the  king,  who  has  double  the  number,  signify  the  simplicity  of  the 
Christian  about  to  contend  with  the  subtlety  of  the  devil”  And 
Theophylact : “ The  king  is  sin,  and  devils  are  his  satellites,  who, 
compared  to  us,  are  considered  to  have  greater  strength.” 

But  S.  Gregory  {Horn.  37)  gives  another  interpretation.  “ The  king 
that  is  about  to  come  against  us  is  Christ,  who  will  come  with  a 
double  army  against  a single  one.  For  while  we  are  scarcely  pre- 
pared in  deeds  only,  He  will  discomfit  us  at  once,  both  in  thought 
and  deed.  Let  us  send  Him  therefore  an  embassy ; our  tears,  our 
works  of  mercy,  and  propitiatory  victim.” 

Ver.  32. — Or  else, , while  the  other  is  yet  a great  way  off,  &c  This 
verse  gives  completeness  to  the  parable,  but  is  not  to  be  taken  as 
the  teaching  of  Christ,  for  we  may  not  bargain  with  either  the  evil 
spirits  or  our  vices ; against  these  we  must  wage  an 

irreconcileable  war. 

This  verse  may  however  be  interpreted  in  this  way — 

“ He  that  desires  to  follow  me  perfectly  in  poverty  and  in  the  preach- 
ing of  the  gospel,  must  make  an  entire  surrender  of  self,  and  give 
up  parents,  friends,  and  possessions,  thus  making  them  enemies. 

“ But  if  he  see  that  he  has  not  strength  enough  for  this,  let  him 
make  conditions  of  peace  with  them,  and  bind  himself  by  the  gospel 
precepts  only,  leaving  for  others  the  counsels  of  poverty,  obedience, 
and  the  preaching  of  salvation.  For  this  is  that  which  Christ  would 
teach,  as  is  clear  from  the  following  verse ; hence  he  makes  mention 
of  two  armies,  two  leaders,  and  two  banners,  one  His  own,  and  the 
other  that  of  Lucifer.  Wherefore  the  Apostles  and  their  successors 
have  need  to  bear  in  mind  that  they  are  engaged  in  actual  warfare 
against  the  devil  and  his  angels.”  S.  Cyril 

Ver.  33. — So  likewise t whosoever  he  be  of  you  that  fbrsaketh  not  all 
that  he  hath , &c.  This  is  the  post-parable,  and  sums  up  the  teaching 
of  the  parable  itself.  “ He  who  refuseth  to  give  up  all,  in  order  that 
he  may  live  a life  of  evangelical  perfection,  cannot  be  My  disciple  as 
the  Apostles  were.”  And  again,  It  would  be  better  for  him  who  is 
unwilling  to  give  up  all,  when  persecution  or  necessity  demand  it, 
and  will  not  submit  to  the  loss  of  possessions,  family,  and  even  life

itself  for  the  gospel’s  sake,  not  to  take  My  yoke  upon  him,  rather 
than  having  begun  to  lead  a Christian  life,  to  fall  away  and  aposta- 
tise from  the  faith.  For  such  an  one  adds  the  sin  of  apostasy  to  that 
of  unbelief,  according  to  the  Scripture  : “ For  it  had  been  better  for 
them  not  to  have  known  the  way  of  righteousness,  than,  after  they 
have  known  it,  to  turn  from  the  holy  commandment  delivered  unto 
them.”  2 S.  Pet  ii.  21. 

Christ  here  teaches  us  that  to  become  a disciple  is  no  child’s  play, 
but  a work  for  men,  needing  great  gifts  of  grace,  and  much  strength 
of  purpose  and  much  vigour  of  mind. 

The  Christians  of  the  first  three  centuries,  particularly  those 
of  Rome,  in  time  of  persecution,  cheerfully  made  sacrifice  of  their 
fortunes,  their  liberty  and  their  lives,  for  the  gospel’s  sake.  “ Few,” 
says  Bede,  “ are  wishing  to  leave  all  and  give  up  earthly  cares ; but  it  is 
for  every  one  who  is  faithful  to  renounce  all,  ie.  so  to  hold  the  things 
that  are  of  the  world,  that  he  may  not  be  held  in  the  world.” 

Hear  also  S.  Gregory  (hom.  36)  : I “would  advise  you  to  leave  all, 
but  I dare  not.  But  if  you  are  not  able  to  give  up  all,  be  masters  of 
your  earthly  possessions ; let  them  not  gain  the  mastery  over  you.” 

Ver.  34. — Salt  is  good,  but  if  the  salt  have  lost  his  savour,  &c.  Salt 
is  good  as  long  as  it  retains  its  peculiar  properties.  So  also  ye  who 
are  my  Apostles,  as  long  as  ye  preserve  your  spiritual  powers,  will  be 
useful  to  the  world  to  season  it  with  the  salt  of  gospel  faith  and 
wisdom.  But  if  ye  lose  your  savour,  ye  will  be  good  for  nothing 
but  to  be  despised  and  trodden  under  feet  of  men,  for  there  is  no 
one  to  season  or  correct  you.  Bede.  See  also  Comment  on  S. 
Matt.  v.  13,  and  S.  Mark  ix.  50. 

This  parable  applies  not  only  to  the  Apostles,  but  in  a measure 
to  all  Christians.  For  they  ought,  by  the  innocence  of  their  lives 
and  their  good  example,  to  season  unbelievers  who  are,  as  it  were, 
unsalted. 

Ver.  35. — He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear.  Let  him  hear 
and  meditate  on  what  I say  and  teach.  Our  Lord  calls  attention  to 
the  seriousness  and  the  difficulty  of  the  matter  about  which  He  has 
been  teaching.  See  Comment  on  S.  Matt  xiii.  9-13.

CHAPTER  XV. 

I  The  parable  of  the  lost  sheep : 8 of  the  piece  of  silver : 1 1 of  the  prodigal  son* 

THEN  drew  near  unto  him  all  the  publicans  and  sinners  for  to  hear  him. 

2  And  the  Pharisees  and  scribes  murmured,  saying.  This  man  received! 
sinners,  and  eateth  with  them. 

3  IT  And  he  spake  this  parable  unto  them,  saying, 

4  What  man  of  you,  having  an  hundred  sheep,  if  he  lose  one  of  them,  doth 
not  leave  the  ninety  and  nine  in  the  wilderness,  and  go  after  that  which  is  lost, 
until  he  find  it  ? 

5  And  when  he  hath  found  it,  he  layeth  it  on  his  shoulders,  rejoicing. 

6  And  when  he  cometh  home,  he  calleth  together  his  friends  and  neighbour^ 
saying  unto  them,  Rejoice  with  me  ; for  1 have  found  my  sheep  which  was  lost 
7 1 say  unto  you,  that  likewise  joy  shall  be  in  heaven  over  one  sinner  that 
repentelb,  more  than  over  ninety  and  nine  just  persons,  which  need  no  repentance. 

8 IT  Either  what  woman  having  ten  pieces  of  silver,  if  she  lose  one  piece,  doth 
not  light  a candle,  and  sweep  the  house,  and  seek  diligently  till  she  find  it  l 
9 And  when  she  hath  found  it,  she  calleth  her  friends  and  her  neighbours 
together,  saying,  Rejoice  with  me ; for  I have  found  the  piece  which  I had  lost. 

10  Likewise,  I say  unto  you,  there  is  joy  in  the  presence  of  the  angels  of  God 
over  one  sinner  that  repenteth. 

II  IT  And  he  said,  A certain  man  had  two  sons  : 

12  And  the  younger  of  them  said  to  his  father.  Father,  give  me  the  portion  of 
goods  that  falleth  to  me.  And  he  divided  unto  them  his  living. 

13  And  not  many  days  after  the  younger  son  gathered  all  together,  and  took 
his  journey  into  a far  country,  and  there  wasted  his  substance  with  riotous  living. 

14  And  when  he  had  spent  all,  there  arose  a mighty  famine  in  that  land  ; and 
he  began  to  be  in  want. 

15  And  he  went  and  joined  himself  to  a citizen  of  that  country ; and  he  sent 
him  into  his  fields  to  feed  swine. 

16  And  he  would  fain  have  filled  his  belly  with  the  husks  that  the  swine  did 
eat : and  no  man  gave  unto  him. 

17  And  when  he  came  to  himself  he  said,  How  many  hired  servants  of  my 
father's  have  bread  enough  and  to  spare,  and  I perish  with  hunger  1 
18  I will  arise  and  go  to  my  father,  and  will  say  unto  him,  Father,  I have 
sinned  against  heaven,  and  before  thee, 

19  And  am  no  more  worthy  to  be  called  thy  son:  make  me  as  one  of  thy 
hired  servants. 

20  And  he  arose,  and  came  to  his  father.  But  when  he  was  yet  a great  way

off,  his  father  saw  him,  and  had  compassion,  and  ran,  and  fell  on  his  neck,  and 
kissed  him. 

21  And  the  son  said  unto  him.  Father,  I have  sinned  against  heaven,  and  in 
thy  sight,  and  am  no  more  worthy  to  be  called  thy  son. 

22  But  the  father  said  to  his  servants,  Bring  forth  the  best  robe,  and  put  it  on 
him  ; and  put  a ring  on  his  hand,  and  shoes  on  his  feet : 

23  And  bring  hither  the  fatted  calf,  and  kill  it ; and  let  us  eat,  and  be  merry : 

24  For  this  my  son  was  dead,  and  is  alive  again ; he  was  lost,  and  is  found. 
And  they  began  to  be  merry. 

25  Now  his  efder  son  was  in  the  held  : and  as  he  came  and  drew  nigh  to  the 
house,  he  heard  musick  and  dancing. 

26  And  he  called  one  of  the  servants,  and  asked  what  these  things  meant. 

27  And  he  said  unto  him,  Thy  brother  is  come  ; and  thy  father  hath  killed  the 
fatted  calf,  because  he  hath  received  him  safe  and  sound. 

28  And  he  was  angry,  and  would  not  go  in  : therefore  came  his  father  out,  and 
intreated  him. 

29  And  he  answering  said  to  his  father,  Lo,  these  many  years  do  I serve  thee, 
neither  transgressed  I at  any  time  thy  commandment : and  yet  thou  never  gavest 
me  a kid,  that  I might  make  merry  with  my  friends  : 

30  But  as  soon  as  this  thy  son  was  come,  which  hath  devoured  thy  living  with 
harlot?,  thou  hast  killed  for  him  the  fatted  calf. 

31  And  he  said  unto  him,  Son,  thou  art  ever  with  me,  and  all  that  I have  is 
thine. 

32  It  was  meet  that  we  should  make  merry,  and  be  glad  : for  this  thy  brother 
was  dead,  and  is  alive  again  ; and  was  lost,  and  is  found. 

Ver.  i. — Then  drew  near  unto  Him  all  the  publicans  and  sinners . 
Tdtnc,  all,  that  is,  many  came  together  to  hear  Christ,  attracted  by  His 
sanctity  and  by  the  loving-kindness  with  which  He  called  sinners 
to  Himself,  and  promised  pardon  and  salvation  to  the  penitent 
For  His  preaching  was,  “ Repent,  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is  at 
hand.”  & Matt.  iv.  17. 

Ver.  2. — And  the  Pharisees  and  Scribes  murmured . For  as  they 
avoided  the  touch  of  unclean  bodies,  so  did  they  avoid  that  of  sinful 
souls.  Hence  they  did  not  deign  to  speak  to  sinners,  much  less  to 
eat  with  them.  This  constituted  the  proud  spirit  of  the  Pharisees, 
who  thought  themselves  pure  and  holy  in  all  things  pertaining  to 
the  law,  and  therefore  kept  apart  from  the  impure  that  they  might 
not  be  defiled.  To  them  the  spirit  of  Christ  was  clearly  opposed ; 
for  He  came  into  the  world  to  save  sinners,  and  therefore  sought 
opportunity  to  converse  with  them,  and  when  invited  was  present 
at  their  feasts ; for  nothing  is  more  pleasing  to  God  than  the  con*

version  of  the  sinner.  “From  which  we  may  gather,”  says  & 
Gregory  {horn.  34),  “that  true  justice,  i.e.  the  justice  of  Christ,  is 
full  of  compassion,  but  that  the  false  justice  of  the  Pharisees  is 
scornful.”  “ Indeed,  it  is,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ the  mark  of  the 
apostolic  life,  to  think  for  the  salvation  of  souls.” 

Ver.  4. — What  man  of  you,  having  an  hundred  sheep , if  he  lose  one 
of  them , doth  not  leave  the  ninety  and  nine  in  the  wilderness , and  go 
after  that  which  is  lost , until  he  find  iff  For  a sheep  is  a simple 
and  foolish  animal,  which,  in  search  of  pasture,  easily  loses  its  way 
and  wanders  from  the  fold,  and  when  once  astray  is  unable  to  return. 
So  that  there  is  need  of  a shepherd  to  go  forth  and  seek  it 

So  we,  by  reason  of  our  sinful  lusts,  were  as  wandering  sheep, 
treading  the  path  which  led  to  perdition,  without  a thought  of  God 
or  of  heaven,  or  of  the  salvation  of  our  souls.  Wherefore  Christ 
came  down  from  heaven  to  seek  us,  and  to  lead  us  back  from  the 
way  of  destruction  to  that  which  leadeth  to  eternal  life.  So  we  read, 
“All  we  like  sheep  have  gone  astray;  we  have  turned  every  one 
to  his  own  way ; and  the  Lord  hath  laid  on  Him  the  iniquity  of  us 
all,”  Isa.  liii.  6 ; and  again,  “Ye  were  as  sheep  going  astray ; but 
are  now  returned  unto  the  Shepherd  and  Bishop  of  your  souls.” 
1 S.  Pet  ii.  25. 

Ver.  5. — And  when  he  hath  found  it , he  layeth  it  on  his  shoulders , 
rejoicing.  Or  as  the  Arabic  renders  it,  “ He  carries  it  on  his  shoulders 
joyfully,”  that  he  may  the  more  quickly  return  it  to  the  flock. 

In  like  manner  on  Christ  “ was  laid,”  as  saith  the  prophet  Isaiah, 
“ the  iniquity  of  us  all”  Hence  Gregory  of  Nyssa,  writes  in  the 
Catena , “ When  the  shepherd  had  found  the  sheep,  he  did  not  punish 
it,  he  did  not  drive  it  to  the  fold,  but  placing  it  on  his  shoulder,  and 
carrying  it  gently,  he  reunited  it  with  the  flock.”  Oh  how  wondrous 
is  the  meekness,  clemency,  and  love  of  Christ  our  Lord  ! It  was  to 
represent  this  love  to  the  faithful  that  Christ  is  depicted  in  our 
temples  with  the  lost  sheep  on  His  shoulders,  carrying  it  back  to 
the  flock,  and  it  is  related  of  the  son  of  Charlemagne,  that  laying 
aside  his  royal  state,  he  became  a monk,  and  when  employed  in 
keeping  sheep,  followed  to  the  letter  the  example  set  by  the  Good

PARABLE  OF  THE  LOST  SHEEP.  367 

Shepherd  : for  humility  and  the  imitation  of  Christ  is  in  truth  the 
glory  of  Christian  kings. 

Ver.  6. — Rejoice  with  me;  for  I have  found  my  sheep  which  was 
lost  '2\tyya&T • (***>  Let  My  joy  be  one  with  yours — partake  of  My  joy. 
His  joy  is  so  great  that  he  cannot  confine  it  to  Himself,  His  friends 
must  rejoice  also.  He  further  indicates  that  the  event  is  such  a 
happy  one,  that  it  ought  to  afford  matter  for  rejoicing  to  all.  He 
says  not,  “ Rejoice  with  the  sheep  that  is  found,”  but,  “ with  Me.” 
Because  truly  our  life  is  His  joy.  S.  Gregory. 

Ver.  7. — I say  unto  you^  that  likewise  joy  shall  be  in  heaven , &c., 
i.e.  greater  joy,  for  such  is  implied  by  the  comparative  particle  i), 
“than.” 

The  angels  then,  and  the  saints  in  heaven,  rejoice  with  exceeding 
great  joy  when  it  is  made  known  to  them,  by  the  revelation  of  God, 
that  a sinner  is  converted;  for  when  such  an  one  by  repentance 
passes  from  condemnation  to  life,  it  is  a gain  to  the  sinner — to  the 
angels — and  above  all  to  God  Himself. 

The  sinner  passes  from  sin  unto  righteousness,  from  hell  to  heaven. 
The  angels  therefore  rejoice  at  the  blessedness  of  such  an  one, 
because,  says  Euthymius,  they  are  kindly  disposed  towards  men  and 
because  by  repentance  men  become  like  them  in  purity  and  in 
holiness.  They  rejoice  also  on  their  own  account  because  the  ruin 
which  was  effected  by  Lucifer  and  his  angels  is  remedied  by  the 
justification  and  sanctification  of  men,  and  because  the  places  from 
which  these  angels  fell  are  restored  and  filled  up.  It  is  a joy  to 
God  because  He  is  a l°ver  of  souls,  and  thirsts  for  the 

salvation  of  mea 

Again  the  angels  rejoice  that  the  desire  of  God,  whom  they  love 
above  all  things,  is  fulfilled,  and  that  He  is  a partaker  of  this  joy, 
as  well  as  honoured  by  the  penitence  of  the  sinner.  Apposite  to 
this  matter  is  the  vision  of  Carpus,  to  whom  Christ  made  known 
that  He  so  longed  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  as  to  be  ready  again 
to  suffer  death  upon  the  Cross,  if  thereby  this  object  could  be 
effected.  And  Palladius  relates  that  a certain  Anchorite,  who  had 
fallen  into  sin,  repented  in  sackcloth  and  ashes  with  many  tears;

S.  LUKE,  c.  XV. 


whereupon  an  angel  appeared  to  him  and  said,  “The  Lord  hath 
accepted  thy  penitence,  and  hath  had  compassion  on  thee.  Take 
heed  that  thou  art  not  again  led  astray.’* 

By  this  argument,  Christ  rebukes  the  Pharisees  for  murmuring 
against  Him  because  He  companied  with  sinners  in  order  to  convert 
them.  For  the  conversion  of  sinners  is  a work  most  pleasing  to 
God  and  His  angels.  The  Pharisees  ought  therefore  to  take  part  in 
this  work,  and  to  share  in  the  rejoicing.  For  “all  the  fruit”  of  the 
Incarnation,  and  of  the  death  of  Christ  upon  the  Cross  is  “to  take 
away  sin,”  Isa.  xxvii.  9, — “to  bring  in  everlasting  righteousness,” 
and  to  extend  the  kingdom  of  God.  S.  Matt  vi.  10.  The  know- 
ledge of  this  ought  to  excite  in  every  follower  of  Christ  a zealous  love 
for  the  souls  of  men. 

Hence  S.  Gregory,  when  he  heard  that  the  English  had  been  con- 
verted by  the  preaching  of  Augustine,  rejoiced  ih  spirit,  and  wrote ; 
“ If  there  is  great  joy  in  heaven  over  one  sinner  that  repenteth,  what 
joy,  think  you,  has  there  been  over  the  conversion  of  so  great  a 
people ; for  by  their  repentance  and  faith  they  have  condemned  the 
sins  which  they  aforetime  had  committed.  Whilst  heaven  is  thus 
rejoicing,  let  us  repeat  the  angelic  strain,  and  let  us  all  with  one 
accord  exclaim,  ‘ Glory  to  God  in  the  highest,  and  on  earth  peace, 
goodwill  towards  men.’” 

More  than  over  ninety  and  nine  just  persons . God  and  His  holy 
angels,  then,  rejoice  over  one  penitent  more  than  over  one  righteous 
man,  nay,  more  than  over  ninety  and  nine  just  persons ; because 
from  the  conversion  of  the  sinner  there  arises  a new  joy,  which 
seems  more  perceptible,  and  is  in  reality  felt  more  than  that  con- 
tinuous and  long-standing  joy  which  attaches  itself  to  the  ninety  and 
nine ; a joy  which,  although  actually  the  greater,  seems  to  men  to 
lose  its  freshness  by  reason  of  its  long  duration.  For  the  novelty  of 
a thing  which  we  long  for  awakens  in  us  a vast  and  a new  joy,  which 
is  felt  all  the  more  on  account  of  its  novelty,  as  we  find  when  we 
receive  tidings  of  victories  or  conversions ; and  Christ  often  speaks 
after  the  manner  of  men,  especially  in  His  parables.  The  saying  of 
S.  Bernard,  that  “ The  tears  of  penitents  are  the  wine  of  the  angels,”

JOY  OVER  ONE  SINNER  THAT  REPENTETH.  369 


applies  here : — The  joy  over  the  conversion  of  a sinner,  writes 
Emmanuel  Sk.,  is  sensibly  greater.  Although  in  other  respects,  a 
man  undoubtedly  rejoices  more  over  ninety-nine  sheep  than  over 
one,  and  God  joys  more  over  ninety  and  nine  just  persons  than 
over  one  sinner  that  repenteth. 

S.  Gregory  adds  that  God  and  His  angels  rejoice  the  more,  because 
penitents  are  wont  to  be  more  fervent  in  their  love  than  those  who 
have  not  fallen  away.  And  elsewhere  he  says,  “ The  life  of  fervent 
devotion  which  follows  after  sins  committed  is  often  more  pleasing 
to  God  than  that  innocence  which  grows  sluggish  in  its  security.” 
“ Just  as  the  leader  in  battle  loves  that  soldier  more  who,  having 
turned  from  flight,  bravely  pursues  the  enemy,  than  he  who  never 
turned  his  back  and  never  did  a brave  act.”  “ And  as  again  the 
husbandman  loves  that  land  more  which,  after  bearing  thorns,  yields 
abundant  fruit,  than  that  which  never  had  thorns,  and  never  gave 
him  a plentiful  crop.”  Finally  (Horn.  34),  he  cites  the  example  of 
Victorinus  who,  having  fallen  into  carnal  sin,  entered  a monastery, 
and  there  subjected  himself  to  the  severest  penance,  and  so  merited 
to  be  transfused  with  the  light  of  heaven,  and  to  hear  the  voice  of 
God,  “ Thy  sin  is  forgiven  thee  ! ” 

If  therefore  penance  be  of  such  avail  in  a sinner,  how  great,  infers 
S.  Gregory,  must  be  its  power  in  a just  man  ! For  many,  he  says, 
are  conscious  of  no  evil,  yet  subject  themselves  to  austerities  as 
extreme  as  if  they  were  beset  by  every  kind  of  sin.  They  eschew 
all  things,  even  such  as  are  lawful,  they  gird  themselves  about  with 
a lofty  disdain  of  earth  and  earthly  things,  they  consider  every 
pleasure  forbidden,  they  deprive  themselves  of  such  good  things  as 
are  allowed  them,  things  that  are  seen  they  despise,  they  yearn  for 
the  things  which  are  invisible,  they  rejoice  in  mourning,  in  all  things 
they  humble  themselves,  and  deplore  sins  of  thought,  as  many  mourn 
over  sins  actually  committed. 

Ver.  8. — Either  what  woman  having  ten  pieces  of  silver,  &c 
“Sweep,”  or  as  the  Arabic  renders  it,  “cleanse;”  not  “overturn,”  as 
some  read  with  S.  Gregory. 

The  “ piece  of  silver,”  or  drachma,  was  a coin  weighing  the  eighth

part  of  an  ounce.  Hence  S.  Cyril  explains,  that  by  the  parable  of 
the  lost  sheep  we  are  to  understand,  mystically,  that  we  are  the 
creatures  of  God  who  made  us,  and  the  sheep  of  His  pasture,  but 
that  by  this  second  parable  we  are  taught  that  we  were  created  in 
the  image  and  likeness  of  God,  just  as  the  coin  bears  the  image  of 
the  king. 

S.  Gregory  (Horn.  34),  very  fully  explains  the  parable,  and  applies 
it  in  the  following  manner : “ He  who  is  signified  by  the  shepherd, 
is  signified  also  by  the  woman.  For  it  is  God  Himself— God  and 
the  wisdom  of  God.  And  because  there  is  an  image  impressed  on 
the  piece,  the  woman  lost  the  piece  of  silver  when  man,  who 
was  created  after  the  image  of  God,  by  sinning  fell  away  from  the 
likeness  of  his  Creator.  The  woman  lighted  a candle,  because  the 
wisdom  of  God  appeared  in  man.  For  the  candle  is  a light  in  an 
earthen  vessel,  but  the  light  in  an  earthen  vessel  is  the  Godhead  in 
the  flesh,  and  when  the  candle  was  lit  she  overturned  (everdt)  the 
house.  Because  as  soon  as  His  divinity  shone  forth  through  the 
flesh,  all  our  consciences  were  appalled.  But  the  word  4 overturn  * 
differs  not  from  the  4 cleanse 9 or  ‘sweep*  of  the  other  MSS. 
Because  the  corrupt  mind,  if  it  be  not  first  overthrown  through  fear 
is  not  cleansed  from  its  habitual  faults.  But  when  the  house  is 
overturned  the  piece  of  silver  is  found,  for  when  the  conscience  of 
man  is  disturbed,  the  likeness  of  the  Creator  is  restored  in  him.” 
And  again,  44  Who  are  the  friends  and  neighbours  but  those  heavenly 
powers  afore  mentioned,  who  are  near  to  the  Divine  Wisdom,  inas- 
much as  they  approach  Him  through  the  grace  of  continual  vision  ? * 
Hence  in  conclusion  he  says,  “ The  woman  had  ten  pieces  of  silver, 
because  there  are  nine  orders  of  angels,  but,  that  the  number  of  the 
elect  might  be  filled  up,  man,  the  tenth,  was  created,  who  even  after 
his  sin  did  not  fall  utterly  away  from  his  Maker,  because  the  eternal 
Wisdom,  shinning  through  the  flesh  by  His  miracles,  restored  him 
by  the  light  of  the  earthen  vessel” 

Or,  as  Theophylact  interprets  it,  44  The  friends  are  all  the  heavenly 
powers ; but  the  neighbours,  the  thrones — cherubim s and  seraphims 
— which  are  most  nigh  unto  God.”

PARABLE  OF  THE  PRODIGAL  SON.  371 

Lastly,  S.  Gregory  Nyssen,  says,  “ The  ten  pieces  of  silver  are  so 
many  virtues,  of  which  we  ought  to  lack  none,  for  like  the  command- 
ments they  are  complete  in  themselves  (decern).  The  candle  is  the 
divine  word  or  perhaps  the  torch  of  repentance ; the  neighbours, 
reason,  desire,  anger,  and  such  like  affections.” 

Ver.  1 1 . — And  He  said , A certain  man  had  two  sons.  This  parable 
is  the  third  of  the  series,  and  like  the  two  preceding  ones,  is 
designed  to  show  the  joy  which  is  in  heaven  over  the  conversion  of 
a sinner.  And  so  there  are  three  principal  persons  in  the  parable, 
the  father  and  his  two  sons,  the  elder  careful  of  his  possessions,  the 
younger  a spendthrift  The  father  is  God,  who  created  all  men,  or 
Christ,  who  redeemed  and  regenerated  all  men  with  His  blood,  and 
who  daily  regenerates  them  by  baptism.  The  two  sons  are  under- 
stood by  universal  consent  to  represent  the  Jews  and  the  Gentiles. 
By  the  elder,  who  was  ever  with  his  father,  we  may  understand  the 
Jews ; by  the  younger  the  Gentiles,  who  having  worshipped  God  in 
the  days  of  Adam  and  Noah,  turned  aside  to  idols  and  the  sins  of 
the  flesh : an  interpretation  which  is  borne  out  by  the  25th  verse, 
for  it  was  the  Jews  who  murmured  because  the  Gentiles  were  received 
into  grace  and  favour  by  Christ 

But  still  more  in  accordance  with  the  purpose  of  the  parable,  we 
may  take  the  two  sons  to  represent  the  just  and  the  unjust,  whether 
Jews  or  Gentiles.  For  the  sinners  with  whom  Christ  companied, 
thereby  causing  the  Pharisees  to  murmur  against  Him,  were  clearly 
Jews  and  not  Gentiles. 

The  elder  son  represents  the  just,  i.e.  those  who  were  really  just, 
as  well  as  those  who,  like  the  Scribes  and  Pharisees,  claimed  to 
be  such. 

The  younger  son,  the  prodigal,  is  put  for  open  and  notorious 
sinners,  such  as  the  publicans  and  harlots,  with  whom  Christ  was 
wont  to  associate  in  order  that  He  might  win  them  from  the  error 
of  their  way.  So  S.  Jerome  and  most  other  interpreters  explains 
the  parable. 

Ver.  12. — And  the  younger  of  them  said  to  his  father \ Father , give 
me  the  portion  of  goods  that  fatleth  to  me.  The  younger,  i.e.  sinners

and  harlots.  For  youth  is  less  restrained,  more  foolish,  more  incon- 
stant, and  more  prone  to  indulgences  of  every  kind.  According  to 
the  Fathers,  the  “goods,”  “substantia,”  must  be  taken  to  mean 
man’s  free  will,  called  in  Greek  |8/o;.  “ Because  by  it,”  says  S. 

Jerome,  “ man  lives  freely  and  as  it  pleases  him.”  “ For,”  observes 
Theophylact,  “ the  substance  of  man  is  the  capacity  of  reason  which 
is  accompanied  by  free  will.”  S.  Ambrose  and  others,  by  substance, 
understand  more  fitly  the  grace  of  God,  virtues  and  good  habits. 
For  it  is  these  which  are  really  wasted  and  destroyed  by  the  sinner, 
whilst  his  free  will  cannot  be  lost,  as  is  clear  from  the  parable.  You 
may  therefore  take  the  word  to  mean  all  the  gifts  of  God,  of  body 
and  soul,  of  nature  and  grace  ; for  these  the  younger  son  demands 
to  be  entirely  given  up  to  him,  because  he  was  unwilling  any  longer 
to  submit  to  the  authority  of  his  father,  but  desirous  of  being  his 
own  master,  and  of  being  free  to  use  or  abuse  the  gifts  of  God  as 
might  seem  to  him  good. 

So  S.  Augustine  (Quast.  Evang.  lib.  ii.  q.  35)  writes,  “To  live,  to 
understand,  to  remember,  to  excel  in  quickness  of  intellect,  these 
things  are  gifts  of  God,  which  men  receive  into  their  own  power  by 
freewill.”  So  also  S.  Jerome,  Titus,  and  Euthymius. 

And  he  divided  unto  them  his  living.  Placing  the  gifts  just  men- 
tioned at  the  free  disposal  of  each,  for  “ He  left  man  in  the  hand 
of  his  counsel”  Ecclus.  xv.  14. 

Ver.  13. — And  not  many  days  after  the  younger  son  gathered  all 
together , or,  according  to  the  Syriac  version,  “ collected  together  all 
that  had  come  to  him,”  and  took  his  journey  into  a far  country — “ far 
off,”  says  Euthymius,  “ not  by  local  separation,  but  by  separation 
in  point  of  virtue.”  Such  is  a state  of  concupiscence  and  sin,  for 
the  sinner  by  sinning  goes  far  from  God  and  from  heaven,  and 
subjects  himself  to  the  dominion  of  Satan.  “ But,”  says  Euthymius, 
“ the  elder  son  being  wise,  remained  with  his  father.” 

Hence  S.  Augustine  goes  on  to  say,  “The  far  country  is  forgetful- 
ness of  God,  a forgetfulness  which  is  mutual,  for  inasmuch  as  the 
sinner  forgets  God,  God  in  His  turn  is  in  a manner  forgetful  of  the 
sinner,  ie.  God  ceases  to  bestow  on  him  Hght,  grace,  or  guidance.”

For  S.  Jerome  says,  “ We  must  bear  in  mind  that  we  are  with  God, 
or  depart  from  Him,  according  to  our  disposition,  not  according  to 
4 distances  of  place.’  ” 

Therefore,  adds  Theophylact,  u when  a man  departs  from  God, 
and  from  the  fear  of  God,  he  wastes  and  consumes  all  God’s  gifts.” 

And  there  wasted  his  substance , Le.,  all  the  gifts  of  nature  and 
grace.  For  the  sinner,  giving  himself  up  to  pleasure  and  licentious- 
ness, incurs  the  loss  of  all  God’s  gifts  of  grace. 

He  becomes  dull  of  understanding  and  is  unable  to  recognise 
God,  or  the  beauty  of  holiness.  He  grows  forgetful  of  God’s  law 
and  God’s  goodness  towards  him.  He  so  corrupts  his  will  as  to 
prefer  vice  to  virtue,  pleasure  to  reason,  earth  to  heaven,  the  evil 
one  to  God ; and  forsaking  the  paths  of  virtue,  gives  himself  up  to 
every  kind  of  evil  Hence  he  becomes  destitute  of  counsel,  reason, 
sense,  and  everything  that  is  good ; and  at  last,  with  all  the  powers 
of  his  soul  and  body,  he  worships  the  creature  rather  than  the 
Creator,  and  falls  into  that  sin  to  which  the  Psalmist  refers,  “So 
they  that  forsake  Thee  shall  perish ; Thou  hast  destroyed  all  them 
that  commit  fornication  against  Thee.”  Ps.  lxxiil  26. 

The  prodigal  son  “ wasted  all  the  graces  of  nature,”  says  Euthy- 
mius,  because,  adds  S.  Augustine,  “he  made  a wrong  use  of  his 
natural  gifts.”  “He  then,”  says  Titus,  “expended  his  goods”  (sub- 
stantiam),  ie.9  the  light  which  was  in  him,  temperance,  the  know- 
ledge of  the  truth,  the  remembrance  of  God.  And  lastly,  says 
Euthymius  again,  “he  corrupted  the  gift  which  he  had  received 
at  his  baptism,  i.e.  nobility  of  soul,  and  the  capability  of  living  a 
godly  life,  for  such  things  as  these  made  up  the  riches  of  the 
prodigal 

With  riotous  living , By  living  an  abandoned  life  (d*<£r«;),  not 
only  sinful  but  also  luxurious  and  intemperate. 

“ A prodigal  life,”  says  the  Gloss,  “ loves  to  occupy  itself  in  out- 
ward show,  forgetful  of  God,  who  has  His  dwelling  within.” 

Ver.  14. — And  when  he  had  spent  all  ...  he  began  to  be  in  want. 
Or,  according  to  the  Arabic,  “ he  became  destitute,”  as  those  who 
lose  by  one  year’s  debauchery  all  that  their  parents  have  left  them  ;

and  after  that  are  reduced  to  misery  and  to  begging  their  bread. 
Nor  do  they  lose  their  property  only,  but  their  health  and  good 
name  as  well,  and  by  reason  of  the  foulness  of  their  habits  and  the 
diseases  which  they  contract,  become  a burden  to  themselves,  and 
a disgust  to  their  fellowraen.  For  it  is  acknowledged^by  all  that 
luxury  and  extravagance  make  the  richest  poor,  and  reduce  men 
to  the  very  verge  of  starvation. 

Mystically . The  sinner  suffers  from  the  want  of  all  things,  whether 
of  nature  or  of  grace,  because  he  turns  the  gifts  which  he  possesses 
to  his  own  destruction,  and  therefore  is  in  a far  worse  condition 
than  if  he  had  never  received  them. 

And  again,  the  sinner  being  without  God,  lacks  everything ; for 
all  things  depend  upon  Him,  and  in  Him  live  and  have  their  being. 
Hence  the  Interlinear,  “ Every  place  whence  the  Father  is  absent, 
is  a place  of  penury  and  want.”  For  he  who  has  not  God  possesses 
nothing,  although  he  be  king  of  the  whole  world.  Again,  he  who 
has  God  possesses  all  things,  although  he  may  not  have  a farthing 
to  call  his  own.  Or,  as  S.  Francis  expresses  it,  “ God  is  mine  and 
all  things.”  For  God  alone  can  be  said  to  be ; and  all  things  else 
compared  to  Him,  not  to  be.  See  Exod.  iii. 

Moreover,  the  Gloss  says,  “ Pleasure  always  hungers  for  itself — 
the  more  we  indulge  in  it,  the  more  insatiably  we  thirst  after  it ; ” 
and  a Jerome,  “ Our  health  and  strength  depart  from  us  by  reason 
of  our  sinful  indulgences,  yet  we  do  not  lose  the  desire  of  indulging. 

44  While  yet  in  sport,  for  other  sports  we  burn, 

In  gardens  fair,  for  other  gardens  yearn.” 

Ver.  15. — And  he  went  and  joined  himself  to  a citizen  of  that 
country , Le.,  to  an  evil  spirit,  for  the  devils  are  the  citizens  of  the 
country  far  off  from  God.  So  a Augustine  ( Quasi.  Evang.  lib.  ii. 
q.  33.)  says,  “He  joined  himself  to  a certain  prince  of  the  air 
belonging  to  the  army  of  the  devil,  whose  fields  signify  the  manner 
of  his  power.  The  swine  are  the  unclean  spirits  which  are  under 
him,  and  to  feed  them  is  to  work  those  things  in  which  they 
delight”

THE  PRODIGAL  REDUCED  TO  WANT.

So  also  S.  Ambrose,  “ The  citizen  is  the  prince  of  this  world,” 
and  in  like  manner  the  Gloss. 

S.  Peter  Chrysologus  (Serm.  a.)  says,  “Behold  the  effect  of 
unbridled  desires.  It  turned  a citizen  into  an  alien,  a son  into  a 
hireling,  a rich  man  ihto  a beggar,  a free  man  into  a slave.  It 
associated  him  whom  it  separated  from  a kind  father  with  swine ; 
that  he  who  had  despised  a holy  affection  might  be  the  slave  of  the 
greedy  herd.” 

S.  Ambrose  judges  rightly  that  by  the  expression  “ he  joined  himself 
to  ” we  are  to  understand  a dangerous  as  well  as  a laborious  service. 
For  as  a bird  is  snared  when  seeking  food,  so  the  unhappy  sinner, 
hoping  for  the  delights  of  freedom,  falls  into  a perilous  slavery. 

And  he  sent  him  into  his  field.  That  is,  says  Bede,  “ he  became 

a slave  of  earthly  desires.” 

To  feed  swine.  “To  feed  swine,”  says  S.  Chrysostom  in  the 
Catena , “ is  to  nourish  in  the  soul  sordid  and  unclean  thoughts.  See 
here  how  marvellously  the  condition  of  the  sinner  is  changed,  as  a 
just  punishment  for  the  foolish  use  he  made  of  his  freedom.  He 
who  was  unwilling  to  be  held  in  honour  as  a son,  is  obliged  to 
become  the  bond  slave  of  an  alien.  He  who  would  not  obey  the 
laws  of  God,  is  compelled  to  serve  Satan.  He  who  would  not  abide 
in  his  father's  palace,  is  sent  to  dwell  amongst  clowns.  He  who 
would  not  associate  with  his  brethren  and  with  princes,  becomes  the 
attendant  and  companion  of  swine.  He  who  refused  the  bread  of 
angels,  would  fain  satisfy  his  hunger  with  husks  from  the  hog- 
trough.” 

Ver.  1 6. — And  he  would  fain  have  filled  his  belly  with  the  husks 
that  the  swine  did  eat.  So  those  who  foolishly  squander  their  posses- 
sions on  others,  find  none  to  give  them  even  husks  in  their  misery 
and  want.  S.  Chrysostom  (Serm.  i)  says,  “Hunger,  to  luxury  a 
torment,  is  now  his  lot,  that  where  his  guilt  had  been  flagrant  there 
an  avenging  punishment  might  rage.”  And  again,  “ How  cruel  a 
service ! He  lives  with  unclean  animals,  yet  does  not  share  in  their 
feast  Wretched  man  that  he  is ; half  famished,  he  hungers  for  the 
swine’s  coarse  food,  yet  does  not  obtain  it"

S.  LUKE,  C.  XV. 


S.  Jerome  (Epist.  146)  here  remarks,  “that  the  Devil,  when  he 
has  brought  a man  into  subjection,  fires  his  soul  with  desires  of  all 
kinds,  but  cheats  him  of  their  gratification,  that  by  longing  after 
them  he  may  increase  his  guilt,  and  by  failing  to  gratify  them  may 
add  to  his  punishment  and  misery.”  Such  4s  the  deceitfulness  and 
the  tyranny  of  Satan.  “ Husks  ” are  the  empty  pods  of  beans,  peas, 
and  the  like,  which  fill  but  do  not  nourish  the  body.  Yet  country 
folk  mix  these  husks  with  flour  or  meal,  and  make  thereof  a common 
kind  of  black  bread  on  which  they  live.  Hence  Horace  ( Epist  1, 
lib.  ii.)  writes,  “He  lives  on  husks  and  coarse  bread.”  Jansenius 
understands  by  “ husks,”  the  fruit  of  the  Carob  tree,  which  is  like  a 
bean,  of  a blackish  colour,  curved,  as  long  as  a man’s  finger,  and  as 
broad  as  his  thumb.  Each  pod  contains  four  berries  called  ceratia 
from  their  likeness  to  a horn  (xt^at).  These  afford  excellent  food 
for  swine,  and  are  also  eaten  by  men. 

But  by  “ husks  ” the  Fathers  understand  “ that  worldly  and  vain 
knowledge  which  begets  vanity,  such  as  the  writings  of  the  poets, 
or  the  harangues  of  the  orators.”  “ Wherein,”  says  S.  Augustine, 
“ this  man  sought  to  find  something  belonging  to  the  higher  life, 
but  could  not”  The  word,  however,  may  be  taken  to  mean  more 
fully  “ carnal  gratifications  which  puff*  out  and  afflict  the  soul  but 
do  not  satisfy  its  yearnings.”  So  S.  Chrysostom  in  the  Catena 
writes,  “ If  thou  lovest  good  wine,  thou  lovest  husks ; if  thou  longest 
for  gold,  thou  dost  seek  for  husks ; if  thou  followest  after  sensual 
pleasures,  thou  askest  for  the  food  of  swine.” 

Ver.  17. — And  when  he  came  to  himself,  or,  as  the  Arabic  renders 
it,  “when  he  was  considering  within  himself.”  Euthymius  says, 
“ becoming  master  of  himself,  and  as  it  were  waking  up  from  the 
deep  sleep  of  the  drunken.”  “ Returning  from  his  wanderings 
abroad.”  Theophylact  “ For,”  says  the  Interlinear,  “ he  who  has 
gone  away  from  himself  does  well  to  return  ; ” and  the  prodigal  had 
been  in  a manner  beside  himself,  and  a raving  madman,  but  his 
misery  gave  him  understanding,  and  hunger  taught  him  to  be  wise. 
So  S.  Gregory  Nyssen.  {Tract de  Oratione)  writes,  “ He  did  not  return 
to  his  former  state  of  happiness  until  coming  to  himself*  he  felt  the

377 


full  weight  of  his  cares.”  And  S.  Augustine  (Quasi.  Evang . lib.  xxi.) : 
44  He  turned  his  thoughts  (intentionem)  from  these  things,  which 
act  externally  as  snares  and  temptations,  to  his  inner  conscience.” 
44  For,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  44  he  who  returns  to  it  returns  to  himself, 
but  he  who  departs  from  Christ  forfeits  his  rights  in  Christ” 

How  many  hired  servants  of  my  father’s,  Ac.  They  have  bread 
enough  and  to  spare,  but  I,  his  son,  am  perishing  with  hunger. 
So  God  is  wont  to  take  away  from  those  who  live  for  pleasure  all 
their  delights,  and  send  them  hunger,  sickness,  and  pain,  that  they 
may  return  to  a better  mind,  and  see  what  happiness  they  have 
forfeited,  and  into  what  misery  they  have  fallen ; which  is  the  first 
stage  of  repentance.  Hence  Titus  writes,  44  Coming  to  himself,  i.e. 
comparing  his  former  happiness  with  his  after  misery,  he  thought 
of  what  he  was  whilst  he  abode  with  his  father,  and  meditated  over 
and  over  again  on  the  vile  and  wretched  state  to  which  he  had 
reduced  himself  by  his  rejection  of  God,  and  subjection  to  Satan.” 
Learn  then  from  the  example  of  the  prodigal,  that  44  repentance 
follows  on  hasty  counsel,  and  that  a bad  beginning  makes  a bad 
ending;”  and  again,  “that  thou  be  not  conquered  by  a shameful 
adversary,  regard  pleasure  only  when  it  is  departing  from  thee,  for 
pleasure  is  the  food  of  the  wicked.” 

Mystically.  If  we  serve  God  and  follow  virtue  in  hope  of  worldly 
gain,  we  are  hirelings ; if  from  fear,  slaves  ; if  from  love,  sons. 
As  the  Interlinear  says,  44  How  many  Jews  are  there  who  keep  the 
law  only  for  the  sake  of  present  prosperity,  and  obtain  of  God  that 
which  they  desire ; but  I,  who  neglect  God's  law,  prosper  neither  in 
my  temporal  nor  my  spiritual  concerns.” 

S.  Augustine,  on  the  other  hand,  says,  44  These  are  the  reflections 
of  a man  who  is  coming  to  a better  mind  again,  and  finds  himself 
amongst  those  who  preach  the  truth,  not  from  love  of  the  truth,  but 
from  the  desire  of  earthly  gain.”  But  the  Gloss  takes  higher  ground : 
44  The  hirelings  are  they  who  busy  themselves  in  walking  worthily, 
looking  for  the  reward  which  is  to  be.  These  have  bread  enough 
and  to  spare,  i.e.  they  are  sustained  by  the  daily  nourishment  of 
Divine  grace.”

S.  LUKE,  C.  XV. 


He  then  who  is  restrained  from  vice  by  fear  of  punishment  is  the 
slave ; by  hope  and  longing  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  the  hireling ; 
by  love  of  that  which  is  good,  the  son.  And  Theophylact,  in  like 
manner,  makes  this  threefold  distinction  amongst  those  who  are 
saved. 

The  Interlinear  again,  and  others  who  understand  by  the  two 
sons  the  Jews  and  Gentiles,  explain  thus : 44  The  Jews,  who  like  hire- 
lings serve  God  in  hope  of  obtaining  the  good  things  of  this  world, 
possess  them  plentifully ; but  the  people  of  the  Gentiles,  together 
with  the  idolaters,  are  wholly  cut  off  from  the  truth.” 

Ver.  18. — I will  arise  and  go  to  my  father . “I  will  arise,”  says 
the  Interlinear,  “ because  I perceive  that  I have  fallen  prone  before 
idolatry  and  vice.  I will  go  to  my  father,  for  I have  wandered  far 
from  him,  and  am  wearing  away  my  life  in  misery  and  want  I will 
rise  from  this  wretched  life.  I will  break  away  from  my  vices,  cease 
from  sin,  amend  my  life.  I will  repent,  and  humbly  beg  of  God  the 
pardon  of  my  sia” 

44  Well  does  he  say,  4 1 will  arise,’  ” writes  S.  Jerome  (Epist  146), 
44  for  away  from  his  father  he  could  not  stand  upright.  It  is  the  part 
of  sinners  to  lie  prone,  of  the  just  to  stand  upright”  For  as  Chry- 
sologus  (Serm,  1)  says, 44  As  long  as  a man  is  with  his  father,  his  state 
is  happy,  his  service  free,  and  his  safety  assured.  He  reverences 
his  father  with  gladness.  If  corrected  it  is  with  gentleness.  Though 
poor  he  is  rich,  and  his  possessions  are  secure.”  And  again,  44  he 
determines  to  return,  because  he  perceived  that  with  a stranger  his 
liberty  was  slavery,  and  because  he  believed  that  with  his  father  his 
slavery  would  be  liberty.” 

And  will  say  unto  him.  These  words,  says  Titus,  are  few,  but 
enough  for  my  salvation;  for  I know  my  father’s  loving-kindness, 
and  that  he  will  have  compassion  on  the  penitent,  whom  he  did  not 
abandon,  even  when  wallowing  in  the  foulness  of  sin. 

Father , I have  sinned,  44  This,”  says  S.  Ambrose, 44  is  his  first  con- 
fession to  the  author  of  nature,  the  dispenser  of  mercy,  the  judge 
of  his  sin.  For  although  God  knows  all  things,  He  waits  to  hear 
the  acknowledgment  of  our  sins,  because  he  who  takes  the  burden

of  his  sin  upon  himself  lessens  its  weight,  and  he  who  by  confession 
anticipates  the  accuser,  deprives  the  accusation  of  its  sting.  In  vain 
wilt  thou  endeavour  to  hide  from  Him,  whom  nothing  escapes,  and 
you  may  safely  discover  what  you  know  to  be  already  known.’1 

God,  therefore,  justly  and  fitly  demands  of  the  sinner  the  confes- 
sion of  his  sin. 

1.  Because  a criminal  ought  to  humble  himself,  and  confess  his 
crime,  if  he  would  be  forgiven. 

2.  Because,  according  to  Origen  {Horn.  ii.  on  Ps.  xxxviil),  as  a 
disordered  stomach  must  be  purged  by  emetics,  so  must  the  soul 
which  is  full  of  corruption  be  purified  by  confession. 

3.  Because  the  sinner  has  cast  contempt  on  the  majesty  of  God, 
and  can  only  make  amends  for  his  fault  by  repentance.  For 
repentance  gives  glory  to  God,  and  restores  to  Him  the  honour 
which  sin  takes  away.  In  a word,  the  penitent  acknowledges  that 
he  himself  is  a sinner,  but  that  God  is  most  holy. 

4.  The  confession  of  the  sinner  therefore  is  for  the  praise  and 
glory  of  God  the  Creator,  as  well  as  of  Jesus  Christ  our  Saviour. 
“ For,"  says  S.  Cyprian,  or  the  author  of  the  Treatise  on  the  Pas- 
sion, whoever  he  may  be,  “ when  the  sinner  takes  upon  himself  the 
office  of  judge  and  tormentor,  becoming  his  own  prosecutor,  and 
showing  by  the  shame  he  exhibits  that  his  confession  is  genuine,  his 
entire  self-sacrifice  obtains  pardon  for  him  in  the  sight  of  God. 
For  God  does  not  pass  judgment  twice  on  the  same  offence.” 

Against  heaven.  That  is,  (1.)  I have  sinned  so  grievously  that 
my  sins,  as  it  were,  cry  to  heaven  for  vengeance,  or  by  a Hebraism, 
we  may  understand  “against  heaven”  to  mean,  against  God  who 
dwelleth  therein.  (See  S.  Matt  xxl  25.) 

2.  “Against  heaven,”  because  in  preferring  earth  to  heaven,  I 
have  committed  a great  wrong  and  have  lightly  esteemed  heavenly 
things ; so  that  if  heaven  were  endowed  with  voice  and  reason,  it 
would  cry  out  and  make  accusation  against  me. 

3.  “ Against  heaven  ” because  heaven  is  my  home,  and  I am  only 
a sojourner  here  on  earth.  I have  therefore  betrayed  my  native 
land.  So  S.  Gregory  Nyssen,  {De  Orations ),  says,  “ He  would  not

S.  LUKE,  C.  XV. 


have  confessed  that  he  had  sinned  against  heaven,  unless  he  had 
been  persuaded  that  heaven  was  his  country  and  that  he  had  sinned 
in  leaving  it.”  And  S.  Jerome,  “ He  sins  against  heaven  who  leaves 
the  heavenly  Jerusalem.” 

4.  “Against  heaven,”  i.e.  “against  the  angels  and  those  that 
dwell  therein,”  says  the  Interlinear,  and  also  S.  Augustine. 

5.  Or  “ against  heaven  ” because  according  to  S.  Ambrose,  “ he 
had  wasted  the  gifts  of  heaven.”  By  which  we  may  understand  “the 
endowments  of  the  soul  and  the  spiritual  gifts  which  are  impaired 
by  sin  and  by  our  departure  from  the  heavenly  Jerusalem,  which  is 
the  mother  of  us  all” 

Symbolically , S.  Chrysostom,  in  the  Catena , says,  “ He  sins  against 
neaven  who  sins  against  the  humanity  of  Christ,  which  although 
above  us  as  heaven,  is  yet  visible.”  For  the  sinner  makes  of  none 
effect  the  blood  of  Christ,  and  in  a manner  “ crucifies  the  Son  of 
God  afresh.”  Heb.  vi.  6. 

And  before  Thee  “ Who  alone,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ seest  all 
things,  and  to  whom  the  thoughts  of  all  hearts  are  revealed.  Great 
then  is  the  shamelessness  of  the  sinner  in  daring  to  sin  before  the 
living  God,  who  will  punish  him  for  his  offences  in  the  day  of  judg- 
ment, and  who  not  unfrequently  inflicts  punishment  in  this  life  as 
a warning  to  others  not  to  offend.” 

S.  Jerome  here  explains  that  “ he  had  sinned  against  his  father 
in  that,  forsaking  his  Creator,  he  had  bowed  down  in  worship  to  idols 
of  wood  and  of  stone.” 

Symbolically , S.  Augustine  ( Quasi l.  Evang.  lib.  ii.  q.  33)  interprets 
the  words  “ before  thee  ” to  mean  “ in  the  inmost  conscience.”  For 
the  sinner  ought  to  blush  even  for  the  sins  which  he  commits  in 
secret,  and  for  the  conscience  which  he  defiles,  renders  dumb,  and 
hands  over  to  Satan. 

Ver.  19. — And  am  no  more  worthy  to  be  called  thy  son.  Because, 
says  S.  Jerome,  I preferred  to  serve  idols,  and  to  be  the  slave  of 
vices.  “ He  does  not  presume,”  says  Bede,  “ to  ask  to  be  treated 
as  a son,”  because,  adds  Euthymius,  “ his  life  had  been  unworthy  of 
such  a father.”

Make  me  as  one  of  thy  hired  servants . I have  forfeited  my  posi- 
tion as  son,  but  cast  me  not  out  of  thy  presence,  suffer  me  to  take 
the  lowest  place  in  thy  household,  says  Euthymius,  that  I may  make 
open  confession  of  my  sin.  For  formerly  those  who  had  been  put 
to  public  penance  were  not  allowed  to  enter  the  church,  but  knelt 
without,  humbly  asking  the  prayers  and  the  pardon  of  all,  as  S. 
Jerome  tells  us  that  Fabiola  did. 

These,  says  S.  Augustine  (lib.  ii.  Quast.  Evang.  q.  33),  are  the 
words  of  one  who  is  turning  his  thoughts  to  repentance,  not  of  one 
actually  repentant  For  he  is  not  addressing  his  father,  but  only  deter- 
mining what  to  say  when  he  meets  him.  “ But,”  says  Primasius,  com- 
menting on  Rev.  iv.,  “as  the  smoke  precedes  the  flame,  so  must 
there  be  confession  of  sin  before  the  fires  of  faith  and  love  are  kindled 
in  the  sinner’s  heart.  Hence  the  smoke  bursts  into  flame  as  the 
fire  gains  power  and  intensity ; so  in  like  manner  confession  of  sin 
through  force  of  contrition  bums  up  and  becomes  aflame  with  love.” 

Ver.  20. — But  when  he  was  yet  a great  way  off,  his  father  saw  him. 
Before  he  had  given  any  expression  to  his  penitence,  his  father  pre- 
vented him. 

See  here  God’s  wonderful  loving-kindness  towards  penitent  sinners. 
“ He  is  wont,”  says  Titus,  “in  His  mercy  and  pity  to  anticipate  the 
repentance  of  men;”  and,  adds  S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa,  “when  he 
resolved  to  repent,  his  father  was  reconciled  to  him.” 

And  had  compassion , was  moved  with  pity  at  the  sight 

of  his  misery. 

And  ran.  In  excess  of  joy,  says  Euthymius,  he  waited  not 
for  him  to  draw  nigh,  but  went  to  meet  him,  running  and  thereby 
showing  the  greatness  of  his  love. 

And  fell  on  his  neck , and  kissed  him.  “To  fall  on  his  neck,” 
says  S.  Augustine,  “ is  to  lower  to  his  embrace  the  arm  of  God,  which 
is  Christ ; to  give  the  kiss  is  to  comfort  by  the  word  of  God’s  grace 
unto  the  hope  of  pardon  of  sin.”  But  S.  Chrysostom  says,  “ The 
mouth  is  kissed  as  that  from  which  the  heartfelt  confession  of  the 
penitent  proceeded.” 

The  embrace  and  the  kiss  are  here  set  forth  as  the  tokens  of

pardon  and  reconciliation,  and  of  especial  love  and  goodwill,  as 
well  as  of  the  exultation  and  joy  with  which  God  and  His  angels 
regard  a sinner  that  repenteth. 

Ver.  21. — And  the  son  said  unto  him , Father , / have  sinned , &c. 
He  desires,  says  the  Interlinear,  that  to  be  done  by  grace,  which  he 
acknowledges  himself  to  be  unworthy  of  by  any  merit  of  his  own. 
(See  above  on  ver.  18.)  He  omits  to  say,  “make  me  as  one  of  thy 
hired  servants,”  either  because  his  father,  out  of  love  and  joy,  had 
cut  short  his  confession,  by  bidding  the  attendants  “ bring  forth  the 
best  robe,”  or  because  his  father’s  embrace  and  kiss  had  encouraged 
him  to  hope  that  again  he  might  be  acknowledged  as  a son.  “ He 
does  not  add,”  says  S.  Augustine  (Lib.  ii.  Qucest.  Evang.  q.  33), 
“what  he  had  before  determined  to  say,  for  after  the  kiss  of  his  fathei 
he  most  nobly  disdained  to  become  a hireling.”  Titus,  however,  is 
of  opinion  that  the  words  were  actually  uttered,  although  S.  Luke  has 
not  recorded  them. 

Ver.  22. — But  the  father  said  to  his  servants , &c.  “The  servants,” 
says  Theophylact,  “ are  the  angels  or  the  priests,”  or,  according  to  S. 
Augustine,  the  preachers,  for  by  their  ministry  God  reconciles  sinners 
to  Himself. 

The  best  robe.  The  “ first  ” robe,  that  which  he  was  wont  to  wear  be- 
fore he  left  his  father’s  house,  for  from  the  repetition  of  the  article  o|» 
vftonjr,  it  is  clear  that  some  particular  garment  is  indicated. 

Hence,  in  the  lives  of  the  Fathers,  it  is  related  that  a certain 
Bishop  saw  in  a vision  two  women  who  were  sinners,  clothed,  after 
having  made  sacramental  confession,  in  white  garments  and  radiant 
with  light.  He  inquired  the  cause  of  this  from  an  angel  that  appeared 
unto  him,  and  was  told  that  the  women,  by  their  confession  and  tears, 
had  rendered  themselves  worthy  to  be  numbered  with  the  elect. 

And  put  a ring  on  his  handy  and  shoes  on  his  feet . A ring  of 
gold,  i.e.  the  mark  of  a free  and  rich  or  noble  man,  as  also  are 
shoes,  for  slaves  go  barefoot,  but  citizens  are  shod. 

Ver.  23. — And  bring  hither  the  fatted  caff.  rw  that  parti- 

cular calf  which  I ordered  to  be  fattened  for  such  a solemn  occasion 
as  this.

THE  PENITENT  CLOTHED  AND  FEASTED.  383 


All  these  things,  the  robe,  the  ring,  the  shoes,  and  the  fatted  calf, 
show  the  delight  of  the  father,  i,e.  the  joy  of  God  and  His  angels 
at  the  conversion  of  a sinner,  and  teach  us  that  by  the  great  mercy 
of  God,  a penitent  is  restored  to  the  same,  or  even  a better  position 
than  that  which  he  held  before  he  fell  into  sin. 

But  with  S.  Augustine,  S.  Jerome,  and  Bede,  we  may  attach  a 
separate  meaning  to  each. 

So  we  may  take  the  best  robe  to  mean  not  innocence,  for  this 
once  lost  cannot  be  regained,  but  first  grace  and  love.  Thus  the 
Interlinear  interprets  it  as,  “ the  robe  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  which  is  an 
earnest  of  immortal  life.”  According  to  S.  Ambrose,  it  is  “the 
cloke  of  wisdom ; ” but  S.  Augustine  considers  it  “ the  dignity  which 
Adam  lost” 

By  the  ring  we  may  understand  the  express  image  of  God,  which 
some  see  in  one  virtue,  some  in  another. 

“ The  ring,”  says  Bede,  “ is  the  seal  of  our  unfeigned  faith,”  or, 
according  to  S.  Chrysostom  in  the  Catena, , the  symbol  of  the  seal  of 
salvation,  or  rather,  the  badge  of  betrothment,  the  pledge  of  nuptials 
with  Christ  It  is  “ the  signet  of  faith  with  which  the  promises  are 
sealed  in  the  hearts  of  the  faithful.”  Gloss.  “ The  seal  of  Christ’s 
image,  and  impress  of  the  truth.”  Interlinear.  “ The  pledge  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  because  of  the  participation  of  grace,  which  is  well 
signified  by  the  finger.”  S.  Augustine  See  Gen.  xli.  42 ; Jer.  xxii. 
24;  Hag.  ii.  23. 

“ On  his  hand,”  ie.  by  his  working,  that  his  faith  may  be  made 
manifest  by  his  works,  and  that  his  works  may  be  established  by  his 
faith.  Interlinear. 

By  “ the  shoes  on  his  feet  ” is  typified  promptitude  in  the  exercise 
of  acts  of  virtue,  particularly  as  regards  the  preaching  of  the  gospel ; 
for  those  who  are  converted  greatly  desire  the  conversion  of  others. 
Or,  as  S.  Augustine  explains,  “The  shoes  are  the  preparation  for 
preaching  the  gospel,  in  order  not  to  touch  earthly  things,”  that,  says 
S.  Chrysostom,  “a  man  may  walk  firmly  along  the  slippery  path 
of  the  world”;  the  course  of  our  life  is  called  in  Scripture  a 
foot  (pes).

Again,  “ the  shoes  ” are  the  examples  of  good  men,  which,  as  it 
were,  leave  footprints,  to  enable  us  to  follow  in  their  steps. 

“ The  fatted  calf”  is  a figure  of  Christ,  who  in  the  Eucharist  feeds  the 
just,  and  those  sinners  who  are  penitent,  with  His  body  and  His  blood; 
comforting  and  soothing  in  a wonderful  manner  those  who  have  been 
newly  converted  as  well  as  those  who  have  long  since  repented. 

Hence  the  Interlinear  says,  “ Christ  is  the  fatted  calf  abounding 
in  every  spiritual  virtue,  so  that  He  suffices  for  the  salvation  of  the 
whole  world.”  And  S.  Chrysostom  : “ Christ  is  called  the  calf,  because 
of  the  sacrifice  of  His  body,  and  fatted,  because  He  made  satisfac- 
tion for  alL”  And  Augustine : “ The  fatted  calf  is  our  Lord  Him- 
self in  the  flesh,  loaded  with  insults.  The  father  commands  it  to 
be  brought,  i.e . commands  Christ  to  be  preached.  He  also  bids 
them  kill  it,  in  allusion  to  the  death  of  Christ  For  He  is  then 
killed  to  each  man  who  believes  him  slain.” 

Let  us  eat  and  be  merry . God,  says  Euthymius,  is  said  to  eat  in 
proof  of  His  joy.  " For,”  adds  S.  Jerome  (Ep.  146),  “there  can  be  no 
rejoicing  if  our  Father  be  absent  from  the  feast,”  because,  says  Bede 
and  S.  Ambrose,  M the  food  of  the  Father  is  our  salvation ; the  joy 
of  the  Father  the  redemption  of  our  sins.”  And  according  to  the 
Gloss,  “The  salvation  of  sinners  is  the  refreshment  of  God  and 
the  saints.  Observe  also  that  the  calf  is  slain  after  that  the  robe, 
the  ring,  and  the  shoes  are  provided,  to  teach  us  that  we  must  put 
on  the  hope  of  the  immortality  for  which  we  were  created,  that  we 
must  seal  our  works  with  the  signet  of  faith,  and  preach  by  the  con- 
fession of  Christ,  if  we  would  partake  of  the  heavenly  mysteries.” 
Ver.  24. — For  this  my  son  was  dead , and  is  alive  again*  He 
was  dead  by  reason  of  his  sins ; he  is  alive  again  because  of  his 
repentance. 

Ver.  28. — And  he  was  angry , and  would  not  go  in.  The  anger 
and  the  murmuring  of  the  elder  son  is  the  application  of  the  parable, 
and  is  intended  to  show  how  justly  God  rejoices  over  the  conver- 
sion of  a sinner,  and  what  answer  can  be  given  to  those  who  mur- 
mur at  the  consideration  shown  to  those  that  repent 

“ Hence  we  learn,”  says  Euthymiut,  " that  God  rejoices  so  greatly

THE  ELDER  SON’S  ANGER.  385 

over  the  return  of  the  prodigal,  in  order  that  He  may  provoke  others 
to  jealousy.” 

So  also  Theophylact,  Titus,  and  S.  Chrysostom  in  the  Catena ; 
for  it  is  certain  that  the  righteous  do  not  envy  penitent  sinners  the 
blessings  they  enjoy,  but  rejoice  greatly  and  exult  in  their  happiness. 
See  S.  Matt.  xx.  11. 

Hence  we  are  to  understand  rather  by  the  murmuring  of  the 
elder  son,  the  envy  of  the  Pharisees  who  murmured  against  Christ 
because  He  received  sinners.  For  this  was  the  occasion  as  well  as 
scope  of  the  parable,  as  is  clear  from  the  opening  verses  of  the 
chapter.  Similarly  also  the  parable  applies  to  the  Jews,  who  hated 
the  Apostles  and  murmured  against  them,  because  they  preached 
the  Gospel  to  the  Gentiles.  So  S.  Ambrose  says,  a The  Jews  envied 
the  Gentiles  the  paternal  blessing,”  and  S.  Augustine  ( Quasi . Evang. 
ii.  33),  “ He  is  angry  now,  and  will  not  go  in.  But  when  the  fulness 
of  the  nations  shall  have  entered  in,  then  the  father  will  go  forth  that 
all  Israel  may  be  saved.”  Again  S.  Ambrose,  " He  is  called  the 
elder  because  he  envied  his  brother,  and  envy  causes  a man  very 
quickly  to  grow  old.” 

He  heard  music  and  dancing . That  is,  as  S.  Augustine  explains, 
“ He  heard  the  Apostles  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  preaching  the  Gospel 
with  harmonious  voices.  He  takes  one  of  the  prophets  to  read, 
and  as  he  searches  in  it,  asks  in  a manner,  why  are  these  feasts 
celebrated  in  the  Church  at  which  he  finds  himself  not  present” 
But  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ He  heard  the  harmony  of  the  Christian 
people  singing  with  united  voice,  and  raising  sweet  sounding  strains 
of  joy  over  the  salvation  of  the  sinner.  But  he  stands  without,  for 
his  evil  disposition  hinders  him  from  entering  in ; ” and  the  Gloss, 
“The  Church’s  symphony  is  the  accord  of  different  ages  and  varying 
virtues,  whence  the  chorus  and  spiritual  dance  of  holy  and  exul- 
tant joy.” 

Tropologically%  S.  Jerome  (. Epist . 146)  says,  “ Daily  is  this  feast 
kept,  daily  does  the  Father  receive  His  Son,  for  Christ  is  ever  being 
crucified  for  them  that  believe.”  See  also  Salmeron  (Tom.  vil 
Tract.  27  and  28).

Iherefore  came  his  j other  out  and  intreated  him. — Symbolically , 
this  signifies  that  God  through  the  preaching  of  Christ  and  His 
Apostles  invited  the  Pharisees  and  the  unbelieving  Jews  to  enter  His 
Church,  and  therein  to  partake  of  the  gospel  feast,  and  share  in  the 
joy  of  the  faithful  But  they  refused  the  invitation  from  hatred  of 
Christ  crucified,  and  because  they  were  offended  that  the  Gentiles 
should  believe  on  Him,  and  they  will  remain  obstinate  in  their  refusal 
until  the  coming  of  Elias  at  the  end  of  the  world.  So  S.  Augustine 
bids  us  “ admire  God’s  goodness  towards  His  people;”  and  & 
Jerome,  “ How  kind  and  how  merciful  a father ! He  asks  his  son 
to  share  in  the  joy  of  the  household.” 

Ver.  29. — And  he  answering  said , Lo , these  many  years  do  1 
serve  thee.  The  Syriac  has  uservio  tibi  servitutem”  so  the  Jews 
were  in  bondage  to  the  observance  of  the  law. 

Neither  transgressed  I at  any  time  thy  commandment.  This 
answer  shows  the  lying  arrogance  and  the  ingratitude  of  the  Jews, 
who  boasted  of  their  work  done  under  the  law,  and  forgot  the 
many  benefits  which  God  had  conferred  upon  them.  They  lie  when 
they  say  they  have  never  transgressed  the  commandment  of  God. 
They  transgress  often  I For,  says  St  Jerome  (Ep.  146),  “ Is  it  not 
a transgression  to  envy  our  brother  his  salvation  ? ” With  like  arro- 
gancy,  the  Pharisee  justifies  himselfj  and  despises  the  Publican.  St 
Luke  xviii.  1 1.  But  as  St  Augustine  and  the  Interlinear  point  out, 
the  Jews  did  not  bow  down  to  idols,  as  the  Gentiles  did,  and  there- 
fore, inasmuch  as  they  worshipped  the  one  true  God,  and  Him 
alone,  in  this  particular  they  did  not  transgress  the  command- 
ment 

And  yet  thou  never  gavest  me  a kid.  The  fathers  explain  this 
symbolically  in  many  ways.  ^ 

“ No  blood  of  prophet  or  priest  has  delivered  us  from  the  Roman 
yoke,  but  for  the  prodigal,  *>.,  for  the  Gentiles,  for  sinners,  through- 
out the  whole  world,  Thy  precious  blood  was  shed.”  St  Jerome 
(Ep.  146),  14  Thou  hast  never,  for  my  sake,  ordered  a kid,  i.e.  a 
sinner  who  persecuted  me,  to  be  slain.”  Theophylact 

“Thou,  O Christ,  hast  never  given  me  Thyself  for  my  food,

THE  FATHER'S  REMONSTRANCE.  387 

because  I accounted  Thee  as  a kid,  i.e.,  as  a sinner,  and  a perverter 
of  the  Law.”  St  Augustine. 

“ The  Jews  demand  a kid : the  Christians  a lamb.  For  them 
Barabbas  is  set  free ; for  us  the  lamb  is  slain.”  St  Ambrose. 

Ver.  30. — This  thy  son  . . . which  hath  devoured  thy  living  with 
harlots . The  Pharisees  accuse  God  of  sin,  in  preferring  the  un- 
worthy to  the  worthy,  Gentiles  to  the  Jews,  sinners  to  them- 
selves, as  if  He  had  regard  to  the  persons  of  men ; but  their  accusation 
is  false.  For  the  Gentiles,  though  sinners,  by  their  repentance  and 
faith  made  themselves  worthy  of  the  gospel  and  the  grace  of  Christ ; 
but  the  Pharisees,  by  their  pride,  envy,  and  unbelief,  showed  them- 
selves unworthy  of  these  benefits.  Hence  they  became  reprobate, 
and  the  Gentiles  were  chosen  in  their  stead.  See  S.  Matt.  xx.  16. 

Ver.  31. — And  he  said  unto  him,  Son,  thou  art  ever  with  me,  and 
all  that  1 have  is  thine.  “ The  law,  the  prophets,  the  oracles  of 
God,”  says  St  Jerome.  To  this  we  must  add,  the  worship  of  the 
one  true  God,  and  faith  in  Him,  in  the  teachings  of  the  Church,  and 
the  benefits  arising  therefrom.  For  all  these  blessings,  which  were 
lacking  to  the  Gentiles  before  the  coming  of  Christ,  were  the 
possession  of  God’s  people  Israel. 

The  sense  is,  u Thou,  as  my  son,  art  at  liberty  to  enjoy  all  my 
possessions,  as  seems  to  thee  good.  Thou  oughtest  not  then  to 
envy  thy  brother,  or  to  take  it  amiss  that  out  of  our  common 
property,  I have  ordered  a calf  to  be  slain,  in  honour  of  his  return, 
especially  as  thou  also  art  invited  to  the  banquet.”  St  Ambrose. 
And  the  Interlinear  adds,  “ All  mine  is  thine,  if  so  be  thou  ceasest  to 
envy  thy  brother,”  for,  says  St  Augustine,  “ desire  obtains  nothing 
without  want,  charity  nothing  with  want,  and  when  we  shall  have 
obtained  that  blessedness,  the  higher  things  will  be  ours  to  live 
upon,  equal  things  ours  to  have  fellowship  with,  the  lower  things 
ours  to  rule;”  and  he  assigns  the  reason,  “for  it  is  thus  that  all 
things  are  looked  upon  by  perfect  and  immortal  children,  that  each 
is  the  possession  of  all,  and  all  of  each.”  Hence  there  will  arise 
for  the  blessed  hereafter  the  perfection  of  mutual  charity  and  love, 
and  the  fulness  of  glory  and  of  bliss.

Ver.  32. — It  was  meet  that  we  should  make  merry  and  be  glad. 
For  the  most  convincing  of  reasons,  because  this  my  son,  thy  brother, 
who  was  dead  in  trespasses  and  sins,  is  now  restored  to  ferace  and 
favour,  wherefore  it  behovest  thee  to  take  part  in  our  rejoicing,  and 
not  to  be  envious  and  to  murmur  against  him. 

Christ  now  leaves  the  Pharisees  to  apply  the  parable  to  themselves. 
For,  says  Theophylact,  “ It  is  intended  to  teach  that  although  we 
may  be  just,  we  must  not  cast  off  sinners  nor  murmur  because  God 
receives  them;"  and  again,  “The  Lord  speaks  as  it  were  after  this 
manner ; I beseech  you  who  are  righteous  and  free  from  reproach, 
that  ye  murmur  not  at  the  salvation  of  sons,  for  this  prodigal  is  still 
a son.”

CHAPTER  XVI. 


I  7 he  parable  of  the  unjust  steward,  14  Christ  reproveth  tne  hypocrisy  of  the 
covetous  Pharisees . 19  The  rich  glutton , and  Lazarus  the  beggar, 

AND  he  said  also  unto  his  disciples,  There  was  a certain  rich  man,  which  had 
a steward ; and  the  same  was  accused  unto  him  that  he  had  wasted  his 

goods. 

2  And  he  called  him,  and  said  unto  him,  How  is  it  that  I hear  this  of  thee? 
give  an  account  of  thy  stewardship ; for  thou  mayest  be  no  longer  steward. 

3  Then  the  steward  said  within  himself,  What  shall  I do?  for  my  lord  taketh 
away  from  me  the  stewardship  : I cannot  dig ; to  beg  I am  ashamed. 

4  I am  resolved  what  to  do,  that,  when  I am  put  out  of  the  stewardship,  they 
may  receive  me  into  their  houses. 

5  So  he  called  every  one  of  his  lord’s  debtors  unto  him , and  said  unto  the  first 
How  much  owest  thou  unto  my  lord  ? 

6  And  he  said.  An  hundred  measures  of  oil  And  he  said  unto  him,  Take  thy 
bill,  and  sit  down  quickly,  and  write  fifty. 

7  Then  he  said  to  another.  And  how  much  owest  thou?  And  he  said,  An 
hundred  measures  of  wheat  And  he  said  unto  him,  Take  thy  bill,  and  write 
fourscore. 

8  And  the  lord  commended  the  unjust  steward,  because  he  had  done  wisely : foi 
the  children  of  this  world  are  in  their  generation  wiser  than  the  children  of  light 
9 And  I say  unto  you,  Make  to  yourselves  friends  of  the  mammon  of  unright- 
eousness ; that,  when  ye  fail,  they  may  receive  you  into  everlasting  habitations. 

10  He  that  is  faithful  in  that  which  is  least  is  faithful  also  in  much : and  he 
that  is  unjust  in  the  least  is  unjust  also  in  much. 

II  If  therefore  ye  have  not  been  faithful  in  the  unrighteous  mammon,  who  will 
commit  to  your  trust  the  true  riches  t 

12  And  if  ye  have  not  been  faithful  in  that  which  is  another  man’s,  who  shall 
give  you  that  which  is  your  own  ? 

13  H No  servant  can  serve  two  masters : for  either  he  will  hate  the  one,  and 
love  the  other;  or  else  he  will  hold  to  the  one,  and  despise  the  other.  Ye  cannot 
serve  God  and  mammon. 

14  And  the  Pharisees  also,  who  were  covetous,  heard  all  these  things:  and 
they  derided  him. 

15  And  he  said  unto  them,  Ye  are  they  which  justify  yourselves  before  men  ; 
but  God  knoweth  your  hearts  : for  that  which  is  highly  esteemed  among  men  is 
abomination  in  the  sight  of  God. 

16  The  law  and  the  prophets  were  until  John  : since  that  time  the  kingdom  of 
God  is  preached,  and  every  man  presseth  unto  it

adultery : and  whosoever  marrieth  her  that  is  put  away  from  her  husband  com- 
mitteth adultery. 

19  IT  There  was  a certain  rich  man,  which  was  clothed  in  purple  and  fine  linen, 
and  fared  sumptuously  every  day  : 

20  And  there  was  a certain  beggar  named  Lazarus,  which  was  laid  at  his  gate, 
full  of  sores, 

21  And  desiring  to  be  fed  with  the  crumbs  which  fell  from  the  rich  man's 
table  : moreover  the  dogs  came  and  licked  his  sores. 

22  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  the  beggar  died,  and  was  carried  by  the  angels 
into  Abraham's  bosom  : the  rich  man  also  died,  and  was  buried ; 

23  And  in  hell  he  lift  up  his  eyes,  being  in  torments,  and  seeth  Abraham  afar 
off,  and  Lazarus  in  his  bosom. 

24  And  he  cried  and  said,  Father  Abraham,  have  mercy  on  me,  and  send 
Lazarus,  that  he  may  dip  the  tip  of  his  finger  in  water,  and  cool  my  tongue ; for 
I am  tormented  in  this  flame. 

25  But  Abraham  said,  Son,  remember  that  thou  in  thy  lifetime  receivedst  thy 
good  things,  and  likewise  Lazarus  evil  things : but  now  he  is  comforted,  and  thou 
art  tormented. 

26  And  beside  all  this,  between  us  and  you  there  is  a great  gulf  fixed  : so  that 
they  which  would  pass  from  hence  to  you  cannot ; neither  can  they  pass  to  us, 
that  would  come  from  thence. 

27  Then  he  said,  I pray  thee  therefore,  father,  that  thou  wouldest  send  him  to 
my  father's  house : 

28  For  I have  five  brethren ; that  he  may  testify  unto  them,  lest  they  also  come 
into  this  place  of  torment 

29  Abraham  saith  unto  him.  They  have  Moses  and  the  prophets ; let  them 
hear  them. 

30  And  he  said,  Nay,  father  Abraham : but  if  one  went  unto  them  from  the 
dead,  they  will  repent. 

31  And  he  said  unto  him,  If  they  hear  not  Moses  and  the  prophets,  neither  will 
they  be  persuaded,  though  one  arose  from  the  dead. 

Ver.  1. — And  He  said  also  unto  His  disciples , There  was  a certain 
rich  man,  which  had  a steward ; and  the  same  was  accused  unto  him 
that  he  had  wasted  his  goods.  Having  rebuked  in  three  parables 
those  who  murmured  because  He  received  penitents,  Christ  now 
adds  a fourth  and  fifth  on  almsgiving  and  frugality,  for  the  proud 
and  avaricious  Pharisees  refused  both  pardon  to  the  penitent,  and 
relief  to  those  who  were  in  want  Gloss.

master's  property,  and  was  answerable  for  the  letting  of  his 
land. 

Hence  we  learn  “ that  we  are  not  masters  of  what  we  possess, 
but  rather  stewards  of  that  which  is  another's."  S.  Ambrose  and 
Theophylact 

For  although  as  regards  men  we  are  the  absolute  masters  of  our 
own  possessions,  yet  with  respect  to  God,  who  is  Lord  over  all,  we 
are  but  stewards.  Because,  whatever  we  possess  was  given  us  for 
our  own  moderate  use  and  for  the  relief  of  our  poorer  brethren,  and 
in  the  day  of  judgment  we  shall  have  to  render  a strict  account  of 
our  stewardship. 

So  S.  Paul  says,  “ Let  a man  so  account  of  us,  as  of  the  ministers 
of  Christ  and  stewards  of  the  mysteries  of  God.  Moreover,  it  is 
required  in  stewards,  that  a man  be  found  faithful."  i Cor.  iv.  2. 
For  all  our  gifts  and  endowments  are  not  our  own,  but  belong  to 
God  who  gave  them.  Hence  we  are  bound  to  use  them  not  for  our 
own  pleasure,  but  according  to  His  wilL  Thou  hast  genius,  a keen 
judgment,  a retentive  memory,  wisdom,  eloquence,  or  the  like ! 
Forget  not  that  thou  art  a steward  of  these  gifts,  not  a master. 
Remember  that  thou  hast  to  give  an  account  of  their  use,  and  take 
heed  to  use  them  to  the  honour  and  glory  of  God.  Hear  S.  Chry- 
sostom, “There  is  an  erroneous  opinion  that  all  the  good  things 
of  this  life  which  we  possess  are  our  own,  and  that  we  are  lords  over 
them.  But  we  are  as  it  were  guests  and  strangers,  whose  departure 
draweth  nigh,  and  dispensers  of  another's  bounty.  We  ought 
therefore  to  assume  the  humility  and  modesty  of  a steward,  for 
nothing  is  our  own,  but  all  things  are  the  gift  of  God." 

Was  accused , denounced,  Arabic.  Hence  the  devil 

drajfoXtf,  is  called  the  “accuser"  (Rev.  xii.  10),  because  he  accuses 
us  before  God.  “We  are  accused,”  says  the  Interlinear,  “not 
only  when  we  do  evil,  but  when  we  omit  to  do  good.”  For  a 
steward  ought  to  omit  nothing  which  concerns  his  own  duty  or  his 
master’s  good.

of  thy  stewardship , Le.  of  how  much  thou  hast  received  and  how 
thou  hast  expended  it,  for  thou  mayest  be  no  longer  steward. 

So  Christ  saith  unto  every  one  in  the -hour  of  death,  “Give  an 
account  of  thy  stewardship.  Give  an  account  of  thy  life,  of  thy 
goods,  and  of  thy  talents,  whether  thou  hast  used  them  to  promote 
the  glory  of  God  and  the  salvation  of  thyself  and  thy  fellow-men.” 

Climacus  relates  that  a monk,  who  was  afterwards  abbot,  saw 
in  a dream,  the  first  night  he  entered  the  monastery,  certain  men 
who  demanded  of  him  the  payment  of  one  hundred  pounds  of  gold. 
Whereupon  for  the  space  of  three  years  he  gave  himself  up  to 
obedience  and  mortification,  and  at  the  end  of  that  time  was  told 
that  ten  pounds  had  been  subtracted  from  his  debt.  For  thirteen 
years  longer  he  continued  to  practise  still  greater  austerities,  and 
then  messengers  were  sent  from  God  to  say  that  all  his  debt  was 
forgiven.  The  same  writer  has  also  something  terrible  to  say 
about  the  abbot  Stephen,  who  had  for  forty  years  lived  a holy 
life  of  fasting  and  prayer.  This  man,  the  day  before  he  died,  fell 
into  a trance,  and  was  heard  as  if  in  colloquy  with  an  unseen  judge, 
denying  at  one  time  the  accusations  against  him,  at  another  time 
pleading  guilty  to  the  charges,  and  praying  for  mercy.  Terrible 
indeed  was  the  spectacle  of  this  invisible  and  stem  judgment. 

Ver.  3. — Then  the  steward  said  within  himself  What  shall  I dot 
The  steward  acknowledges  the  justice  of  the  accusation.  He  had 
wasted  his  masters  goods,  henceforward  he  must  labour  or  beg 
for  his  living.  The  one  thing  he  was  unable,  and  the  other  he 
was  ashamed  to  do.  In  his  distress,  he  knows  not  which  way  to 
turn.  Truly,  St  Chrysostom  says,  “A  slothful  life  is  powerless 
in  action.”  Symbolically,  when  life  is  past,  no  compunction  can, 
as  it  were  by  digging,  prepare  the  soul  for  fruit;  whilst  to  beg, 
after  the  manner  of  the  foolish  virgins,  is  not  only  disturbing,  but 
vain  and  useless.  Gloss. 

Ver.  4. — / am  resolved  what  to  do , &c.  I will  give  each  one  of 
my  lord’s  debtors  a bond  to  show  that  they  owe  less  than  they  are 
actually  indebted,  so  that  in  return  for  my  kindness  and  dishonestyf 
they  may  entertain  me  when  I am  deprived  of  my  stewardship.

THE  UNJUST  STEWARD'S  STRATAGEM  COMMENDED.  393 

Vers,  s and  6. — How  much  owest  thou  unto  my  Lord  t And  he  said, 
an  hundred  measures  of  oil . Greek  (3aroe  in  the  Vulgate  cadus,  the 
tenth  part  of  an  homer.  Levit.  xxvii.  16,  and  Ezek.  xlv.  11. 

And  he  said  unto  him , Take  thy  bill,  and  sit  down  quickly , and 
write  fourscore . Greek  y^ap/ta,  i.e.  “ cautio  ” or  bond,  or  as  the 
Vulgate  renders  it  “ obligatio.”  The  meaning  is,  “ Take  back  thy 
bond,  wherein  thou  didst  acknowledge  that  thou  owest  one  hundred 
measures  of  oil  Tear  it  up  and  write  another,  confessing  to  a debt 
of  fifty  only,  and  divide  the  other  fifty  between  me  and  thee/ 

Ver.  7. — Then  said  he  to  another } And  how  much  owest  thou  t 
And  he  said , An  hundred  measures  of  wheat , And  he  said  unto  him , 
Take  thy  bill,  and  write  fourscore , The  xog»f  which  was  the  same 
size  as  the  homer,  contained  ten  ephahs.  See  Ezek.  xlv.  1 1. 

“To  me,”  says  S.  Augustine  (Quasi, Evang,  Lib . ii.  34),  “ the  mean- 
ing of  the  passage  seems  this ; that  whatever  the  Jews  do  for  the 
priests  and  Levites,  should  be  more  liberally  provided  for  in  the 
Church ; that  whereas  they  give  a tenth,  Christians  should  give  a 
half,  as  Zaccheus  gave,  not  of  his  crops,  but  of  his  goods ; or  at  least 
that  they  should  give  two  tenths,  and  thus  exceed  the  payments  of 
the  Jews.” 

Ver.  8. — And  the  lord  commended  the  unjust  steward,  because  he  had 
done  wisely.  The  landlord,  not  the  Lord  Jesus,  as  Erasmus  holds. 
The  lord  praised  not  the  action,  for  it  was  dishonest,  but  the  prud- 
ence, the  cunning  craft  of  the  steward,  just  as  we  often  admire,  not 
indeed  a crime,  but  the  cleverness  shown  in  contriving  it 

The  children  of  this  world  are  in  their  generation,  i.e,  after  their 
kind,  in  worldly  matters,  or  as  Himmel  understands  it,  amongst 
their  fellow-men,  wiser  than  the  children  of  light,  ie,  than  those 
who  are  followers  of  Christ  Very  wisely  has  some  one  said,  “ In 
worldly  matters  we  are  philosophers,  as  to  our  spiritual  affairs, 
fools;  in  earthly  things  we  are  lynx-eyed,  but  in  heavenly  we  are 
moles.” 

The  children  of  this  world,  says  S.  Augustine  (Lib,  ii.  de  Genesi ) 
are  wiser  in  providing  for  their  future ; and  very  naturally  so,  because 
the  desire  of  earthly  pleasure  and  enjoyment  is  strong  in  man,  but

S.  LUKE,  C.  XVI. 


the  aspirations  of  his  soul  are  blunted  and  weakened,  partly  because 
of  the  body,  partly  from  love  of  earthly  things.  Hence  those  that 
are  led  by  the  flesh  are  more  active  and  energetic  than  those  who 
are  led  by  the  spirit,  inasmuch  as  spiritual  things,  being  invisible, 
produce  but  little  effect  on  the  minds  of  men. 

The  parable  was  directed  against  the  avarice  of  the  Pharisees. 
We  are  taught  by  it  to  use  our  riches  not  for  our  own  selfish  ends, 
but  for  the  relief  of  our  poorer  brethren.  For  Christ  bids  us  all 
remember  that  we  are  but  stewards  of  God's  good  gifts,  and  there- 
fore bound  to  use  them  so  that  we  may  give  a good  account  of  our 
stewardship,  and  obtain  our  due  reward.  In  this  sense  the  unjust 
steward  is  held  up  as  an  example,  and  not  because  of  his  injustice 
and  fraud. 

Hence  S.  Augustine,  as  already  referred  to,  considers  that  Christ 
reasons  thus,  “ If  this  steward  could  so  wisely  provide  for  this  life, 
much  more  ought  we  to  be  solicitous  for  the  life  to  come.”  And 
again,  “ If  this  steward,  unjust  as  he  proved  himself  to  be,  was  praised 
for  his  wisdom,  much  more  shall  we  receive  praise  of  God,  if  by  our 
almsgiving  we  injure  none,  but  benefit  many.”  And  he  goes  on  to 
say,  u If  a wrongdoer  received  praise  from  his  lord,  how  much  more 
pleasing  are  they  to  the  Lord  God,  who  do  all  in  accordance  with 
His  will.  So  from  the  parable  of  the  unjust  judge  Christ  took  occa- 
sion to  speak  of  God  as  judge,  although  between  the  two  no  com- 
parison was  possible.” 

We  learn  then  from  this  parable  (i.)  That  those  who  are  possessed 
of  riches,  or  any  other  gift  of  God,  such  as  health,  intellect,  and  the 
like,  are  but  stewards  of  His  bounty.  (2.)  That  every  one  is  bound 
to  use  his  possessions  to  the  honour  and  glory  of  God.  (3.)  And 
that  every  one  at  the  day  of  judgment  will  have  to  give  account,  not 
only  for  the  sins  which  he  has  committed,  but  also  for  duties  which 
he  has  neglected  to  perform.  Such  is  the  general  meaning  of  the 
parable.  Its  particular  application  I will  proceed  to  explain. 

Ver.  9.  And  (in  like  manner)  I say  unto  you,  Make  to  yourselves 
friends  of  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness . Ye  have  heard  how  the 
unjust  steward  made  his  lord's  debtors  so  kindly  disposed  towards

THE  LESSON  TAUGHT  BY  THE  PARABLE.

him,  that  when  he  was  deprived  of  his  stewardship,  they  were  willing 
to  receive  him  into  their  houses.  In  like  manner  take  heed  that  ye, 
who  have  wasted  your  lord’s  goods  through  your  misuse  of  them,  by 
the  mammon  or  the  riches  of  unrighteousness — not  by  robbery  and 
fraud,  but  in  another  sense  which  I will  soon  explain — give  to 
the  poor,  so  that  after  this  life  is  over,  they  may  receive  you  into 
everlasting  habitations. 

Here  note  that  the  word  unrighteousness  has  a double  significa- 
tion. In  the  case  of  the  steward  it  meant  dishonesty  and  deceit : 
in  our  case  it  has  a different  meaning,  as  I shall  proceed  to  show. 

Make  to  yourselves  friends  of  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness,  Le.  of 
riches,  which  are  “ unrighteous  ” in  a fourfold  sense  and  from  a four- 
fold cause. 

1.  Because  riches  are  often  amassed  through  unrighteousness,  ie. 
through  fraud,  usury,  and  the  like  of  oneself  or  one’s  ancestors. 
Hence  S.  Jerome  (Ep.  150)  says  every  rich  man  is  either  himself 
unrighteous  or  else  the  heir  of  an  unrighteous  man,  and  although  he 
may  not  be  ignorant  of  the  evil-doings  of  his  ancestors,  yet  he  can 
scarcely  be  expected  to  know  to  whom  restitution  should  be  made. 
Therefore  he  is  bound  to  make  such  restitution  as  lies  in  his  power, 
by  giving  to  the  poor.  And  commenting  on  S.  Matt.  vi.  the  same 
Father  goes  on  to  say,  Riches  are  called  Mammon  because  they  are 
acquired  through  unrighteousness,  taking  mammon  to  be  derived 
from  ]D}  min,  and  H3D,  mona,  i.e.  violence,  from  the  root  iana, 
the  meaning  being  “ to  exercise  force.”  But  the  real  derivation  seems 
to  be  from  ]DD  taman,  to  hide  or  conceal ; for  riches  and  money 
are  wont  to  be  hidden. 

2.  They  are  unrighteous  in  the  sense  of  faithless  and  deceptive, 
for  they  are  not  to  be  depended  upon,  but  often  desert  one  man 
and  pass  on  to  another. 

3.  They  are  called  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness,  because  in 
their  endeavour  to  become  rich  men  are  guilty  of  fraud,  dishonesty, 
unrighteous  dealing,  and  every  kind  of  sin. 

4.  And  again,  they  are  unrighteous,  because  wicked  and  ungodly 
men  esteem  them  of  more  value  than  the  heavenly  treasures.  S.

S.  LUKE,  c.  XVI. 


Augustine  {serm.  35  De  Verbis  Domini.)  Hence  we  may  understand 
Christ  as  saying,  “Ye  rich  and  avaricious  men  have  made  money 
your  god,  but  be  ye  well  assured  that  it  is  unrighteous,  ue.  vain  and 
deceptive.  Break  up  your  idol,  therefore,  and  give  to  the  poor,  and 
God  will  recompense  you  with  eternal  riches.”  See  S.  Matt  vi  24. 

That  when  ye  fail \ when  life  is  over  and  your  riches  are  no  longer 
at  your  disposal,  or  according  to  the  Syriac  version,  when  it,  a* 
mammon,  fails  you. 

They  may  receive  you.  The  poor,  ie.  those  whom  you  have  made 
your  friends  by  the  right  use  of  your  riches.  For  they,  if  they  are 
worthy  of  heaven,  will  by  their  prayers  and  by  a communication  of 
their  merits  make  a way  for  you  to  enter  therein : but  if,  on  the 
contrary,  they  are  unworthy  of  so  great  a blessing,  you  will  be  received 
into  heaven  because  of  your  almsgiving,  for  what  is  given  to  the 
poor  is  accepted  of  Christ 

Christ  seems  here  to  be  speaking  of  the  poor  who  lead  godly 
lives,  who  are  poor  as  far  as  earthly  possessions  are  concerned,  but 
rich  in  understanding  and  in  spiritual  grace.  Let  not  the  rich  then 
think  that  they  are  conferring,  but  rather  that  they  are  receiving 
benefits  from  such  as  these,  for  they  give  gold,  to  receive  in  return 
heaven.  Hence  S.  Gregory  (Moral  xxiL  14)  says,  “ Almsgiving  is  not 
so  much  the  relieving  the  necessities  of  the  poor  as  the  offering  of  gifts 
to  those  who  hereafter  will  receive  us  into  everlasting  habitations.” 

Learn  therefore,  that  heaven  is  the  inheritance  of  the  poor,  not  for 
their  own  possession,  but  rather  that  they  may  introduce  therein 
those  who  have  been  their  benefactors.  They  are  therefore  the 
door-keepers  of  heaven,  for  “ Blessed  are  the  poor  in  spirit,  for  theirs 
is  the  kingdom  of  heaven  ” (see  S.  Matt  v.  3),  and  this  their  blessed- 
ness is  not  of  their  own  deserving,  but  the  special  gift  of  God.  So 
S.  Augustine  {lib.  il  q.  38  Qucest.  Evang.)  says,  “They  receive  them 
not  as  of  right  but  by  the  permission  of  Him  who  counselled  them  to 
make  themselves  friends,  and  who  deigns  to  look  upon  Himself  as 
being  fed,  clothed,  entertained  and  visited  in  the  parson  of  the  least 
of  His  followers.” 

“Everlasting  habitations,”  says  Theophylact,  “are  in  Christ

FAITHFUL  WITH  LITTLE,  TRUSTED  WITH  MUCH.  397 


ordained  for  the  poor,  wherein  they  may  receive  those  who  have 
given  them  liberal  alms  out  of  that  which  God  has  committed  to 
their  trust.”  Happy  indeed  is  the  exchange,  for  earthly  things 
become  heavenly.  “ Hence  almsgiving  is  the  roost  skilful  of  arts, 
for  it  does  not  build  us  an  earthly  tabernacle,  but  provides  us  with 
eternal  life.”  S.  Chrysostom. 

Ver.  ia — He  that  is  faithful  in  that  which  is  least  is  faithful  also  in 
much . By  “that  which  is  least”  we  must  understand  earthly  posses- 
sions as  distinguished  from  the  “ much  ” of  spiritual  gifts.  That  ye 
may  not  be  deprived  of  your  heavenly  stewardship,  or  rather  that  ye 
may  be  entrusted  therewith,  take  heed  rightly  to  administer  your 
temporal  affairs,  and  especially  to  give  alms  to  the  poor,  according 
to  the  purpose  of  God.  For  so  Christ  explains  His  words  in  the 
next  verse.  In  a similar  sense  S.  Paul  writes,  “ If  a man  know  not 
how  to  rule  his  own  house,  how  shall  he  take  care  of  the  church  of 
God?”  (1  Tim.  iil  5.)  Christ  seems  here  to  be  reproaching  the 
Pharisees  with  unfaithfulness  in  the  disposal  of  their  riches,  and  in 
the  interpretation  of  the  law,  and  also  with  being  little  worthy  of 
the  position  they  held  (see  S.  Matt  v.  and  xxiii.),  for  from  ver.  14 
it  is  clear  that  these  things  were  spoken  against  them. 

Ver.  11. — If  therefore,  ye  have  not  been  faithful  in  the  unrighteous 
mammon , who  will  commit  to  your  trust  the  true  riches  t If  ye 
have  made  a wrong  use  of  this  world’s  fleeting  possessions  (1  Tim. 
vL  7),  who  will  entrust  to  your  care  the  things  which  are  lasting, 
and  which  pertain  unto  the  kingdom  of  God?  Theophylact  and 
many  others. 

Ver.  12. — And  if  ye  have  not  been  faithful  in  that  which  is  another 
man's,  who  shall  give  you  that  which  is  your  own  9 The  wording  of 
this  verse  is  different,  but  the  sense  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  pre- 
ceding. The  mammon  which  in  the  verse  above  Christ  called 
unrighteous,  he  here  calls  “another  man’s.”  For  temporal  posses- 
sions are  another’s : 

1.  Because  they  are  in  their  nature  totally  different  from  the 
nature  of  man.  They  are  of  the  earth,  given  to  man  for  his  use  in 
this  life,  to  revert  again  to  the  earth  after  death.

2.  They  are  another's  as  regards  God,  for  we  are  not  absolute 
masters  of  what  we  possess  but  administrators  only,  bound  to  dispose 
of  our  goods  according  to  His  will.  So  Titus  says,  44  He  describe? 
much  riches  as  that  which  is  another  man’s,  because  to  abound  in 
riches  is,  considering  human  nature,  foreign  to  men.  For  if  any 
man  possesses  them,  they  are  external  to  him,  and  as  it  were,  an 
accident”  41  They  are,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  44  foreign  to  the  nature 
of  man,  for  they  have  no  continuance,  they  were  neither  bom  with 
us,  nor  can  they  follow  us  when  we  die.”  S.  Augustine  also  ( Quasi L 
Evang.  ii.  35)  44  He  calls  earthly  endowments  another’s,  for  no 
man  can  carry  them  away  with  him  at  his  death.”  44  We  brought 
nothing  into  this  world,  and  it  is  certain  we  can  carry  nothing  out” 
(1  Tim.  vl  7) ; and  Euthymius  : 44  Earthly  riches  are  called  another’s 
for  they  do  not  remain  long  with  their  possessor.” 

Christ  reproves  avarice,  and  shows  that  he  who  loves  money 
cannot  love  God : therefore  the  Apostles,  if  they  would  love  Him, 
must  despise  riches.  S.  Jerome.  But  the  better  interpretation 
is  one  which  I am  about  to  give. 

That  which  is  your  own.  44  Christ  calls  heavenly  riches  ours  ” 
says  Euthymius, 44  because,  as  Theophylact  explains, 4 our  citizenship 
is  in  heaven.’  For  man  was  created  in  the  image  of  God,  but  wealth 
and  earthly  possessions  are  not  ours,  for  there  is  nothing  divine 
therein.  But  to  enjoy  divine  blessings,  and  to  partake  in  the 
nature  of  God,  is  ours.” 

But  you  will  say,  Men  are  wont  to  value  that  which  is  their  own, 
more  than  that  which  is  the  property  of  another.  Why  then  does 
Christ  here  imply  the  contrary  ? 

I answer  that  the  force  of  our  Lord’s  argument  is  seen : 1.  If  we 
look  to  the  meaning  of  the  parable,  If  ye  have  not  been  faithful  in 
earthly  things,  how  will  ye  be  so  in  heavenly,  and  who  will  dare  to 
commit  such  things  to  your  trust  ? and  2.  From  the  parable  itsell 
Men  are  as  a rule  more  careful  in  their  management  of  the  affairs  of 
others  than  of  their  own,  for  many  reasons,  but  chiefly  because  they 
are  bound  in  justice  to  make  good  any  losses  which  may  have 
been  incurred  by  their  carelessness,  and  if  careless  may  even  be

suspected  of  dishonesty  or  theft  ; whereas  for  their  own  losses,  or  for 
the  mismanagement  of  their  own  concerns,  they  are  responsible  to 
no  one. 

True,  therefore,  is  the  argument  of  Christ,  If  ye  have  not  been 
faithful  in  earthly  things,  which  are  another’s,  God  will  not  give  you 
those  heavenly  treasures  which  are  rightly  your  own.  For  he  who 
makes  a wrong  use  of  that  which  belongs  to  another  deserves  to 
lose  that  which  is  his  own.  For,  as  Dionysius  (Denis)  the  Car- 
thusian astutely  remarks,  “ In  the  former  verse,  Christ  spoke  of  the 
good  things  of  this  life,  ‘who  will  trust,  or  commit,’  because  an 
account  will  have  to  be  rendered  of  their  use.  But  of  the  good 
things  of  the  heavenly  country,  he  says,  ‘who  will  give/  for  we 
shall  not  be  called  upon  to  account  for  these,  because  once  given 
they  are  everlastingly  our  own.” 

For  the  following  verse,  see  S.  Matt,  vi.  24. 

Ver.  14. — And  the  Pharisees  also  derided  Him , i/wxrfytfyv,  “ turned 
up  their  noses,”  sneered  at  Him. 

Ver.  15. — And  He  said  unto  them9  Ye  are  they  which  justify  your- 
selves before  men9  i.e.  make  outwardly  a show  of  justice,  whereas  God 
knoweth  your  hearts  to  be  full  of  all  uncleanness.  For  that  which  is 
highly  esteemed  among  men  is  abomination  in  the  sight  of  God. 

Your  pretended  zeal  for  the  service  of  God,  which  is  held  in 
admiration  of  the  common  people,  is  hateful  to  Him  who  seeth  the 
foulness  and  corruption  of  your  hearts.  For  my  explanation  of 
verses  16  to  19,  see  S.  Matt  xL  12 ; v.  18 ; and  xix.  9. 

Ver.  19. — There  was  a certain  rich  man . You  ask,  Is  this  a par- 
able or  a true  history  ? I answer,  A history  1 

1.  Because  Christ  does  not  call  it  a parable. 

2.  Because  the  poor  man  is  named  Lazarus,  and  the  rich  man, 
according  to  a Hebrew  tradition  quoted  bv  Euthymius,  is  called  a 
native  of  Nice, 

3.  Because  the  torments  of  the  rich  man  are  related  as  an  actual 
reality. 

4.  Because  in  memory  of  Lazarus  many  hospitals  for  those  suffer- 
ing from  leprosy  and  such  like  diseases  are  called  by  his  name.

5.  Because  with  the  exception  *of  Justin,  Theophylact,  and 
Eucherius,  all  the  Fathers  are  of  my  opinion. 

Euthymius  infers  from  the  mention  made  of  Abraham  and  Moses, 
in  verses  24  and  31,  that  this  rich  man  was  a Jew,  and  mentions  a 
Hebrew  tradition  to  the  effect  that  he  was  living  ill  the  time  of 
Christ,  who  gave  his  history  as  that  of  a well-known  man,  in  order 
the  more  to  impress  his  hearers,  and  to  teach  them  to  despise  the 
good  things  of  this  present  life. 

Was  clothed  in  purple  and  in  fine  linen.  The  one  denoting  luxury 
and  pride,  and  other  softness  and  effeminacy.  There  are  some,  says 
S.  Gregory,  who  do  not  think  that  extravagance  in  apparel  is  a sin. 
But  if  it  were  not  so,  the  Word  of  God  would  not  have  so  directly 
stated  that  Dives,  who  was  tormented  in  hell,  had  been  clothed  in 
purple  and  fine  linen.  No  one  seeks  fine  clothing  but  out  of  vain- 
glory, in  order  to  appear  better  than  his  fellow-men. 

And  fared  sumptuously  every  day . The  Greek  signifies 

both  gladness  and  feasting.  So  Dives,  not  content  with  the  richness 
of  his  banquet,  sought  to  add  to  the  pleasures  of  the  feast  the 
delights  of  music,  dancing,  and  whatever  else  could  add  to  his  enjoy- 
ment Forgetful  of  the  future,  perhaps  not  believing  that  there  was 
any  future  at  all,  he  lived  without  God,  a follower  of  him  who  bids 
men  “eat,  drink,  and  enjoy  themselves,  for  death  makes  an  end  of 
all  delights.”  He  lived  as  they  live  who  “ take  the  timbrel  and  harp, 
and  rejoice  at  the  sound  of  the  organ.  They  spend  their  days  in 
wealth,  and  in  a moment  go  down  to  the  grave  ” (Job  xxi.  12,  13). 

Hence  S.  Gregory  teaches  that  we  cannot  indulge  in  revelling 
without  sin.  For  when  the  body  is  given  up  to  the  enjoyment  of 
the  feast,  the  heart  is  led  away  to  empty  rejoicing.  As  it  is  written, 
“The  people  sat  down  to  eat  and  drink,  and  rose  up  to  play” 
(Exod.  xxxiL  6). 

Conversation  generally  follows  after  a feast,  for  when  the  appetite 
is  satisfied,  the  tongue  is  let  loose.  Hence  Dives  is  fitly  described 
as  desiring  water  to  cool  his  tongue,  for  feasting  ministers  to  gluttony, 
wantonness,  pride,  evil  speaking,  envy,  and  many  other  vices. 

Ver.  so. — And  there  was  a certain  beggar,  a poor  man,  according

THE  BEGGAR'S  MISERY.  46 1 

to  the  Arabic.  A beggar,  poor  in  earthly  possessions,  but  rich  in 
virtues  and  in  patience ; named  Lazarus. 

“ The  mention  of  the  name,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ shows  this  to  be 
a narrative,  not  a parable ; ” and  S.  Cyril  tells  us,  “ that  according  to 
the  tradition  of  the  Jews,  there  was  at  that  time  a certain  poor  man  at 
Jerusalem,  by  name  Lazarus,  apparently  so  called  because  he  was  laid 
at  the  rich  man's  gate  to  pray  for  the  help  which  he  needed  so  much.” 

For  Lazarus  is  in  Hebrew  laazar,  “ ad  adjuvandum.”  Hence 
S.  Chrysostom  and  Augustine  explain  the  name  as  meaning  helped, 
or  rather  one  that  ought  to  be  helped,  for  Lazarus,  by  drawing 
attention  to  his  sores,  as  good  as  exclaimed,  ye  see  ray  misery,  help 
me  in  my  wretchedness. 

Was  laid.  fjSijSXijr©,  was  placed  by  bearers  at  the  gates  of  the 
rich  or  the  entrances  of  the  temples  as  a breathing  corpse,  bereft  of 
the  power  of  motion.  “ He.  lay,”  says  Titus,  “ each  day  and  every 
day  in  abject  misery,  neglected,  counted  as  nothing,  uncared  for,  and 
unprotected.”  “ So  that,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ the  rich  man,  as  he 
went  out  and  as  he  came  in,  could  look  upon  him,  and  see  his 
miserable  state.”  " By  which  things,”  as  S.  Gregory  teaches  ( Horn . 
40),  “ our  Lord  has  explained  His  two  judgments,  the  greater  con- 
demnation of  the  unpitying  Dives,  and  the  greater  acceptance  and 
reward  of  the  suffering  Lazarus.  For  how  great,”  he  asks,  “ do  ye 
suppose  were  the  temptations  which  the  poor  and  suffering  beggar 
had  to  resist,  when  hungry  and  diseased  he  saw  the  rich  man  enjoy- 
ing health  and  the  delights  of  life  ? When  overcome  by  pain  and 
cold,  he  beheld  him  clothed  in  purple  and  fine  linen  and  rejoicing 
in  the  good  things  of  this  life.  When  brought  low  by  the  nature 
of  his  ailment,  and  in  need,  he  saw  him  in  full  prosperity,  yet 
regardless  of  another's  wants.  What  a storm  of  temptation,  may 
we,  my  brethren,  think  there  must  have  been  in  the  heart  of  the 
beggar,  to  whom  either  ill — poverty  or  sickness,  alone  would  have 
been  a sufficient  punishment ! But  that  he  might  be  the  more  tried, 
he  was  subjected  to  both  evils,  and  saw,  moreover,  that  whilst  the 
rich  man  was  surrounded  by  flattering  friends  and  supporters,  he 

had  no  one  to  visit  him  in  his  misery  and  want.”

Full  of  sores.  Not  only  poor  but  diseased  i/Xxw/umwc,  covered 
with  ulcers.  Hence  many  think  that  Lazarus  was  a leper,  and 
therefore  look  upon  him  as  the  patron  saint  of  those  afflicted  with 
leprosy,  who  are  called  Lazars,  and  their  hospitals  Lazarettos,  after 
his  name. 

Ver.  21. — And  dogs  came  and  licked  his  sores.  Francis  Lucas 
thinks  that  they  did  this  as  if  feeding  on  a dead  body,  and  that  they 
thus  caused  the  poor  sufferer  much  pain,  for,  S.  Chrysostom  adds, 
M he  had  not  the  strength  to  drive  them  away.” 

But  in  another  sense  the  dogs  may  be  considered  as  cleansing 
and  healing  the  poor  man’s  sores.  Hence  S.  Chrysostom  says, 
“The  wild  animals  in  compassion  lick  the  sores  which  no  one, 
much  less  the  rich  glutton,  cared  to  cleanse.  For  the  rich,  unmind- 
ful of  the  condition  of  their  fellowmen,  laugh  at  misery,  and  turn 
away  from  those  whom  they  ought  to  pity.”  S.  Ambrose. 

S.  Chrysostom  {hom.  De  Lazaro ),  enumerates  nine  grievous  ills 
to  which  the  poor  man  was  subjected : 

1.  A poverty  so  extreme,  that  he  could  not  even  obtain  the  crumbs 
which  fell  from  the  rich  man’s  table. 

2.  A disease  so  grievous  and  so  weakening,  that  he  was  unable 
to  drive  away  the  dogs  which  gathered  round  him. 

3.  Desertion  by  all,  even  those  who  ought  to  have  aided  him. 

4.  The  constant  sight  of  the  rich  man’s  happiness,  for  his  bodily 
pains  and  his  grief  of  mind  were  increased  by  the  knowledge,  that 
they  who  were  possessed  of  every  enjoyment  had  no  thought  or 
consideration  for  him. 

5.  The  hard-heartedness  of  the  rich  man,  who  passed  him  by, 
without  a kind  word  or  look. 

6.  His  loneliness,  for  “it  is  pleasant  to  have  a companion  in 
misfortunes.’' 

7.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  future,  for  since  the  coming  of  Christ, 
faith  in  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  is  a wonderful  support  in 
affliction. 

8.  The  long  continuance  and  constancy  of  his  sufferings. 

9.  The  loss  of  reputation,  for  many  thought  that  his  sufferings  were

a direct  punishment  for  some  great  crime.  But,  like  another  Joby 
he  bore  all  his  trials  with  fortitude  and  an  undaunted  mind.  Hence, 
God  has  set  forth  Lazarus,  Job,  Tobias  and  S.  Lydwina,  whose 
sufferings  are  recorded  by  Sirius,  to  be  as  long  as  the  world  lasts 
examples  of  patience  to  all  who  are  sick  and  afflicted. 

Ver.  22. — And  it  came  to  pass  that  the  beggar  died , of  disease, 
misery,  and  want. 

And  was  carried^  i.e.  his  soul  was  conducted  with  honour,  for  the 
soul  after  death  needs  no  actual  carrying.  Observe  here  the  office  of 
the  angels ; for  S.  Chrysostom  says,  if  we  need  guides,  when  we  are 
changing  from  one  country  to  another,  how  much  more  shall  we 
need  some  to  lead  the  way  when  the  disembodied  soul  is  on  its 
passage  to  futurity.  He  further  adds,  u Ye  saw  the  poor  man  at  the 
rich  man’s  gate : ye  see  him  now  in  Abraham’s  bosom ; ye  saw  him  sur- 
rounded by  dogs : ye  see  him  in  company  of  the  angels ; ye  saw  him 
poor,  famished,  struggling : ye  see  him  happy,  filled  with  good  things,  and 
possessed  of  the  prize.  Ye  saw  his  labours : ye  see  his  reward.” 

Into  Abraham's  bosom . In  order  that,  beholding  Lazarus  enter- 
tained as  a guest  by  Abraham,  the  rich  man  might  be  confounded 
at  his  own  want  of  hospitality.  Euthymius.  Abraham  was  hospi- 
table : that  the  sight  of  Lazarus  might  rebuke  the  rich  man’s  want 
of  hospitality.  Abraham  was  wont  to  watch  for  wayfarers,  to  bring 
them  to  his  house ; but  the  rich  man  tfespised  him  who  lay  within 
his  gate,  and  though  the  poor  man  was  daily  ready  to  his  hand,  he 
used  him  not  as  a treasure  by  means  of  which  he  might  obtain 
salvation.  S.  Chrysostom  (horn,  De  Lazaro.) 

You  ask,  What  is  Abraham’s  bosom,  and  where  situated?  S. 
Augustine  (lib,  iv.  De  Anima)  replies,  “ It  is  the  place  of  rest  in  which 
are  received  after  death  the  souls  of  all  who  are  imitators  of  the 
faith  and  piety  of  Abraham.  The  place  which  before  Christ  was 
the  * limbus  patrum,’  but  now  is  heaven,  the  paradise  of  the  blessed. 
Hence  the  Church  sings,  “ Martin  rejoices  in  Abraham’s  bosom — 
Martin,  here  poor  and  mean,  enters  heaven  abounding  in  wealth.” 

And  S.  Augustine,  treating  of  the  death  of  Nebridius  (Confess, 
lib,  ix.)  says,  “ He  lives  in  Abraham’s  bosom,  wherever  that  may  be,

there  my  Nebridius  lives.”  And  the  Church  prays  that  God  will 
receive  the  souls  of  the  departed  in  Abraham’s  bosom,  and  give 
them  eternal  rest,  “ as  thou  hast  promised  to  Abraham  and  his  seed 
for  ever.” 

It  is  called  Abraham’s  bosom,  i.  Because  children  rest  quiet  in 
the  bosom  of  their  parents,  and  all  the  faithful  are  called  children  of 
Abraham,  who  excelled  all  in  faith  and  holiness.  Hence  “in  the 
limbus  of  the  fathers  ” he  was  chie£ 

Abraham’s  bosom,  therefore,  says  Ambrose,  is  a certain  haven  of 
rest,  and  a sacred  retreat

S.  Augustine. 

2.  Because  this  blessedness  was  promised  to  Abraham  and  in  him 
to  all  the  faithful  Gen.  xxii.  18. 

3.  Because  Abraham  was  remarkable  for  his  hospitality.  Hence  it 
was  fitting  that  the  poor  and  friendless  Lazarus,  whom  the  inhospitable 
rich  man  had  rejected,  should  be  received  into  his  bosom.  For,  says 
Chrysologus,  the  kindness  which  he  showed  to  God  made  him  chief  of 
the  heavenly  banquet,  and  because  he  received  two  men  with  God  at 
an  earthly  feast  (Gen.  xviii.  8),  he  will  receive  the  people  of  the  East 
and  West  at  a heavenly. 

Hence  the  soul  of  the  poor  man  was  carried,  not  into  Abraham’s 
presence  only,  but  into  Abraham’s  bosom,  in  order  that  it  might 
receive  comfort  and  refreshment  S.  Chrysostom.  And  again, 
Because  Lazarus  when  on  earth,  was  poor  and  despised,  in  heaven 
he  became  honoured  and  rich.  Thus,  solely  on  account  of  the  ills 
which  he  suffered,  Lazarus  obtained  a reward  like  to  that  of  the 
Patriarch,  and  this,  not  because  he  had  had  pity  on  the  poor,  or 
had  relieved  the  oppressed,  or  had  done  some  good  thing,  but 
because  he  bore  patiently  all  the  ills  he  had  to  endure. 

The  rich  man  also  died,  and  was  buried.  “ The  man  who  had  so 
buried  his  soul  in  drunkenness  and  self-indulgence  that  it  was  useless 
and  dead  within  him,”  says  S.  Chrysostom ; who  goes  on  to  give  a 
touching  description  of  the  change  which  had  now  come  over 
Dives.  “Consider,”  he  says,  “the  pomp  in  which  he  had  lived,

the  flatterers  and  friends  which  were  wont  to  seek  his  company,  and 
the  luxury  which  had  surrounded  him : and  now  all  had  departed. 
Everywhere  nothing  but  dust  and  ashes,  lamentation  and  weeping ; 
no  one  to  help  him,  no  one  to  call  back  his  soul  Of  what  avail 
were  his  riches,  now  that  he  was  taken  away  from  all  his  dependents 
and  left  deserted,  defenceless,  and  neglected,  left  alone  to  bear  in 
his  own  person  an  intolerable  punishment  ? ” 

In  hell \ i.e  “in  purgatory,”  says  James  Faber,  who  thinks  that  the 
rich  man,  after  suffering  the  purgatorial  fires,  was  saved.  But  others 
understand  here  the  place  of  the  damned,  and  hold  that  the  rich 
man  had  received  his  condemnation,  an  interpretation  which  is 
supported  by  the  after  narrative,  particularly  by  the  26th  verse ; and 
indeed,  this  is  the  proper  signification  of  the  word  “ hell,”  which — in 
the  Greek  from  the  primative  particle  a,  and  % to  see — 
means  a place  of  darkness,  where  there  is  neither  seeing  nor  light 
But  you  will  say,  We  do  not  read  that  the  rich  man  sinned,  save 
inasmuch  as  he  fared  sumptuously  every  day,  which  as  a venial  sin 
was  deserving  of  purgatory,  but  not  of  hell 

I answer,  that  although  to  fare  sumptuously  is  a venial  sin,  yet  if 
it  leads  to  evil  and  to  excess,  especially  if  it  is  productive  of  selfish- 
ness and  a disregard  of  the  poor,  it  becomes  mortal,  and  this  must 
happen  to  him  who  is  a slave  to  his  appetite,  for  as  I have  said 
(ver.  19),  a man  cannot  at  the  same  time  serve  his  belly  and  his 
God.  The  rich  man  therefore  was  damned  on  account  of  these 
sins,  and  chiefly  because  of  his  neglect  of  Lazarus.  For  he  was 
bound,  under  peril  of  committing  mortal  sin,  to  minister  to  the  need 
of  the  poor  man,  and  since  he  did  not  do  so,  he  became  liable  to 
the  punishment  of  hell 

“For  it  is  robbery,”  says  S.  Chrysostom  “to  keep  what  we  have 
received,  and  to  refuse  to  others  a share  in  our  abundance.”  Again 
he  adds,  “the  rich  man  was  tormented,  not  because  he  was  rich,  but 
because  he  had  no  compassion.”  So  also  S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa. 

Hear  also  S.  Hieronymus  ( Epist \ 34,  ad Julianum) : “The  flames 
of  hell  received  the  purple-clad  Dives.  But  the  poor  and  suffering 
fceggar,  whose  sores  the  dogs  licked,  who  scarcely  could  maintain

himself  on  the  crumbs  which  fell  from  the  rich  man’s  table,  is  carried 
into  Abraham’s  bosom,  and  comforted  by  the  Patriarch  with  a 
parent’s  care.  For  it  is  difficult,  nay  impossible,  to  enjoy  both 
present  and  future  possessions ; to  fill  here  the  belly,  there  the  soul ; 
to  pass  from  delights  to  delights ; to  be  first  in  both  worlds,  and  to 
appear  glorious  both  in  heaven  and  on  earth.” 

Hence  S.  Basil  (serm.  i,  De  Jefunio)  says,  “ Beware  of  luxury,  for 
the  rich  roan  is  tormented,  not  because  of  his  evil  deeds,  but  because 
of  his  self-indulgent  life.”  For  they  who  are  indulgent  to  themselves 
are  harsh  and  unmerciful  to  others.  They  take  away  what  the  poor 
man  needs  to  minister  to  their  own  unnecessary  enjoyments,  as  this 
glutton  did,  not  only  from  Lazarus,  but  also  from  the  other  poor.  For, 
adds  S.  Chrysostom,  “ If  he  had  no  pity  on  him  whom  time  after  time, 
as  he  went  out  of  his  house  and  returned  to  it  again,  he  was  com- 
pelled to  see  lying  at  his  gate,  on  whom  has  he  ever  had  compassion  ? 
He  therefore  was  content  that  they  should  die  of  hunger,  cold,  and 
disease.  So  to  this  very  day  there  are  some  rich  men  who  are 
liberal  in  their  banquetings,  illiberal  to  the  poor — who  spend  pounds 
on  one  feast  alone,  but  grudge  a penny  for  the  relief  of  those  in 
want.  Thus  they  who  always  study  themselves,  neglect  others,  and 
consume  everything  on  their  own  pleasures.  For  gluttony  is  a 
master  passion  and  says,  “ All  is  for  me,  nothing  for  thee.” 

He  lift  up  his  eyes.  The  eyes  not  of  his  body,  but  of  his  mind. 
God  showed  the  rich  man  Lazarus  in  Abraham’s  bosom,  that,  says 
S.  Chrysostom,  “ he  might  be  the  more  tormented,  not  only  from  the 
nature  of  his  punishment,  but  also  from  seeing  the  estimation  in 
which  Lazarus  was  held.  For  as  the  sufferings  of  Lazarus,  when  a 
prey  to  so  many  evils,  were  increased  by  the  sight  of  the  rich  man 
abounding  in  good  things,  so  now  the  sight  of  Lazarus,  in  his  turn 
comforted,  was  to  Dives  an  increase  of  misery.”  Hence  S.  Gregory 
(hom.  40)  and  after  him  the  Gloss  says : “ We  must  believe  that 
before  the  judgment  the  wicked  see  the  just  at  rest,  and  are  tormented 
by  their  happiness,  and  also  that  the  just  behold  the  wicked  in 
torment,  that  their  joy  may  be  increased  as  they  look  upon  the 
evils  from  which  they  have  been  mercifully  preserved.”

DIVES  CRIES  TO  ABRAHAM.  407 

Ver.  24. — And  he  cried — “cried”  because  his  great  punishment 
evoked  a great  cry.  S.  Chrysostom. 

And  said,  Father  Abraham . He  calls  Abraham  father,  because 
he  was  a Jew,  and  therefore  a descendant  of  Abraham.  He  did 
not  address  Lazarus,  says  Theophylact,  because  he  was  ashamed, 
and  moreover  thought  that  Lazarus  was  still  mindful  of  the  evils  he 
had  suffered  at  his  hands. 

Send  Lazarus . “ O miserable  man,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ thou  art 
mistaken.  Abraham  can  receive  him,  he  cannot  send  him ! Behold 
the  rich  man  has  now  need  of  the  poor  man.  So  when  death  draws 
nigh,  and  the  spectacle  of  life  is  over,  when  the  marks  of  riches  and 
of  poverty  are  laid  aside,  all  are  judged  according  to  their  works, 
according  as  they  are  possessed  of  true  riches,  or  are  poor  in  the 
sight  of  God” 

And  again,  by  a sudden  change — a change  which  is  graphically 
described  by  the  prophet  (see  Isaiah  lxv.  13) — the  rich  man 
becomes  the  suppliant  of  the  poor  man,  and  he  who  was  wont  to 
pass  by  Lazarus  as  he  lay  nigh  at  hand,  invokes  his  aid  now  that 
he  is  afar  off. 

That  he  may  dip  the  tip  of  his  finger  in  water,  &c.  His  tongue, 
which  was  inflamed  with  the  desires  of  gluttony  and  of  boasting, 
says  S.  Chrysostom  (and  of  gossiping,  adds  the  Interlinear),  now 
burns  with  the  fires  of  hell,  for  wherein  that  a man  sinneth,  by  the 
same  also  shall  he  be  punished.  Wisdom  xi.  16. 

For  I am  tormented,  &c,  by  unspeakable  torments,  both  by  the 
flaming  fire  and  a raging  thirst. 

Hear  S.  Chrysostom  (serm.  124) : “ If  thou  art  surrounded  on  all 
sides  by  the  fires  of  hell,  why  dost  thou  desire  only  the  cooling  of 
thy  tongue  ? Because,  he  answers,  the  tongue  which  insulted  the 
poor  man,  and  refused  him  relief,  suffers  the  more  in  the  fiery 
torment:”  and  Salvian  adds  (Lib.  iii.  ad.  Eccles .),  “How  willingly 
would  the  rich  man  have  sacrificed  all  his  possessions  to  obtain 
release  from  his  endless  misery?”  Nay  more,  he  would  have 
given  up  everything  for  one  hour's  respite  from  the  flames. 
Because,  can  we  imagine  that  he  who  prayed  that  Lazarus  might

be  sent  so  great  a journey  to  bear  but  one  drop  of  water,  would 
have  begrudged  any  price  to  purchase  rest  ? 

“ Fitly,”  says  S.  Augustine  {serm.  no  De  1'empore)  “ did  he  ask  a 
drop  of  the  man  who  asked  of  him  a crumb,  and  inasmuch  as  he 
loved  riches,  he  met  with  no  compassion.  Ever  foolish,  too  late 
compassionate,  he  wished  his  brethren  to  be  warned — but  obtained 
nothing  by  his  request”  And  again  {Serm.  227),  “ Be  warned  by  the 
example  of  the  luxurious  rich  man,  whose  dogs  Lazarus  fed  by  his 
sores,  though  he  was  denied  the  crumbs  which  fell  from  that  rich 
man's  table.  But  after  a short  time  their  lots  were  changed.  The 
poor  man,  because  of  his  poverty,  obtained  happiness ; the  rich 
man,  on  account  of  his  riches,  punishment.  The  one  is  carried  by 
the  angels  into  Abraham’s  bosom,  the  other  consigned  to  the  depths 
of  helL  The  whole  body  of  the  rich  man  is  consumed  by  the  fire, 
yet  his  tongue  suffers  still  greater  torment.  Doubtlessly  because 
by  its  proud  speaking  he  had  despised  the  poor  man.  For  the 
tongue  which  is  unwilling  to  order  the  relief  of  the  poor,  is  sub 
jected  to  greater  suffering  hereafter.  O rich  man,  how  canst  thou 
ask  for  a drop  of  water,  when  thou  wouldest  not  give  a crumb  from 
thy  table?  Hadst  thou  been  willing  to  give,  thou  mightest  now 
with  justice  make  thy  request”  And  again,  “ By  a just  judgment 
in  thy  turn  thou  sufferest,  for  judgment  without  mercy  is  the  reward 
of  the  unmerciful” 

And  S.  Gregory  (< Horn . 40) : “ He  who  was  unwilling  to  give  the 
suffering  beggar  the  least  crumb  that  fell  from  his  table,  in  hell  was 
feign  to  seek,  if  it  were  but  the  least  drop  of  water.”  And  S.  Basil 
says,  “ The  rich  man  is  worthily  recompensed : for  the  tuneful  lyre, 
wailing ; for  drink,  the  intense  longing  for  a drop.” 

You  ask,  How  can  the  soul  of  the  rich  man  be  said  to  have  a 
tongue,  or  the  soul  of  Lazarus  a finger;  or  how  can  the  one  feel 
thirst,  and  be  tormented  in  the  flames,  or  seek  to  be  relieved  by 
the  finger  of  the  other? 

1.  Tertullian  erroneously  thinks  that  the  human  soul  is  corporeal, 
and  that  it  therefore  has  its  tongue,  finger,  and  other  members. 

2.  Hugo  (Etherianus  supposes  that  the  disembodied  soul  has  the

CONDITION  OF  THE  DAMNED.  409 

semblance  of  a body,  like  the  reflection  of  any  object  in  a mirror ; 
and  John  Huartus,  a physician,  is  of  the  same  opinion. 

3.  But  I hold  that  Christ  was  here  speaking  after  the  manner  of  a 
parable,  and  wished  to  place  before  the  eyes  of  his  hearers  the 
punishments  and  rewards  which  men  will  receive  at  the  day  of 
judgment,  because  we  only  can  form  an  opinion  of  the  punishments 
of  the  soul  through  the  punishments  of  the  body ; and  further,  he 
wished  to  show  that  the  rich  man  was  punished  suitably  to  his  sin. 

Some  add  that  the  fires  of  hell  produce  in  the  souls  of  the  damned 
torments,  similar  to  those  which  they  would  suffer  if  they  were  still 
in  the  body.  For  why  should  it  be  thought  impossible  for  God  to 
cause  the  soul  to  suffer  without  the  body  what  it  would  have 
suffered  if  it  had  continued  to  be  united  with  the  body  ? Especially 
as  every  feeling  which  affects  the  soul  whilst  it  is  in  the  body,  is  of 
the  soul,  and  not  of  the  body  : for  it  is  the  soul  and  not  the  body 
which  feels,  and  sees  and  hears.  See  2 Cor.  iv.  16.  Hence  Francis 
Lucas  says,  that  we  are  to  understand  that  the  soul  of  the  rich  man 
suffered  just  as  if  his  body  had  been  actually  given  up  to  be 
tormented  by  the  flames,  for  the  soul  is  afflicted  by  imaginations 
derived  from  the  body. 

In  short,  all  these  things  set  forth,  after  the  manner  of  a parable, 
the  extreme  misery  and  torment  of  the  rich  man ; and  also  that  the 
blessed  are  not  able  to  render  any  aid  to  the  damned,  nor  indeed 
have  they  the  wish  to  do  so,  inasmuch  as  they  are  persuaded  that 
this  would  be  contrary  to  the  fixed  purpose  of  God.  Furthermore,  the 
damned  do  not  dare  to  ask  this  aid,  for  they  on  their  part  know  that 
they  are  separated  by  a great  and  impassable  gulf  from  those  who 
have  entered  into  rest 

Hence  Abraham  feels  no  compassion  for  the  misery  of  the  rich 
man,  because  he  recognises  in  his  punishment  the  justice  of  God. 
For  the  sight  of  the  punishment  of  the  wicked  does  not  lessen  the 
happiness  of  the  just,  because  since  they  can  feel  no  compassion  for 
the  sufferings  which  they  see,  their  joy  will  not  on  this  account  be 
diminished.  Gloss.  And  S.  Gregory  ( horn, . 40)  says,  The  souls  of  the 
just,  although  in  the  goodness  of  their  nature  they  feel  compassion,

yet  after  they  have  been  united  to  the  righteousness  of  their  Authorf 
are  constrained  by  such  great  uprightness  as  not  to  be  moved 
with  compassion  towards  the  reprobate. 

Ver.  25. — But  Abraham  said , Son , remember,  &c.  “See,”  says  S. 
Chrysostom,  “the  kindness  of  the  Patriarch.  He  calls  him  son, 
yet  he  gives  no  aid  to  him,  who  had  deprived  himself  of  cure.” 
“For,”  adds  S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa,  “because  he  had  no  pity,  he  is 
not  heard.  Neither  Abraham  nor  God  has  compassion  on  his 
prayer.” 

Remember  that  thou  . . . receivedst  thy  good  things . Thou,  when 
thou  wast  faring  sumptuously,  wast  unwilling  to  bestow  a thought 
on  Lazarus,  or  on  God,  or  on  heaven  or  hell ; but  now  call  to  mind 
thy  feastings,  which  have  led  to  thy  condemnation. 

“ For,”  says  S.  Gregory  (horn.  40),  “ to  increase  his  punishment,  his 
knowledge  and  memory  are  preserved.  He  knows  Lazarus,  whom 
he  had  despised,  and  remembers  his  brethren  whom  he  had  left,  that 
by  the  sight  of  the  glory  of  one,  whom  he  had  despised,  and  by 
anxiety  about  the  punishment  of  those  whom  he  had  loved  to  no 
purpose,  he  would  be  the  more  tormented.” 

Thy  good  things.  Thine,  i.e.  earthly  things,  which  thou  didst 
consider  true  riches,  things  for  which  alone  thou  didst  live  in  utter 
neglect  of  higher  concerns.  “ Evil  men,”  says  S.  Gregory,  “ receive  in 
this  life  good  things,  for  they  consider  transitory  happiness  to  be 
their  sole  joy.” 

2.  Thine,  ue . the  reward  due  to  thy  scanty  deserts.  “ For  we  are 
taught,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ that  the  rich  man  was  rewarded  in  this 
world  for  any  good  which  he  had  done,  and  Lazarus  punished  for 
any  evil  which  he  might  have  committed.  It  follows  therefore  that 
Lazarus  was  comforted,  because  of  his  patience  and  goodness,  which 
had  not  been  regarded  in  this  life,  and  the  rich  man  tormented  because 
of  his  sin  and  neglect  of  God,  which  had  not  been  punished  in  this 
life.”  “ So,”  S.  Gregory  says,  “ the  fire  of  poverty  purged  the  poor 
man’s  sins,  and  this  world’s  fleeting  happiness  rewarded  the  rich  man 
for  any  good  which  he  had  done.” 

3.  Thine.  Thou  in  this  life  didst  receive  thy  portion  of  good.

god’s  righteous  judgments.  41 1 

therefore  there  was  nothing  in  store  for  thee  in  the  future;  but 
Lazarus  received  evil  things,  therefore  happiness  in  the  next  world 
was  his  due.  For  thus  God  in  his  justice  apportions  heavenly 
blessings  to  the  elect,  but  earthly  benefits  to  the  wicked  and  those 
who  know  Him  not  Wherefore,  let  him  who  abounds  in  earthly 
riches  and  earthly  honour,  fear  lest  he  may  be  deprived  of  them  in 
the  life  to  come : and  let  him  who  has  none  of  these  enjoyments  in 
this  world,  look  for  them  in  heaven 

This  truth  Christ  revealed  to  S.  Catherine  of  Sienna,  in  a vision 
of  which  mention  has  been  already  made.  (See  chap.  vi.  24). 

Behold  an  image  of  eternity,  the  cross  leading  to  the  crown,  but 
pleasure  to  destruction. 

On  these  words  of  Abraham,  S.  Bernard  exclaims,  “ Awake,  ye 
drunken,  and  weep,  for  God  is  fearful  in  His  judgments  on  the  sons 
of  men.  Can  it  be  that  the  rich  man  was  in  torment,  solely  because  he 
received  good  things  in  his  lifetime  ? Clearly  on  this  account  alone  1 
“ For  we  may  not  think  that  we  were  cast  out  of  paradise  because 
of  God’s  punishment  of  sin,  in  order  that  the  wit  of  men  might  pre- 
pare for  themselves  another  paradise  here  upon  earth. 

“ Man  was  bom  to  labour ; if  he  refuses  labour,  he  frustrates  the 
purpose  for  which  he  was  brought  into  the  world,  and  how  will  he 
answer  him  who  has  ordained  labour  as  the  lot  of  man?” 

He  presses  his  argument  yet  further,  and  adds,  “ What  shall  we  say 
to  this  ? If  in  the  final  judgment  misery  takes  the  place  of  rejoicing, 
are  not  ills  to  be  preferred  to  the  good  things  of  this  life?  For  it  is 
clear  that  the  one  are  not  really  good  nor  the  other  actually  evil 
The  truer  then  is  the  opinion  of  Solomon,  1 It  is  better  to  go  to  the 
house  of  mourning  than  to  the  house  of  feasting/”  Eccles.  vii.  2. 

And  likewise  Lazarus  evil  things . Sickness,  poverty,  and  its 

attendant  ills,  which  the  worldly-minded  consider  evils,  but  which 
the  followers  of  God  account  good,  inasmuch  as  they  conduce  to 
holiness  here,  and  happiness  hereafter.  S.  Thomas,  Chrysostom,  and 
others. 

But  now  he  is  comforted,  and  thou  art  tormented \ By  many  a 
misery,  which  in  thy  lifetime  thou  didst  little  regard.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XVI. 


Ver.  26. — And  beside  all  this , between  us  and  you  there  is  a great 
gulf  fixed,  (Chaos,  in  the  Vulgate).  Perhaps  the  rich  man,  as  an 
increase  to  his  torment,  was  shown  as  in  a vision  the  heavenly  abode 
of  the  blessed,  whither  Abraham  and  Lazarus  were  to  ascend  a little 
after  the  death  of  Christ. 

HearS. Cyprian  (De  Ascens.  Doml):  “The  wicked  will  for  everd well 
amidst  devouring  fire.  There  the  rich  man  will  bum  without  any 
one  to  cool  his  tongue  with  even  one  drop  of  water.  Every  evil  lust 
and  passion  will  have  its  appropriate  punishment,  and  despair  will 
add  to  the  miseries  of  the  lost  God  will  then  have  no  pity  on  the 
penitent  Too  late  will  be  their  confession,  for  when  the  door  is 
shut,  in  vain  will  those  who  are  without  oil  seek  to  enter.  From 
thence  there  is  no  release.  Christ  once  descended  into  hell ; He  will 
not  go  thither  again.  The  condemned  will  not  again  see  God  in  their 
dark  dwelling.  The  sentence  passed  will  be  irrevocable,  the  judgment 
of  condemnation  stands  changeless  and  fixed  for  all  eternity.” 

Hence  S.  Bernard  says,  “Thou  in  the  midst  of  hell  must  be 
expecting  that  salvation,  which  is  to  be  won  in  the  midst  of  our 
earthly  existence.  But  how  canst  thou  imagine  that  thou  wilt  have 
in  the  midst  of  eternal  burnings  the  power  of  obtaining  pardon,  when 
the  time  of  pardon  has  passed  away  ? There  is  no  offering  for  sin 
for  thee,  who  art  dead  in  sins.  The  Son  of  God  will  not  be  crucified 
again.  He  died,  He  does  not  die  again.  His  blood,  which  was 
poured  out  on  the  earth,  does  not  flow  down  to  hell  All  sinners 
have  drunk  thereof  on  earth.  There  is  none  which  the  devils  and 
the  wicked  who  are  their  companions  can  claim  for  the  extinguishing 
of  the  flames  which  torment  them.” 

Mystically:  S.  Ambrose,  Chrysostom,  and  Theophylact  understand 
the  gulf  to  mean  the  fixed  and  final  separation  of  the  just  and  unjust. 
See  Rev.  xxi.,  S.  Matt  v.  25. 

Hence  S.  Gregory,  and  after  him  the  Interlinear,  says,  “ Between 
Dives  and  Lazarus  there  is  a gulf,  because  after  death  no  man  can 
change  his  reward,  the  damned  cannot  exchange  lots  with  the 
blessed,  nor  the  blessed  with  those  who  are  lost” 

“The  gulf,”  says  Titus,  “indicates  the  difference  between  the  just

413 


and  unjust,  for  as  their  desires  and  wishes  were  opposed,  so  now 
their  condition  is  immutable.”  “ It  also,”  adds  S.  Augustine  (lib.  ii. 
Quasi.  Evang.\  “ shows  to  those  who  are  in  prison,  that  by 
the  unchangeableness  of  the  divine  sentence,  no  merciful  aid  can 
be  rendered  to  them  by  the  righteous,  however  much  they  may  wish 
to  give  it” 

Allegorically.  Lazarus  lying  at  the  rich  man’s  gate  represents  Christ, 
who  by  the  lowliness  of  His  Incarnation  condescended  to  the  case 
of  the  proud  Jews,  desiring  to  be  fed  with  the  crumbs  which  fell 
from  the  rich  man’s  table,  i.e.t  seeking  from  them  the  least  works 
of  righteousness,  which  at  their  own  table,  that  is,  when  they  had  it 
in  their  power,  they  were  too  proud  to  perform ; which  works, 
although  very  slight,  they  would  do,  not  out  of  the  set  purpose  of 
a good  life,  but  occasionally  and  by  chance,  like  as  crumbs  are  wont 
to  fall  from  the  table. 

The  sores  are  the  sufferings  of  our  Lord,  which  from  weakness  of 
the  flesh,  He  deigned  to  undergo  for  us.  The  dogs  are  the  Gentiles, 
accounted  by  the  Jews  sinners  and  unclean,  who  throughout  the 
world  softly  and  devoutly  lick  the  wounds  of  Christ  in  the  sacrament 
of  His  body  and  blood.  Abraham’s  bosom,  the  hidden  presence  of 
God  the  Father,  into  which  our  Lord  was  received  after  His  passion. 
Augustine  (lib.  ii.  Quasi.  Evang.)  And  again,  symbolically , he  goes 
on  to  say : “ By  the  rich  man  we  may  understand  the  proud  Jews ; 
the  purple  and  fine  linen  are  the  grandeur  of  the  kingdom ; the 
sumptuous  feasting  is  the  boasting  of  the  Law ; Lazarus,  i.e.  ‘assisted,’ 
some  Gentile  or  publican,  who  is  all  the  more  relieved,  as  he  pre- 
sumes less  on  the  abundance  of  his  resources ; the  dogs  are  those 
most  wicked  men,  who  praise  the  evil  works  which  another  groans 
over  and  detests  in  himself;  the  five  brethren  are  the  Jews,  bound 
by  the  five  books  of  the  Law.” 

In  like  manner  S.  Gregory  (Horn.  40)  says,  “ Lazarus  represents 
the  Gentile  people.  The  bursting  forth  of  his  sores  is  the  confession 
of  sin.  The  crumbs  were  denied  him,  for  the  proud  Jews  disdained 
to  admit  the  Gentiles  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Law.  The  dogs  are 
the  preachers,  who  by  their  teaching,  as  it  were,  touch  with  their

tongue  the  wounds  of  the  soul.  Abraham’s  bosom,  the  secret  rest, 
where  the  rich  man  sees  Lazarus.  For  the  unbelievers  see  the 
faithful  abiding  in  rest  above  them  but  afar  off,  because  they  cannot 
attain  thither  by  their  merits,  and  they  bum  in  their  tongues  because 
they  held  in  their  mouth  the  words  of  the  Law,  but  kept  them  not” 
And  again,  “ Lazarus  represents  an  apostolic  man,  poor  in  speech 
but  rich  in  faith.  The  crumbs  are  the  doctrines  of  the  faith.  The 
rich  man,  some  heretic  who  abounds  in  eloquent  discourses — for 
all  such  have  a talkative  tongue,  but  a foolish  and  profitless  soul” 
Ver.  27. — Then  he  said , I pray  thee>  therefore^  father , that  thou 
wouldest  send  him,  &c.  Probably  these  words  are  spoken  as  the 
former  ones,  after  the  manner  of  a parable  (see  verse  24).  For  it 
is  a very  common  occurrence  in  everyday  life  that  those  who  have 
met  with  misfortunes  wish  to  warn  their  brethren  against  incurring 
a similar  fate.  But  of  one  thing  worldly-minded  men,  who  ridicule 
or  else  think  lightly  of  the  pains  of  hell,  may  be  assured,  no  one  has 
ever  returned  from  thence  to  tell  us  what  their  sufferings  are. 

That  thou  wouldest  send  him . Lazarus  again  in  the  body,  that 
he,  being  known  to  the  brethren,  and  a witness  to  be  seen  of  all, 
might  move  them  to  faith  and  penitence.  We  are  taught  therefore 
that  the  rich  man  after  his  death  had  need  of  the  aid  of  him  whom 
in  his  lifetime  he  had  despised. 

Touching  the  appearances  of  the  spirits  of  the  departed,  see 
S.  Augustine  (De  cura pro  mortuis) ; Debrius  (in  Magicis ) ; and  Peter 
Thyrseus  (De  apparitionibus  spirituum), 

Ver.  28. — That  he  may  testify  unto  them  how  grievously  I am 
tormented  for  my  sinful  indulgence,  and  exhort  them  to  repentance 
and  amendment,  lest  they  also  come  into  this  place  of  torment. 

You  will  say,  that  the  damned  are  in  utter  despair,  hating  both 
God  and  man,  cursing  everything  and  every  creature,  and  bearing 
good  will  to  none — how  then  could  Dives  have  wished  that  his 
brethren  might  escape  the  torments  of  hell  ? I answer — 

1.  The  damned  do  not  wish  to  cause  anything  good,  ue.  any 
act  of  natural  or  supernatural  virtue,  nor  have  they  the  power  to 
do  so  on  account  of  their  despair,  and  intense  hatred  of  God  and

CONCERN  OF  DIVES  FOR  HIS  BRETHREN.  415 

all  good,  but  they  are  able  to  desire  some  natural  good,  for 
example,  that  it  may  be  well  with  their  parents  or  brethren.  For 
this  reason  S.  Chrysostom,  Ambrose,  and  Theophylact,  think  that 
the  rich  man,  influenced  by  the  ties  of  kindred  and  by  family 
affection,  really  was  anxious  for  the  welfare  of  his  brethren,  for 
nature  remains  the  same  even  in  the  damned.  The  action  of  Dives 
therefore  was  one  of  nature  and  not  of  virtue,  and  had  regard,  not 
to  actual  good,  but  to  natural  good  only,  as  the  action  of  animals  in 
nourishing  their  young. 

2,  The  rich  man  was  anxious  for  himself  more  than  for  his 
brethren,  for  he  considered  their  evil  his  own,  inasmuch  as  their 
condemnation  would  increase  his  torments,  because  he  was  the 
occasion  and  the  cause  of  their  evil  lives. 

Thus  S.  Gregory,  Lyranus,  and  others.  Cajetan  adds,  “Dives 
asked  this  out  of  the  pride  which  fills  the  hearts  of  the  damned, 
that  if  not  in  his  own  person,  at  least  in  the  person  of  his  brethren 
he  might  be  blessed  and  exalted.” 

Hence  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ This  rich  man  too  late  begins  to  be 
a master,  for  he  had  neither  time  for  learning  nor  teaching.” 

Ver.  29. — Abraham  saith  unto  him , They  have  Moses  and  the  Pro- 
phets , i.e.  the  writings  of  Moses  and  the  Prophets,  which  the  Scribes 
• and  Pharisees  read  and  expound  in  their  synagogues. 

Ver.  30. — And  he  said , Nay,  Father  Abraham:  but  if  one  went 
unto  them  from  the  dead,  they  will  repent  He  is  speaking  of  his 
own  experience.  For  as  he  had  been  affected,  so  does  he  think  it 
will  be  with  his  brethren.  S.  Chrysostom.  Titus  more  clearly  writes, 
" Why  does  the  rich  man  say  this  but  because  he  himself  had  heard 
the  prophets  to  little  purpose,  and  had  looked  upon  their  teaching 
as  untrue?  Therefore  he  conjectures  that  his  brethren  similarly 
regarded  them.  He  as  much  as  says,  ‘They  argue  as  I once 
argued.  Who  has  ever  given  any  description  of  hell — who  has  ever 
returned  thence?  But  if  any  one  were  sent  to  them  from  the  dead, 
they  would  believe  him,  and  give  diligent  heed  to  what  he  had 
to  say.'” 

Ver.  31. — And  he  said  unto  him , &c  They  will  say  that  Lazarus

is  a phantom,  sent  by  the  spirits  of  evil  to  deceive ; whereas  the 
writings  of  Moses  and  the  prophets  are  inspired,  are  accepted  by 
the  Jews  at  the  rule  of  faith,  according  to  that  which  is  written,  “ We 
have  now  a more  sure  word  of  prophecy ; whereunto  ye  do  well 
that  ye  take  heed,  as  unto  a light  that  shineth  in  a dark  place.* 
2 S.  Peter  i.  19. 

The  truth  of  the  Patriarch's  answer  is  proved  by  the  conduct  of 
the  Jews,  who  spoke  against  the  raising  of  the  other  Lazarus,  and 
the  resurrection  of  Christ  Himself,  and  refused  to  believe  in  Him. 

So  also  Peter,  who  three  years  after  death  was  recalled  to  life  by 
S.  Stanislaus,  Bishop  of  Cracow,  to  testify  concerning  some  land 
which  had  been  sold  by  the  king,  replied  to  those  who  asked  him 
concerning  the  other  world,  no  more  than  this,  “Ye  have  Moses  and 
the  prophets.  I have  been  sent  to  bear  witness,  not  to  preach.* 

Dives  therefore  obtained  none  of  his  requests,  because  it  is 
written,  “ Whoso  stoppeth  his  ears  at  the  cry  of  the  poor,  he  also  shall 
cry  himself,  but  shall  not  be  heard,”  Prov.  xxi.  13. 

Morally , we  learn  from  this  parable  or  rather  from  this  history, 

1.  That  God  has  appointed  to  each  his  lot,  and  has  made  some 
rich,  some  poor.  Let  each  one  therefore  be  content  with  that 
station  which  God  has  allotted  him.  Let  the  poor,  by  patient 
endurance  of  want,  and  the  rich,  by  the  liberal  relief  of  the  poor, 
seek  for  life  and  happiness  in  the  world  to  come.  For  Christ  seems 
to  have  spoken  this  parable  to  enforce  His  teaching,  “Make  to 
yourselves  friends  of  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness,  that  when  ye 
fail  they  may  receive  you  into  everlasting  habitations.”  The  rich 
man  was  not  compassionate,  and  therefore  he  was  rejected  by 
Abraham  and  Lazarus. 

s.  That  we  must  not  despise  the  poor  and  afflicted,  but  on  the 
contrary  render  all  the  assistance  which  lies  in  our  power.  For 
S.  Gregory  (Hon 1.  40)  says,  “ The  medicine  of  poverty  heals  those 
whom  moral  infirmity  wounds,  and  often  a pearl  lies  hidden  in  a 
dunghill,  i.e.  holiness  and  virtue  often  lie  hid  in  an  unclean  body, 
and  in  abject  poverty.  And  so  S.  Romula,  dying  of  poverty  and 
paralysis,  was  carried  to  heaven  by  a chorus  of  angels.  He  adds,

"THE  POOR  YOU  HAVE  ALWAYS  WITH  YOU.  4 1 7 

“ We  find  a Lazarus  every  day  if  we  seek  him,  and  even  if  we  seek 
him  not,  we  see  him.  Behold  how  importunately  the  poor  present 
themselves,  and  make  demands  on  us,  in  their  turn  to  intercede 
on  our  behalf  We  ought  certainly  to  ask  of  them,  yet  they  ask 
of  us.  Consider  whether  we  ought  to  refuse  what  is  demanded 
of  us  when  those  who  ask  are  our  patrons.” 

3.  That  the  rich  ought  not  to  boast  themselves  in  their  riches, 
for  riches  endure  but  for  a time,  and  death  deprives  men  of  their 
all.  Wherefore  let  them  not  set  their  hearts  upon  their  riches,  but 
on  God ; and  let  them  for  the  love  of  God  use  that  wherewith  He 
has  prospered  them  for  the  benefit  of  the  needy  and  poor.

CHAPTER  XVII. 

I Christ  teacheth  to  avoid  occasions  of  offence:  3 one  to  forgive  another:  6 the 
power  of  faith  : 7 how  we  are  bound  to  God \ and  not  he  to  us:  1 1 he  healeth  ten 
lepers  : 22  of  the  kingdom  of  Godt  and  the  coming  of  the  Son  of  Man, 

THEN  said  he  unto  the  disciples,  It  is  impossible  but  that  offences  will  come: 
but  woe  unto  him  through  whom  they  come  1 
2 It  were  better  for  him  that  a millstone  were  hanged  about  his  neck,  and  he 
cast  into  the  sea,  than  that  he  should  offend  one  of  these  little  ones. 

3  If  Take  heed  to  yourselves  : If  thy  brother  trespass  against  thee,  rebuke  him ; 
and  if  he  repent,  forgive  him. 

4  And  if  he  trespass  against  thee  seven  times  :n  a day,  and  seven  times  in  a 
day  turn  again  to  thee,  saying,  I repent ; thou  shalt  forgive  him. 

5  And  the  apostles  said  unto  the  Lord,  Increase  our  faith. 

6  And  the  Lord  said,  If  ye  had  faith  as  a grain  of  mustard  seed,  ye  might  say 
unto  this  sycamine  tree,  Be  thou  plucked  up  by  the  root,  and  be  thou  planted  in 
the  sea ; and  it  should  obey  you. 

7  But  which  of  you,  having  a servant  ploughing  or  feeding  cattle,  will  say  unto 
him  by  and  by,  when  he  is  come  from  the  field,  Go  and  sit  down  to  meat  ? 

8  And  will  not  rather  say  unto  him,  Make  ready  wherewith  I may  sup,  and 
gird  thyself,  and  serve  me,  till  I have  eaten  and  drunken  ; and  afterward  thou 
shalt  eat  and  drink  ? 

9  Doth  he  thank  that  servant  because  he  did  the  things  that  were  commanded 
him  ? I trow  not 

10  So  likewise  ye,  when  ye  shall  have  done  all  those  things  which  are  com- 
manded you,  say,  We  are  unprofitable  servants  : we  have  done  that  which  was 
our  duty  to  da 

11  H And  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  went  to  Jerusalem,  that  he  passed  through  the 
midst  of  Samaria  and  Galilee. 

12  And  as  he  entered  into  a certain  village,  there  met  him  ten  men  that  were 
lepers,  which  stood  afar  off : 

13  And  they  lifted  up  their  voices,  and  said,  Jesus,  Master,  have  mercy  on  us. 
14  And  when  he  saw  themt  he  said  unto  them,  Go  show  yourselves  unto  the 
priests.  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  as  they  went,  they  were  cleansed. 

15  And  one  of  them,  when  he  saw  that  he  was  healed,  turned  back,  and  with 
aloud  voice  glorified  God. 

16  And  fell  down  on  his  face  at  his  feet,  giving  him  thanks : and  he  was  a 
Samaritan. 

17  And  Jesus  answering  said,  Were  there  not  ten  cleansed?  but  where  an 
the  nine  ?

“INCREASE  OUR  FAITH.” 

1 8 There  ere  not  found  that  returned  to  give  glory  to  God,  save  this  stranger. 

19  And  he  said  unto  him,  Arise,  go  thy  way : thy  faith  hath  made  thee  whole. 

20  U And  when  he  was  demanded  of  the  Pharisees,  when  the  kingdom  of  God 
should  come,  be  answered  them  and  said,  The  kingdom  of  God  cometh  not  with 
observation  : 

21  Neither  shall  they  say,  Lo  here  ! or,  lo  there  1 for,  behold,  the  kingdom  of 
God  is  within  you. 

22  And  he  said  unto  the  disciples,  The  days  will  come,  when  ye  shall  desire  to 
see  one  of  the  days  of  the  Son  of  man,  and  ye  shall  not  see  it. 

23  And  they  shall  say  to  you.  See  here,  or,  see  there ; go  not  after  them,  nor 
follow  them. 

24  For  as  the  lightning,  that  lighteneth  out  of  the  one  part  under  heaven, 
shineth  unto  the  other  part  under  heaven  ; so  shall  also  the  Son  of  man  be  in 
his  day. 

25  But  first  must  he  suffer  many  things,  and  be  rejected  of  this  generation. 

26  And  as  it  was  in  the  days  of  Noe,  so  shall  it  be  also  in  the  days  of  the  Son 
of  man. 

27  They  did  eat,  they  drank,  they  married  wives,  they  were  given  in  marriage, 
until  the  day  that  Noe  entered  into  the  ark,  and  the  flood  came,  and  destroyed 
them  all. 

28  Likewise  also  as  it  was  in  the  days  of  Lot ; they  did  eat,  they  drank,  they 
bought,  they  sold,  they  planted,  they  builded ; 

29  But  the  same  day  that  Lot  went  out  of  Sodon  it  rained  fire  and  brimstone 
from  heaven,  and  destroyed  them  all. 

30  Even  thus  shall  it  be  in  the  day  when  the  Son  of  man  is  revealed. 

31  In  that  day,  he  which  shall  be  upon  the  housetop,  and  his  stuff  in  the 
house,  let  him  not  come  down  to  take  it  away : and  he  that  is  in  the  field,  let 
him  likewise  not  return  back. 

32  Remember  Lot’s  wife. 

33  Whosoever  shall  seek  to  save  his  life  shall  lose  it ; and  whosoever  shall  lose 
his  life  shall  preserve  it. 

34  I tell  you,  in  that  night  there  shall  be  two  men  in  one  bed ; the  one  shall 
be  taken,  and  the  other  shall  be  left. 

35  Two  women  shall  be  grinding  together ; the  one  shall  be  taken,  and  the 
other  left. 

36  Two  men  shall  be  in  the  field  ; the  one  shall  be  taken,  and  the  other  left. 

37  And  they  answered  and  said  unto  him,  Where,  Lord  ? And  he  said  unto 
them,  Wheresoever  the  body  is,  thither  will  the  eagles  be  gathered  together. 

Ver.  5. — And  the  Apostles  said  to  the  Lord , Increase  our  faith.  The 
Apostles  said  this,  when,  from  their  little  faith,  they  had  been  unable 
to  cast  out  the  devil  from  the  lunatic  They  then  asked  for  greater 
faith,  as  appears  from  the  above  words  compared  with  those  of  S. 
Matt.  xvii.  19,  &c.,  for  Christ  made  the  same  reply  in  each  place, “If 
you  had  faith  as  a grain  of  mustard  seed  you  would  move  mountains.” 
Ver.  6. — If  ye  had  faith.  “This  indeed,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,

“is  small  in  quantity  but  great  in  power.  He  means  that  the  least 
portion  of  faith  can  do  great  things.*  And  Bede,  “ Perfect  faith  is  a 
grain  of  mustard  seed : in  appearance  it  is  small,  in  the  heart  it  is 
fervent.” 

You  would  say  unto  this  sycamine  tree  (a  mulberry  tree  (moro)  close 
at  hand,  to  which  Christ  pointed).  Be  thou  rooted  up  and  be  thou 
cast  into  the  seaf  and  it  would  have  obeyed  you . — For  mulberry  tree, 
Matt.  xvii.  20  has  mountain.  Christ  therefore  said  both.  It  is 
called  the  mulberry  tree  allegorically,  as  if  tuaps  (foolish) ; that  is  by 
antithesis,  because  it  is  the  wisest  of  trees ; not  putting  forth  its  leaves 
till  the  frost  is  over,  lest  they  should  be  cut  off.  The  mulberry  sig- 
nifies the  gospel  of  the  cross  of  Christ,  which  to  the  Gentiles  appears 
foolishness,  but  to  the  faithful  is  “ the  power  of  God  and  the  wisdom 
of  God,”  1.  Cor.  L 24.  Hence  S.  Augustine  (Lib.  1 1,  Qucest.  Evan.  : 
qucest.  39) : “Let  those  servants  speak  through  the  grain  of  mustard 
seed,  to  this  mulberry  tree;  that  is,  to  the  gospel  of  the  cross  of 
Christ  through  the  blood-coloured  apples  hanging  like  wounds  on 
that  tree  which  is  to  give  food  to  the  nations.  Let  them  say  that  it 
is  rooted  up  by  the  unbelief  of  the  Jews,  and  transferred  to  the  sea 
of  the  Gentiles  and  planted  there,  for  by  this  home  service  they  will 
minister  to  the  hungering  and  thirsting  Lord.”  So  too  Bede.  “ The 
mulberry  tree,”  he  says,  u by  the  blood  colour  of  the  fruit  and  shoots, 
is  the  gospel  of  the  cross  of  Christ,  which,  through  the  faith  of  the 
Apostles,  when  it  was  held  as  it  were  in  the  stem  of  its  kind,  was 
rooted  up  from  the  Jews,  and  planted  in  the  sea  of  the  Gentiles.” 
The  Gloss  adds,  “ The  leaves  of  the  mulberry,  offered  to  the  serpent, 
bring  death  upon  him,  as  the  word  of  the  cross  destroys  all  hurtful 
and  venomous  things  of  the  soul.”  On  the  other  hand,  SS.  Ambrose 
and  Chrysostom  and  the  Gloss  understand  by  the  mulberry  tree,  the 
devil,  whom  the  faith  of  Christ  casts  out  and  sends  into  hell. 

1 The  fruit  of  the  mulberry  tree,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ is  firstly  white, 
when  in  flower,  when  fully  blown  red,  and  when  ripe  it  becomes 
black.  The  devil  also,  from  the  white  flower  of  his  angelic  nature 
and  power,  when  cast  out  by  his  reddening  wickedness,  grew  horrible 
from  the  foul  odour  of  sin.  Behold  Christ  saying  to  the  mulberry

4it 

tree,  1 Be  thou  rooted  up  and  cast  into  the  sea ; * when  He  cast  the 
Legion  out  of  the  man,  He  permitted  them  to  enter  into  the  swine 
which,  being  driven  by  the  spirit  of  the  devils,  cast  themselves  into 
the  sea.” 

Hear  also  S.  Chrysostom  in  the  Catena : “ As  the  mulberry  feeds 
worms  (silk-worms)  which  spin  silk  from  its  leaves,  so  does  the 
devil,  from  thoughts  springing  from  those  leaves,  nourish  in  us  an 
undying  worm ; but  faith  has  power  to  root  this  tree  out  of  our  souls, 
and  to  plunge  it  into  hell.” 

Lastly,  the  Arabic  for  the  mulberry  has  “sycamine,”  or  “syca- 
more,” of  which,  chap.  xix.  4.  Christ,  moreover,  exalts  the  power  of 
faith,  that  He  might  implant  in  the  Apostles  an  additional  desire  of 
increasing  its  keenness,  and  of  praying  for  its  gift  to  them ; for  He 
who  gave  to  men  the  mind  and  desire  of  praying,  wished  also  to 
increase  the  faith  of  those  who  prayed.  Hence  He  subsequently 
increased  their  faith,  especially  when  He  sent  the  Holy  Spirit  upon 
them  at  Pentecost  Hence  too,  by  the  strength  of  their  excelling 
faith,  they  wrought  so  great  wonders  and  miracles,  converting  the 
whole  world;  and,  lest  they  should  grow  proud  of  such  deeds, 
and  become  vainglorious,  Christ,  by  the  following  Parable,  teaches 
them  to  be  humble-minded,  and  to  say,  “we  are  unprofitable 
servants.” 

Ver.  7. — But  who  is  there  of  you,  having  a servant  ploughing  or  keep- 
ing  sheep . Christ  represses  the  vainglory  of  the  Apostles,  lest,  when 
by  their  exalted  faith  they  had  performed  wonderful  and  stupendous 
acts,  they  might  glory  in  them  and  not  ascribe  to  God,  whose  it  is, 
the  honour.  “He,”  says  Euthymius,“  who  attains  the  result,  plucks 
up  the  effect  of  boasting.  The  servant  was  not  a slave  as  the 
heretics  say,  but  one  who  was  hired,  and  who,  in  addition  to  the 
service  agreed  upon  or  ordered  by  his  master,  might  perform  another 
for  him  to  which  he  was  not  bound.”  Here  observe  that  the  heretics 
abuse  this  passage  to  the  opposing  of  good  works,  but  wrongly.  For 
this  servant,  as  clearly  appears,  truly  deserved  the  daily  payment  due 
to  him  by  agreement,  but  did  not  deserve  that  his  master  should 
render  him  thanks ; for  masters  are  not  accustomed  to  bestow  thanks

422 

upon  those  whom  they  pay  for  their  labour.  Thanks  are  only  given 
to  assistance  rendered  gratuitously  and  without  payment.  We  who 
are  the  servants  of  God,  through  the  works  ordered  by  Him,  if  we 
offer  them,  merit  eternal  life,  as  the  hired  servant  who  has  laboured 
throughout  the  day  deserves  his  daily  payment  Mark  ix.  41 ; Matt 
x.  41;  Apoc.  xi.  18.  For  although  our  works,  as  far  as  they  are 
ours,  are  of  little  or  no  value,  yet  so  far  as  they  flow  from  the  grace 
of  Christ,  and  are  therefore  the  works  of  Christ,  our  head,  they  are 
of  great  worth  and  desert,  and  do  merit,  as  such,  eternal  glory ; for 
grace  is  the  seed  of  glory : especially  as  God,  of  His  immeasurable 
goodness,  has  been  pleased  to  promise  to  them,  as  done  by  the  grace 
of  Christ,  eternal  glory. 

Vers.  8,  9. — And  will  not  rather  say  unto  him . That  is,  I suppose, 
because  he  does  not  owe  thanks  to  his  servants.  “ For  it  is 
incumbent  upon  such  an  one  to  do  his  master’s  will,”  says  Theo- 
phylact.  “So  there  is  laid  upon  us,”  as  Bede  says,  “the  necessity  of 
doing  all  things  that  God  has  commanded,  and  by  fresh  diligence,  of 
always  increasing  our  former  services.”  The  meaning  is,  as  S. 
Ambrose  says,  “ As  we  not  only  do  not  say  to  our  servant,  Take  thy 
repose  (recumbe),  but  require  of  him  a further  service,  and  give  him 
no  thanks,  so  neither  does  the  Lord  permit  in  us  one  only  work,  foi 
all  while  living  ought  to  work  always.  Acknowledge  we  ourselves 
therefore  to  be  servants,  lending  very  many  acts  of  obedience  on 
interest  Nor  should  we  exalt  ourselves,  because  we  are  called  the 
sons  of  God.  Grace  is  to  be  acknowledged,  but  nature  is  not  to  be 
passed  over  (ignoranda),  nor  should  we  boast  ourselves,  if  we  have 
served  well  in  that  which  we  ought  to  do.  The  sun  obeys,  the 
moon  submits,  the  angels  serve.” 

Ver.  10. — Even  so  ye  also . “Woe  unto  us  if  we  do  it  not,”  says 
S.  Bernard  in  his  fourth  sermon  on  Psalm  xv.  So  the  Apostle, 
1 Cor.  ix.  16,  “Woe  is  unto  me  if  I preach  not  the  gospel,”  because 
God  has  commanded  me  to  do  so. 

The  heretics  object,  “Christ  here  calls  His  faithful,  useless 
servants,  therefore  by  their  merits  they  deserve  nothing,  nay,  they 
do  nothing  good,  because  they  contribute  nothing  usefuL”  I

answer,  Their  first  premiss  is  false,  for  Christ  does  not  call  His  own 
servants  unprofitable,  nay,  in  Matt  xxv.  23,  He  says,  “Well  done, 
good  and  faithful  servant,”  &c.  But  He  warns  each  one  of  the 
faithful  to  call  himself  unprofitable,  to  the  avoidance  of  vainglory, 
and  to  the  greater  increase  of  humility  and  equally  so  of  their  merit, 
as  say  SS.  Ambrose,  Chrysostom,  Theophylact,  Bede,  and  others, 
passim ; and  that,  in  a sense  not  false  and  pretended  but  true  and 
sincere.  Because  the  faithful  servant,  in  merely  fulfilling  the  precepts 
of  God,  does  nothing  peculiar  or  remarkable,  but  only  that  which  by 
the  law  of  God  he  ought  to  do,  and  to  which  he  was  bound  under 
the  penalty  of  sin.  He  therefore  both  is,  and  is  called,  unprofitable, 
because  he  has  fulfilled  the  commandments  alone,  but  has  omitted 
the  counsels  and  works  of  supererogation,  as  Christ  Himself  explains  : 
“ All  things  that  are  commanded,”  and  “ what  we  ought  to  do  we  have 
done.”  He  therefore  gains  only  the  ordinary  reward  of  such  observ- 
ance of  His  commands ; but  to  that  exceptional  glory,  and  crown,  and 
aureole  of  the  observance  of  the  Evangelical  counsels  he  does  not 
attain ; as  says  S.  Paul,  whose  words  I will  shortly  cite.  Again,  says 
S.  Chrysostom,  “When  we  say,  with  humility,  we  are  unprofitable 
servants,”  Christ  says,  “Well  done,  good  and  faithful  servant” 

S.  Bernard  again,  in  his  treatise  de  Praeept  et  Dispens .,  thus 
explains  the  matter,  “ We  are  unprofitable  servants,  we  have  done 
what  we  ought ; ” £&  If  you  are  content  with  the  mere  precept  and 
traditions  of  the  law,  and  do  not  give  yourselves  up  to  the  counsels 
and  persuasions  of  perfection,  you  are  free  indeed  from  debt,  but 
you  are  not  praiseworthy  for  merit ; you  have  escaped  punishment, 
you  have  not  gained  the  crown. 

It  is  this  which  S.  Paul,  when  preaching  the  Gospel  freely,  and 
when  he  might  have  required  food  from  the  faithful,  1 Cor.  ix.  15, 
calls  his  glory. 

Secondly,  Even  S.  Paul  himself,  the  other  Apostles,  and  the 
Religious,  in  observing  not  only  the  precepts  but  also  the  counsels  of 
Christ,  can  truly  say,  “ We  are  unprofitable  servants : we  have  done 
what  we  ought  to  do.”  Firstly,  because  we  owe  to  God  our  souls, 
our  bodies,  our  lives,  and  all  that  we  have,  which,  whatever  good  we

do,  we  can  never  pay  back.  This  debt  is  infinite  and  manifold,  but 
it  is  especially  fourfold.  First,  there  is  the  debt  of  creation,  for  as 
we  were  created  out  of  nothing  by  God,  the  whole  that  we  are  we 
owe  to  God  our  Creator.  Thus  Plato  in  his  Phsedo,  “ Man  is  one  of 
the  possessions  of  God.”  “Behold,”  says  S.  Bernard  on  “Our 
Fourfold  Debt,”  “He  is  at  the  door  who  made  the  heavens  and 
the  earth.  He  is  thy  Creator,  and  thou  art  His  creature : thou  art  the 
end  of  His  work.”  The  second  is  the  debt  of  emption  and  redemp- 
tion, for  Christ  redeemed  us  from  death  and  hell  at  the  price  of  His 
own  blood.  We  are  therefore  slaves  of  purchase,  nay,  “the  pur- 
chased servants  of  Christ,”  i Cor.  vi  20.  S.  Bernard,  in  the  sermon 
already  cited  : “ Firstly,  we  owe  all  our  lives  to  Christ  Jesus,  for  He 
laid  down  His  life  for  us,  and  endured  bitter  torments,  that  we  might 
not  have  to  undergo  eternal  ones.”  He  sums  up  thus : “ When  I give 
to  Him  all  that  I am,  all  that  I can  do,  is  not  this  as  a star  to  the 
sun,  a drop  to  the  river,  a stone  to  the  mountain,  a grain  to  the 
heap  ? ” So  in  his  tract,  De  Deo  dilig. : “ If  I owe  my  whole  self  for 
my  first  creation,  what  shall  I add  for  my  second,  and  that  brought 
about  as  it  was  ? For  a second  creation  is  not  effected  as  easily  as 
a first  He  who  made  me  once  and  only  by  a word,  in  creating  me 
a second  time  spoke  many  words  and  did  wonderful  things  and 
endured  hard  things,  and  not  only  hard  but  even  undeserved  things. 
In  the  first  creation  He  gave  me  to  myself  in  the  second  He  gave 
Himself  to  me,  and  when  He  gave  Himself  to  me  He  restored  me 
to  myself.  Given,  then,  and  restored,  I owe  myself  for  myself,  and  I 
have  a double  debt  What  reward  shall  I give  to  God  for  Himself, 
for  if  I were  to  weigh  myself  a thousand  times,  what  am  I to  God  ?” 

The  third  debt  is,  that  renouncing  Satan  in  our  baptism  we  have 
given  ourselves  wholly  over  to  the  obedience  of  Christ;  He  in 
regenerating  us  in  Himself  has  made  us  new  men,  and  divine,  who 
are  the  Temple  of  God  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost. 

The  fourth  is  that  He  is  our  beginning  and  final  end,  and  He  to 
whom  we  ought  to  direct  all  our  actions.  For  He  has  promised  us 
the  happiness  of  heaven,  and  everlasting  glory,  which  is  nothing  else 
than  the  vision  and  fruition  of  God  See  Jerome  (Flatus,  Book  L,

god's  rig&t  to  our  service. 


4*5 


On  the  Grace  oi  a Religious  State,  chapters  in.  iv.),  where  he 
recounts  seven  titles  of  our  service,  on  account  of  which  we  are  not 
of  our  own  right,  but  are  God's  and  Christ's. 

To  these  add  that  we  are  unprofitable  servants  in  respect  of  God ; 
for,  to  God,  who  is  immense,  most  rich,  and  most  blessed,  we  can 
add  no  good  thing.  Hence  S.  Augustine  on  Psalm  xxxix. : “ He  pos- 
sesses thee  that  thou  mayest  possess  Him.  Thou  wilt  be  His  land, 
Thou  wilt  be  His  house.  He  possesses  thee,  He  is  possessed  by 
thee,  that  He  may  profit  thee.  Canst  thou  profit  Him  in  any  way  ? 
For  I said  to  the  Lord,  ‘ Thou  art  my  God,  therefore  shall  I want  no 
good  thing."' 

Again,  we  are  unprofitable,  because  we  sin  in  many  things,  and 
many  of  our  words  are  infected  by  negligence  or  vainglory  or  some 
other  fault  In  addition  to  this,  our  actions,  if  looked  upon  with 
strictness,  as  they  proceed  from  men,  are  without  value  to  the 
meriting  of  the  grace  and  glory  of  God : according  to  the  Apostle, 
Rom.  viii.  18.  So  S.  Augustine,  whose  words  I will  shortly  produce. 
Lastly,  all  our  actions  derive  the  dignity  of  worth  and  merit  from  the 
grace  and  promise  of  God,  and  are  useful  to  ourselves,  not  to  Him. 
Hence  the  Arabic  reads,  “ We  are  indeed  useless  servants,  for  we 
have  done  that  which  was  our  interest  to  do.”  So  Euthymius,  S. 
Cyril  in  the  Catena^  and  others. 

And  thus  did  those  monks  of  the  Alps  to  whom  S.  Bernard  wrote 
his  153d  Epistle;  “You  account  yourselves  unprofitable,  and  you 
have  been  found  to  be  humble.  To  act  rightly,  and  yet  to  think 
themselves  without  value,  is  found  in  few,  and  therefore  many  admire 
it.  This  I say,  this  assuredly  makes  you,  from  illustrious,  even  more 
illustrious;  from  holy,  more  holy;  and  wherever  this  report  is 
published  it  fills  all  things  with  the  odour  of  sweetness ; ” for,  as  the 
same  author  says  in  his  43d  Sermon  on  Canticles,  “ Humility,  like 
the  ointment  of  spikenard,  scatters  its  sweet  scent,  growing  warm  in 
love,  flourishing  in  devotion,  smelling  pleasantly  to  the  senses  of 
others.” 

S.  Augustine  indeed,  for  useless  servants  (inutiles)  reads  super- 
vacui,  men  at  leisure,  who  after  their  labour  look  for  repose ; that

eternal  reward  and  glory  which  far  surpass  and  exceed  all  their  toiL 
“ Nothing  remains  for  us  to  do : we  have  finished  our  trial,  there 
awaits  us  a crown  of  righteousness.  We  may  say  all  things  of  that 
ineffable  perfruition,  and  the  more  all  things  can  be  said  the  less 
can  anything  be  said  worthily ; for  it  is  the  light  of  the  illuminator,  the 
repose  of  the  toiler,  the  country  of  the  returned  wanderer,  the  food 
of  the  needy,  the  crown  of  the  conqueror,  whatever  the  temporal 
goods  of  unbelievers  the  holiness  of  the  sons  of  God  will  find  others 
more  true,  and  such  as  will  remain  in  the  Creator  to  all  eternity.” 
Hence  the  conclusion  of  Theophylact,  “ If  when  we  have  done  all 
things,  we  ought  not  even  then  to  have  any  lofty  thoughts;  how 
deeply  do  we  sin  when  we  do  not  perform  the  greatest  part  of  the 
commandments  of  God,  and  yet  are  praised  not  the  less.” 

Ver.  ii. — And  it  came  to  pass  as  He  was  going  up  to  Jerusalem 
from  the  borders  of  Caesarea  Philippi  or  Paneas,  as  is  clear  from  S. 
Matt  xvii.  22,  to  Jerusalem ; to  the  feast  of  tabernacles,  as  appears 
from  S.  John  vii.  2.  He  went  through  the  midst  of  Samaria  and 
Galilee;  for  this  was  the  direct  road  for  one  journeying  from 
Caesarea  to  Jerusalem.  Mention  is  made  of  Samaria  to  suggest 
a reason  why,  among  the  ten  lepers  that  were  healed  by  Christ,  one 
was  a Samaritan ; namely,  that  as  Christ  was  going  through  Samaria, 
although  He  had  been  inhospitably  received  by  the  Samaritans,  nay, 
shut  out  from  one  of  their  towns,  ix.  53,  He  yet  wished  to  do  good 
to  a Samaritan,  that  He  might  return  kindness  for  ill-treatment 
See  the  chronological  order  of  events  which  I .have  prefixed  to  this 
commentary. 

Ver.  12. — And  as  He  entered  into  a certain  village . Lepers,  as 
being  unclean,  were  not  able  to  enter  cities,  towns  and  villages,  lest 
they  should  communicate  their  leprosy  to  the  inhabitants,  as  well  as 
their  legal  defilement,  which  under  the  old  law  was  communicated 
by  contact  with  a leprous  and  unclean  person ; as  in  Numb.  v.  2. 
Hence  they  met  Christ  before  the  village. 

There  were  ten  lepers,  says  Euthymius,  whom  their  disease  had 
united  together;  for  otherwise  the  Jews  hold  no  communication  with 
the  Samaritans,  John  iv.  9.  These  ten  lepers  seem  to  have  agreed,

THE  TEN  LEPERS  CURED.  427 

as  soon  as  they  met  Jesus,  to  demand  to  be  healed  with  one  voice. 
They  made  an  attack  upon  the  clemency  of  Jesus, 

They  stood  afar  off,  as  being  unclean  and  out  of  communion  with 
the  clean,  being  banished  lest  they  should  affect  them  by  their 
breath.  In  figure  leprosy  is  concupiscence,  heresy,  and  every  kind 
of  sin,  as  is  shown  in  Levit  xiii.  xiv,  and  Matt  viii.  2. 

Ver.  13. — And  they  lifted  up  their  voices . They  cried  out  aloud, 
because  they  stood  afar  off.  The  voice  was  one  and  proceeded 
from  all,  “Jesus,  Master,*  have  mercy  on  us,  and  free  us  from  this 
heavy  and  incurable  disease.  Master  here  does  not  so  much  mean 
teacher  as  Lord,  one  who  directs  his  servants  and  tells  them  his 
wishes.  The  Greek  is  iwiarara,  that  is  Prsefect — Praeses ; one  whose 
right  it  is  to  rule  and  command  : for  they  do  not  ask  Christ  to  teach 
them,  and  give  them  precepts  of  virtue,  but  to  command  the  leprosy 
and  cause  it  to  depart  from  them.  So  the  Hebrew,  Rabbi,  means 
not  only  master  but  also  Lord,  and  Mighty,  and  One  of  the  first 
rank.  Moreover,  S.  Luke  everywhere  calls  Christ  Merara,  as  is  seen 
v.  5,  viii.  24,  45,  ix.  33,  49 ; S.  Matt,  also,  viii.  25,  xvii.  4,  and  else- 
where, has  xfyn,  that  is  Lord.  So  the  Gauls,  Germans,  and  Belgians 
call  their  masters  Lords,  Domini,  mon  maistre,  mein  meister. 

And  when  He  saw  them  He  said  unto  them . Theophylact  says, 
“They  stood  afar  off  indeed  in  position,  but  they  were  near  in 
speech,  for  ‘The  Lord  is  nigh  unto  all  that  call  upon  Him/” 
Ps.  cxlv.  18. 

Ver.  14. — He  said  unto  them , Go  and  shew  yourselves  unto  the 
priests . That  is,  if  you  go  to  them  and  obey  Me,  you  shall  assuredly 
be  healed  of  your  leprosy  by  My  power  and  providence. 

And  it  came  to  pass , as  they  went  Christ  commanded  them  to  go 
to  the  priests,  not  that  they  might  be  healed  by  them,  for  this  was 
impossible,  but  firstly,  for  the  honour  and  deference  due  to  the  priest- 
hood ; secondly,  because  the  law  commanded  lepers,  if  they  were 
healed,  to  show  themselves  to  the  priests,  that  by  their  means  they 
might  be  brought  back  to  the  city  and  temple,  and  to  the  society  of 
men.  The  priests,  moreover,  had  their  own  signs  by  which  they 
might  know  whether  a man  were  a leper  or  not,  as  I have  shown

before.  Thirdly,  to  prove  the  faith  and  obedience  of  the  lepers,  for 
they  knew  themselves  to  be  lepers,  and  that  they  could  not  be 
healed  by  the  priests,  but  only  that  their  leprosy  could  be  declared. 
Yet  they  went  to  them  at  the  command  of  Christ,  believing  that  they 
would  thus  be  healed  by  Him  before  they  came  to  the  priests.  For 
if  they  had  not  so  believed  they  would  assuredly  not  have  gone  to 
them.  Fourthly,  that  Christ  might  make  the  priests  witnesses  of 
the  miraculous  healing  done  by  Him,  and  that  from  this  they  might 
know  that  He  was  the  Christ. 

Allegorically . Christ  wished  to  signify  that  mystical  lepers,  that 
is  sinners  in  the  New  Law,  ought  to  come  to  the  priests  that  they 
may  be  healed  by  penance,  and  absolved  from  the  leprosy  of  sin. 
“ It  is  not,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ the  duty  of  the  priest,  under  the 
New  Law,  to  prove  the  leprosy,  as  it  was  under  the  Old,  but  to 
cleanse  and  expiate  it  when  proved.”  Lib.  iii.  de  Sacerdotio. 

And  as  they  went \ they  were  cleansed . “ In  ceytain  faith  and  blind 

obedience,  not  judging  of  the  command,”  says  Eiithymius.  It  is  pro- 
bable that  immediately  on  their  going  they  were  healed,  that  they 
might  know  it  to  have  been  done  by  Jesus.  Hence  the  Samaritan, 
perceiving  what  had  happened,  and  that  he  was  cured,  returned  to 
Jesus  and  gave  thanks.  Thus  is  God  wont  to  reward  prompt  faith 
and  obedience. 

They  were  cleansed \ From  their  leprosy,  which  among  the  Jews 
was  the  greatest  of  uncleannesses,  both  natural  and  legal ; especially 
because  it  was  contagious,  and  made  those  who  came  near,  leprous 
and  unclean. 

Ver.  15. — And  one  of  them, , when  he  saw  that  he  was  healed, . He 
left  the  road  and  went  back  to  Jesus,  the  Author  of  his  heal- 
ing, magnifying  God  with  a loud  voice,  who,  through  Jesus,  had 
healed  him. 

Ver.  1 6. — And fell  down  on  his  face  at  His feet.  That  by  profound 
humiliation  he  might  show  his  great  reverence  to  Him,  as  in  the  Greek 
and  Syriac.  And  he  was  a Samaritan  : a Samaritan,  and  therefore 
an  alien  from  and  abhorrent  to  the  Jews,  a schismatic  moreover,  so 
that  it  was  wonderful  that  he  alone  gave  thanks  so  earnestly  to  Jesus,

who  was  a Jew,  when  the  other  lepers,  who  were  Jews  by  nation  and 
religion,  passed  Him  by  and  gave  no  thanks  for  so  great  a benefit 

Ver.  17. — And /esus  answering  said \ Why  do  not  the  nine,  equally 
with  this  Samaritan,  return  and  acknowledge  their  cure,  and  give  Me 
thanks?  In  truth  the  nine  were  rejoiced  at  their  cure,  and  went 
to  the  priests,  that  they  might  be  declared  to  be  clean,  and  restored 
to  the  society  of  men,  thinking  wholly  of  themselves,  and  caring 
very  little  for  the  glory  of  Jesus. 

Ver.  18. — There  are  not  found  that  returned . By  confessing  and 
declaring  themselves  cured  by  God  through  Christ  of  their  leprosy, 
which  was  a great  glory  to  God. 

Save  this  stranger.  That  is,  except  this  Samaritan,  who  was  a 
stranger  to  the  nation  and  religion  of  the  Jews.  For  the  Samaritans 
were  Babylonians,  Assyrians  and  Medians,  and  were  transferred  by 
Shalmanezer  to  Samaria.  2 Kings  xvii.  24.  The  Syriac  says,  “Why 
were  they  separated,  so  that  none  gave  glory  to  God  except  this 
one?”  He  represents  the  Gentiles,  who  were  to  believe  in  Christ, 
and  give  Him  thanks,  when  the  unbelieving  Jews  would  hold  Him 
in  contempt  We  thus  see  that  strangers  are  often  more  grateful 
than  natives ; because  strangers  wonder  at  strange  benefactors  more, 
and  pay  them  greater  respect  than  natives,  who,  as  familiar  with 
their  benefactors,  think  that  benefits  are  their  due  from  the  right  of 
country.  Moreover,  they  were  ashamed  to  humble  themselves  before 
their  own  countrymen,  and  to  acknowledge  the  misery  from  which 
they  had  been  delivered.  Rightly  therefore  does  Christ  blame  them ; 
and  He  might  with  justice  have  deprived  them  of  the  benefit  of  the 
cure,  and  allowed  them  to  fall  back  again  into  their  leprosy.  But 
He  would  not  do  this,  because  His  mercy  was  so  great  that  it 
extended  even  to  the  ungrateful  S.  Bernard  sharply  rebukes  the 
wickedness  of  ingratitude,  Serin.  11  on  Canticles.  He  says,  “ It  is 
the  enemy  of  our  souls,  the  inanition  of  our  merits,  the  disperser  of 
our  virtues,  the  ruin  of  our  benefactions.  Ingratitude  is  a burning 
wind,  drying  up  the  Fountain  of  Holiness,  the  dew  of  mercy,  the 
streams  of  grace.” 

Ver.  19. — And  He  said  unto  him,  Arise,  go  thy  way:  thy faith.  Faith,

by  which  you  have  believed  that  I am  able  to  save  you,  nay  that  I 
will  do  so,  if  you  obey  Me,  and  go  to  the  priests.  For  this  faith  has 
worked  with  your  healing,  even  though  I be  the  primary  author. 
Hence  very  likely  the  prompting  of  God  elicited  from  this  leper 
some  act  of  contrition  by  which  he  was  justified ; and  that  he  then 
left  the  schism  of  the  Samaritans,  and  joined  the  true  religion  of  the 
Jews.  In  the  end  he  became  a disciple  of  Jesus,  and  received  His 
baptism,  and  became  a Christian  and  preached  the  power  and 
miracle  of  Christ  and  converted  many  to  Him. 

Ver.  so. — And  when  He  was  demanded  of  the  Pharisees , The 
Kingdom  of  Israel,  which  had  now  indeed  fallen,  but  which  was  to 
be  raised  up  again  by  the  Messiah. 

The  kingdom  of  God  cometh  not  with  observation,  “ Cometh,”  th  at 
is,  will  come.  It  is  a Hebraism,  in  which  the  present  is  put  for 
the  future.  Observe  that  Christ  said,  “Repent,  for  the  kingdom 
of  God  is  at  hand.”  This  Pharisee,  therefore,  either  from  a desire 
of  knowledge,  or  to  mock  Jesus,  said,  “Thou  Jesus  preachest 
Thy  kingdom  in  heaven,  but  when  will  it  come?  When  shall 
we  see  Thee  reigning  in  it?  When  shall  we  see  Israel,  who  is 
now  subjugated  by  the  Romans,  breathe  again  through  Thy  means 
and  recover  her  liberty  and  live  happily  under  Thee  as  her  king?” 
“ They  asked  Him  when  He  would  reign,”  says  Euthymius,  “ as 
to  deride  Him,  who  appeared  as  one  of  low  estate.”  But  Christ 
answered  mildly  and  briefly  at  first  as  in  this  verse,  but  afterwards 
at  more  length  (verse  22  to  the  end  of  the  chapter).  He  spoke  of 
the  glory  of  His  kingdom  in  the  heavens,  to  which  that  of  grace 
should  first  be  subordinated  on  earth,  for  we  proceed  to  glory 
through  grace.  He  said  therefore, 

The  kingdom  of  God,  The  kingdom  of  God  and  the  Messiah 
cometh  not  with  previous  preparation,  nor  with  the  outward  pomp 
of  soldiers,  horses,  and  chariots,  as  you  can  see,  from  itself  You 
know  a king  to  be  at  hand  when  you  see  his  attendants  preceding 
him.  With  such  as  these  you  thought  that  the  kingdom  of  the 
Messiah  would  come,  and  you  look  for  it  as  now  nigh  at  hand.

the  royal  throne  of  Christ,  He  reigns  there  in  magnificence  like  another 
Solomon ; because  Christ  does  not  reign  on  a bodily  throne,  but  in  a 
spiritual  soul,  which  by  His  grace  He  rules  and  directs  into  all  good, 
and  so  guides  it  to  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  For  the  kingdom  of 
God  is  not  meat  and  drink,  but  righteousness,  and  peace,  and  joy 
in  the  Holy  Ghost^  Rom.  xiv.  17.  I would  understand  all  these 
sayings  of  the  same  thing : that  is,  of  the  first  Advent  of  Christ,  in 
which  He  reigns  in  the  souls  of  the  faithful  as  a king  through  His 
grace ; for  thus  do  His  sayings,  as  a whole,  best  agree  together  and 
cohere.  Some,  however,  understand  the  kingdom  of  glory,  because 
He  will  adorn  even  the  bodies  of  the  just  with  His  own  brightness, 
and  other  gifts,  as  all  may  see. 

Secondly,  This  kingdom  of  God  is  within  us : that  is,  it  is  in  our 
own  power  if  we  embrace  the  faith  and  grace  of  Christ,  and  work 
with  Him,  for,  as  Titus  says,  “ It  is  of  our  own  will  and  power  to 
receive  the  kingdom  of  God.” 

Thirdly,  The  kingdom  of  God  is  within  us,  because  Christ,  as  our 
God  and  king,  lives  among  us  preaching  and  endowing  this  kingdom. 
Thus  speaks  Theophylact : “ The  kingdom  of  God  on  the  whole  is 
to  live  after  the  manner  of  the  angels,  when  nothing  of  this  world 
occupies  our  souls.  We  need  no  long  time  and  no  distant  journey, 
for  faith  is  near  us,  and  after  faith  the  divine  life.”  The  same  also 
said  the  Apostle,  “The  word  is  nigh  thee,  in  thy  mouth  and  in  thy 
heart,  that  is,  the  word  of  faith,”  Rom.  x.  8.  For  to  believe,  and  to 
walk  worthily  of  our  belief  and  of  our  calling,  is  within  us.  The 
Pharisees  therefore  derided  the  Lord,  but  He  turned  them  into  ridi- 
cule, showing  that  they  were  ignorant  of  that  which  was  within  them 
and  which  is  very  easy  to  any  one  who  wishes  for  it.  " For  now 
when  I am  in  the  midst  of  you,  you  are  able  to  possess  the  kingdom 
of  God  if  you  believe  in  Me  and  will  live  according  to  My  com- 
mandments.” 

Ver.  22. — And  He  said  unto  His  disciples , The  days  will  come. 
That  is,  the  time  will  come  and  is  now  at  hand,  when  for  My  faith 
and  the  preaching  of  the  gospel  you  will  suffer  many  adversities, 
persecutions,  and  distresses ; the  errors  and  heresies,  moreover,  of  the

innovators ; and  be  oppressed  by  straits  of  body  and  mind,  and  know 
not  what  consolation  or  counsel  to  take.  Hence  you  shall  seek  to 
see  Me,  and  to  consult  Me,  if  only  once,  but  in  vain : for  after  I 
shall  have  ascended  into  heaven,  I shall  no  more  appear  on  earth. 
Thus  the  things  you  now  hear  from  Me  you  ought  to  teach,  and  to 
console,  and  to  direct,  until,  at  my  second  coming  to  judgment,  I 
return  to  you,  that  is,  to  your  successors.  Thus  He  spoke  to  warn 
them  that  they  could  only  come  to  the  kingdom  of  glory  through 
tribulations,  that  they  might  neither  fail  in  heart  nor  fall  from  the 
faith.  So  Theophylact,  Euthymius,  Titus,  Bede,  and  others. 

Ver.  23. — And  they  shall  say  to  you.  False  prophets  shall  come 
feigning  themselves  to  be  Christ  or  sent  from  Christ  Go  not  out, 
neither  follow  those  deceivers  or  their  rumours.  The  Arabic  has, 
44  See  them  not,  nor  hasten  to  them.” 

Ver.  24. — For  as  the  lightning.  The  Syriac  has,  44  As  the  lightning 
shines  from  heaven  and  lightens  all  things  under  heaven.”  As 
the  lightning  most  suddenly,  swiftly,  and  openly  descends  from 
heaven  and  shines  out,  so  shall  I suddenly  and  unexpectedly  return 
to  judgment  There  will  be  no  need  of  watching  for  Me,  or  sign, 
or  mark,  for  I shall  appear  conspicuous  and  glorious  to  all  in  the 
whole  earth.  This  and  the  following  we  have  read  in  Matt  xxiv.  27 
and  following,  where  I have  explained  it 

Ver.  25. — But  first  must  He  suffer  many  things.  The  Arabic  has, 
44  Before  this  He  shall  endure  much  suffering,  and  be  rejected  by 
this  generation.” — 44  That  is,”  says  Euthymius, 44  by  this  nation  of  a 
few  Jews.  He  said  this  firstly,  lest  the  Apostles,  seeing  Him  suffering 
and  being  put  to  death  on  the  cross,  should  be  offended,  and  doubt 
whether  He  were  the  Christ.”  Secondly,  as  Bede  says,  44  that  when 
they  saw  Him  dying,  who,  they  thought  should  be  glorified,  the  pain 
of  His  sufferings  might  be  lightened  to  them  by  the  hope  of  the 
promised  glory.”  Thirdly,  that  He  might  arm  them  against  future 
sufferings  by  this  prophecy.  44  As  if  He  had  said,”  says  Theophy- 
lact, 44  Wonder  not  if  troubles  come  upon  you,  so  great  as  to  make 
you  wish  for  the  days  when  I was  with  you.  For  even  I myself, 
who  will  come  as  the  lightning,  must  first  suffer  many  things,  and

be  rejected,  and  so  come  into  that  glory.  Let  this  be  your  example, 
for  to  you  also  shall  come  glory  from  perils.” 

Ver.  30. — Even  thus  shall  it  be  in  the  day  when  the  Son  of  man  is 
revealed.  “ Well  does  Christ  say,”  says  Bede,  “ that  He  shall  be 
revealed  as  one  who,  not  being  seen,  sees  all  things,  and  then  appear- 
ing, shall  judge  all  things.” 

Ver.  32. — Remember  Lofs  wife . She  perished  because  she  looked 
back.  “Lest,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “as  she  looked  back  on  the 
burning  Sodom,  against  the  command  of  the  angel,  and  was  changed 
into  a pillar  of  salt,  so  you  also,  against  these  commandments  of 
mine,  may  return  to  the  life  of  the  world,  and  perish  with  that  which 
is  perishing  and  burning.”  S.  Augustine  (Libii  Quasi.  Evang.  qucest. 
43) : “ What  is  the  meaning  of  Lot's  wife  ? She  represents  those  who 
look  back  in  tribulation  and  separate  themselves  from  the  hope  of  the 
Divine  Promise,  and  who  are  therefore  changed  into  a pillar  of  salt, 
that  by  admonishing  men  not  to  do  the  same,  they  may,  as  it  were, 
season  their  hearts,  and  not  become  fools.” 

Ver.  34. — In  that  night  there  shall  be  two  men  in  one  bed  By  the 
word  night  it  may  be  thought  that  the  universal  judgment  of  Christ 
will  take  place  at  night,  for  the  greater  terror  of  men.  But  I reply, 
That  which  in  verse  31  is  called  day,  is  here  called  night  First, 
Because  the  day  of  judgment  will  be  to  very  many,  and  certainly  to 
all  who  have  fallen  away,  fatal  and  most  calamitous.  For  night  and 
darkness  are  symbols  of  calamity.  Secondly,  As  night  closes  the 
day  and  the  time  of  labour,  so  will  that  day  also  close  the  time  of 
labouring  and  meriting,  according  to  the  words,  “ The  night  cometh 
when  no  man  can  work.”  John  ix.  4.  Rightly  then  is  the  day  of 
judgment  called  night.

CHAPTER  XVIII. 

3  Of  the  importunate  widow.  9 Of  the  Pharisee  and  the  publican . 15  Children 
brought  to  Christ . 1 8 A ruler  that  would  follow  Christ , but  is  hindered  by  his 

riches.  28  The  reward  of  them  that  leave  all  for  his  sake.  31  He  foresheweth 
his  death , 35  and  restoreth  a blind  man  to  his  sight. 

AND  he  spake  a parable  unto  them  to  this  endt  that  men  ought  always  to  pray, 
and  not  to  faint ; 

2 Saying,  There  was  in  a city  a judge,  which  feared  not  God,  neither  regarded 
man : 

3 And  there  was  a widow  in  that  city  ; and  she  came  unto  him,  saying,  Avenge 
me  of  mine  adversary. 

4  And  he  would  not  for  a while  : but  afterward  he  said  within  himself,  Though 
I fear  not  God,  nor  regard  man  ; 

5  Yet  because  this  widow  txoubleth  me,  I will  avenge  her,  lest  by  her  con- 
tinual coming  she  weary  me. 

6  And  the  Lord  said,  Hear  what  the  unjust  judge  saith. 

7  And  shall  not  God  avenge  his  own  elect,  which  cry  day  and  night  unto  him, 
though  he  bear  long  with  them  ? 

8  I tell  you  that  he  will  avenge  them  speedily.  Nevertheless  when  the  Son  ol 
man  cometh,  shall  he  find  faith  on  the  earth  ? 

9  And  he  spake  thU  parable  unto  certain  which  trusted  in  themselves  that  they 
were  righteous,  and  despised  others : 

10  Two  men  went  up  into  the  temple  to  pray  ; the  one  a Pharisee,  and  the  other 
a publican. 

1 1  The  Pharisee  stood  and  prayed  thus  with  himself,  God,  1 thank  thee,  that  I 
am  not  as  other  men  are , extortioners,  unjust,  adulterers,  or  even  as  this  publican. 
12  I fast  twice  in  the  week,  I give  tithes  of  all  that  I possess. 

13  And  the  publican,  standing  afar  off,  would  not  lift  up  so  much  as  his  eyes 
unto  heaven,  but  smote  upon  his  breast,  saying,  God  be  merciful  to  me  a sinner. 

14  I tell  you,  this  man  went  down  to  his  house  justified  rather  than  the  other ; 
for  every  one  that  exalteth  himself  shall  be  abased  ; and  he  that  humbleth  him- 
self  shall  be  exalted. 

15  And  they  brought  unto  him  also  infants,  that  he  would  touch  them  : but 
when  his  disciples  saw  */,  they  rebuked  them. 

16  But  Jesus  called  them  unto  him^  and  said,  Suffer  little  children  to  come  unto 
me  and  forbid  them  not ; for  of  such  is  the  kingdom  of  God. 

17  Verily  I say  unto  you,  Whosoever  shall  not  receive  the  kingdom  of  God  as 
a little  child  shall  in  no  wise  enter  therein.

THE  HOLY  GOSPEL  OF  ST.  LUKE.  435 

18  And  a certain  ruler  asked  him,  saying,  Good  Master,  what  shall  I do  to  in- 
herit eternal  life  ? 

19  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Why  callest  thou  me  good  ? none  *>  good,  save 
one,  that  is,  God. 

20  Thou  knowest  the  commandments,  Do  not  commit  adultery,  Do  not  kill,  Do 
not  steal,  Do  not  bear  false  witness,  Honour  thy  father  and  thy  mother. 

21  And  he  said,  All  these  have  I kept  from  my  youth  up. 

22  Now  when  Jesus  heard  these  things,  he  said  unto  him,  Yet  lackest  thou  one 
thing:  sell  all  that  thou  hast,  and  distribute  unto  the  poor,  and  thou  shalt  have 
treasure  in  heaven  : and  come,  follow  me. 

23  And  when  he  heard  this,  he  was  very  sorrowful : for  he  was  very  rich. 

24  And  when  Jesus  saw  that  he  was  very  sorrowful,  he  said,  How  hardly  shall 
they  that  have  riches  enter  into  the  kingdom  of  God  ! 

25  For  it  is  easier  for  a camel  to  go  through  a needle’s  eye  than  for  a rich  man 
to  enter  into  the  kingdom  of  God. 

26  And  they  that  heard  it  said.  Who  then  can  be  saved  ? 

27  And  he  said,  The  things  which  are  impossible  with  men  are  possible  with  God. 

28  Then  Peter  said,  Lo,  we  have  left  all,  and  followed  thee. 

29  And  he  said  unto  them.  Verily  I say  unto  you,  There  is  no  man  that  hath  left 
house,  or  parents,  or  brethren,  or  wife,  or  children,  for  the  kingdom  of  God’s  sake, 

30  Who  shall  not  receive  manifold  moie  in  this  time,  and  in  the  world  to  come 
life  everlasting. 

31  Then  he  took  unto  him  the  twelve,  and  said  unto  them,  Behold,  we  go  up 
to  Jerusalem,  and  all  things  that  are  written  by  the  prophets  concerning  the  Son 
of  man  shall  be  accomplished. 

32  For  he  shall  be  delivered  unto  the  Gentiles,  and  shall  be  mocked,  and  spite- 
fully entreated,  and  spitted  on  : 

33  And  they  shall  scourge  him , and  put  him  to  death  : and  the  third  day  he  shall 
rise  again. 

34  And  they  understood  none  of  these  things  : and  this  saying  was  hid  from 
them,  neither  knew  they  the  things  which  were  spoken. 

35  T And  it  came  to  pass,  that  as  he  was  come  nigh  unto  Jericho,  a certain 
blind  man  sat  by  the  way  side  begging : 

36  And  hearing  the  multitude  pass  by,  he  asked  what  it  meant. 

37  And  they  told  him,  that  Jesus  of  Nazareth  passeth  by. 

38  And  he  cried,  saying,  Jesus,  thou  son  of  David,  have  mercy  on  me. 

39  And  they  which  went  before  rebuked  him,  that  he  should  hold  his  peace : 
but  he  cried  so  much  the  more,  Thou  son  of  David,  have  mercy  on  me. 

40  And  Jesus  stood,  and  commanded  him  to  be  brought  unto  him  : and  when 
he  was  come  near,  he  asked  him, 

41  Saying,  What  wilt  thou  that  I shall  do  unto  thee  ? And  he  said,  Lord,  that 
I may  receive  my  sight. 

42  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Receive  thy  sight : thy  faith  hath  saved  thee. 

43  And  immediately  he  received  his  sight,  and  followed  him,  glorifying  God  { 
and  all  the  people,  when  they  saw  it,  gave  praise  unto  God. 

Ver.  1. — And  He  spake  a parable  unto  them  to  the  end  that. 
Christ  had  said,  at  the  end  of  the  last  chapter,  that  the  Apostles  and

the  faithful  should  suffer  persecutions,  in  which  they  should  wish  for 
His  presence  that  they  might  seek  and  receive  help  from  Him.  « He 
now  names  a remedy  for  all  their  sufferings,  prayer,  for  He  both  hears 
them  and  grants  what  they  ask,  for  He  teaches,  directs,  strengthens. 

Always  to  pray . Hence  the  heretics  called  Euchita  wished,  but 
without  reason,  to  be  always  praying  and  to  do  no  manual 
work.  But  it  is  written,  “If  any  man  will  not  work,  neither  let 
him  eat”  (2  Thess.  iii.  10).  “Always”  here  seems  to  mean  sedu- 
lously, perseveringly,  diligently,  assiduously  as  in  other  things, 
and  at  befitting  times,  especially  when  temptation,  persecution,  and 
affliction  are  hard  at  hand.  It  is  impossible  for  us  to  pray  always 
and  at  all  times.  We  must  have  a time  for  eating,  drinking,  labour- 
ing, &c.  The  word  “always”  means,  therefore,  not  continuance 
but  perseverance  in  prayer:  that  is,  that  we  should  set  apart  fit 
times  for  prayer,  and  not  cease  to  pray  until  we  have  obtained  what 
we  need  and  what  we  ask  for.  Our  Lord  adds,  “ and  not  to  faint  ” or 
in  the  Greek  “ be  weary.”  The  reason  is  that  we  daily  meet  so  many 
difficulties  and  troubles  that  our  whole  lives  appear  to  be  one 
temptation  and  warfare.  And  as  we  are  infirm  and  unable  to  over- 
come them  we  ought  to  ask  help  and  strength  from  God  through 
prayer.  Thus  our  whole  Christian  life  seems  as  it  were  one  prayer. 
Again,  “always,”  that  is  frequently,  at  the  hours  appointed  by  the 
Church,  that  we  may  do  nothing  without  prayer — nothing  that  we  do 
not  ascribe  to  the  glory  of  God.  Bede  says,  mystically , “ He  prays 
always  who  works  for  God  always;”  and  the  Gloss,  “He  prays 
always  who  lives  virtuously  always.”  S.  Chrysostom:  “The  Lord 
would  have  you  to  obtain  by  prayer  that  which  He  wishes  to  give 
you.  The  palace  and  the  ears  of  princes  are  open  to  few.  The 
ears  of  God  are  open  to  all  who  will.”  He  refers  to  Ecclus.  xxxv.  20. 
So  the  apostle,  Ephes.  vL  18 ; 1 Thess.  v.  17.  See  what  I have  said 
on  those  three  passages,  Climachus : Gradu  xxviiL  : “ Prayer,  if  we 
regard  its  nature  or  quality,  is  the  familiar  conversation  and  union 
of  man  with  God,  but  if  we  consider  its  force  and  efficacy  it  is  the 
conservation  of  the  world,  our  reconciliation  with  God,  the  mother, 
at  once,  and  daughter  of  tears,  the  propitiation  of  sins,  the  bridge  of

escape  from  temptation,  the  bulwark  against  the  attacks  of  afflictions, 
the  destruction  of  war,  the  office  of  angels,  the  food  of  all  spirits — 
future  joy,  continual  action,  the  fountain  of  virtues,  the  reconciler 
and  authoress  of  divine  graces.1’  Not  content,  he  speaks  more 
highly,  exaltedly,  nobly  still : “It  is  spiritual  progress,  the  food  of 
the  soul,  the  illumination  of  the  mind,  the  axe  of  despair,  the 
demonstration  of  hope,  the  distinction  of  sorrow,  the  wealth  of 
monks,  the  treasure  of  solitaries,  the  decreasing  of  anger,  the  mirror 
of  religious  growth,  the  index  of  our  stature,  the  declaration  of  our 
condition,  the  signification  of  things  future,  the  proof  of  the  glory 
to  come.”  So  the  Church  sings  of  S.  Caecilia : She  always  bore  the 
evangel  of  Christ  in  her  bosom,  and  neither  by  day  nor  by  night  did 
she  cease  from  divine  conversation  and  prayer,  and  when  the  organs 
sounded  Caecilia  sang  to  the  Lord,  “ Cleanse  thou  my  heart,  that  I 
may  not  be  confounded.”  Valerian  her  husband  found  her  on  her 
bed  praying,  with  an  angel.  By  this  increasing  prayer  she  merited 
to  be  given  to  the  angel  for  the  preservation  of  her  virginity,  the 
conversion  of  her  espoused  husband  Valerian,  of  Tiburtius  and  400 
others,  and  lastly  a glorious  martyrdom  with  them  all. 

Ver.  2. — Saying  there  was  in  a city  a judge  which  feared  not  God. 
This  judge  was  wicked,  unjust,  cruel,  and  godless,  one  who  feared 
neither  the  vengeance  of  God,  nor  the  ill-report  of  men,  who  cared 
nothing  for  his  conscience  or  his  character.  For  the  wicked  who 
have  no  fear  of  God  are  often  deterred  by  the  shame  of  men,  from 
confessing  those  acts  for  which  they  are  openly  despised  and  con- 
sidered godless  and  infamous.  But  this  judge  was  moved  by  no 
fear  of  God  or  man,  and  therefore  he  had  arrived,  says  Theophylact, 
at  the  summit  of  all  wickedness. 

Ver.  3. — And  there  was  a widow  in  that  city . Avenge  me,  that  is, 
vindicate  my  right  against  ray  oppressor,  and  free  my  innocence ; 
righteousness,  substance,  and  character,  which  are  brought  to  trial 
by  my  enemy  who  is  powerful,  and  against  whom  I cannot  stand. 
She  did  not  ask  for  vengeance  but  only  for  justice,  that  she  might  be 
delivered  from  the  violence  of  her  adversary  and  get  back  her  own. 

Ver.  4. — And  he  would  not  for  a while.  Partly  from  his  own

wickedness  and  partly  because  he  hoped  for  a great  bribe  from  the 
opponent 

But  afterward  he  said  within  himself  Though  I fear  not  God \ nor 
regard  man , i.e.9  Although  I am  unjust  and  without  scruple  or 
shame,  yet  because  this  widow  is  troublesome  to  me,  I will  avenge 
her  of  her  adversary,  and  give  her  back  her  right,  lest  continually 
(in  novissimo)  coming  she  weary  me  out  (sugillet  me).  The  Syriac 
has  “ omni  tempore  ; ” the  Arabic  “ semper."  Sugillo  is  properly 
to  bruise  the  face  and  make  it  livid  by  blows.  The  Greek  is  foro r#a£«. 
The  metaphorical  meaning  is,  firstly,  to  deafen  the  head  and  ears 
with  noise,  and  many  so  understand  it  The  Syriac  has,  “ Lest  she 
continually  trouble  me."  The  Arabic,  “ Lest  she  be  always  coming 
to  trouble  me.”  S.  Augustine  {Ep.  12 1 to  Proba)  : “ She  moved  the 
unjust  judge  by  her  persistence  to  listen  to  her.  Not  that  he  was 
influenced  by  justice  or  mercy,  but  he  was  overcome  by  weariness.” 
So  Bede,  Euthymius,  Lucas  and  others  from  the  Greek.  “ As  there- 
fore this  widow  by  the  assiduity  and  importunity  of  her  supplications 
conquered  the  judge,  so  do  we  overcome  God.  What  fear  cannot 
effect  prayer  can.  Threats  and  the  fear  of  punishment  have  not 
moved  men  to  justice ; but  when  the  widow  came  as  a suppliant, 
from  a savage  she  made;  the  judge  humane.  What  then  may  we 
not  conjecture  of  a beneficent  God,  if  the  widow  by  her  prayers 
changed  a judge  who  had  been  cruel  before,  into  a humane  one  ? * 
S.  Chrysostom  adds  that  Christ  here  wishes  to  show  that  the  chief 
strength  of  prayer  consists  in  turning  unjust  and  cruel  judges  to 
piety  and  mercy.  Sugillare,  applied  from  the  body  to  the  mind, 
means  to  brand  with  a mark,  to  affect  with  disgrace,  to  accuse. 
Although  this  senseless  judge  regarded  neither  God  nor  man,  he 
feared  for  himself  and  his  office,  lest  he  should  be  deposed  from  his 
judgeship,  and  deprived  of  honour  and  profit ; he  therefore  gave  the 
widow  her  due. 

Allegorically , S.  Augustine  {Lib.  ii.  Quasi.  Evangel,  qu.  45),  says, 
M The  widow  is  the  Church,  which  seems  desolate  until  her  bride- 
groom Christ,  who  now  bears  her  griefs  in  secret,  return  from  heaven 
to  judgment"

In  trope , “The  widow,”  says  Theophylact,  “is  the  soul  which  has 
put  away  her  former  husband.  He  was  hostile  to  her  because  she 
came  to  God.  God  is  a judge  Who  fears  no  one,  and  regards  not  the 
persons  of  men.  The  widow  represents  every  soul  that  is  desolate 
and  afflicted,  and  who  prays  to  the  judge,  that  is  God,  to  be  delivered 
from  her  adversary.  But  because  it  is  incongruous  to  compare  God  to 
the  unjust  and  wicked  judge,  as  Euthymius  rightly  says,  from  S.  Chry- 
sostom, we  should  rather  say  that  it  is  Christ  who  is  here  spoken  of; 
and  not  in  comparison  but  as  concluding  from  the  less  to  the  greater. 
That  is : If  the  unjust  judge  were  overcome  by  the  importunity  of  the 
widow  to  change  injustice  into  justice,  and  give  her  her  rights,  how 
much  rather  should  God  do  this,  who  is  most  just,  nay  who  is  justice 
itself,  punishing  all  injustice?”  So  S.  Augustine  above — S.  Chry- 
sostom and  Theophylact — as  will  be  clearly  shown  on  verse  7. 

Vers.  6,  7. — And  the  Lord  said.  Hear  what  the , &c.  “ God,”  says 
Theophylact,  “ is  the  leader,  the  judge  and  the  vindicator  of  all 
righteousness.”  So  David  on  Psalm  xxxiv.  17,  “The  righteous 
cry,  and  the  Lord  heareth.”  The  Arabic  has,  “ Hear  what  the  unjust 
judge  said ; and  shall  not  God  more  .rightly  avenge  His  own  elect, 
who  cry  to  Him  day  and  night?”  So  Ecclus.  xxxv.  21,  22;  Rev. 
vi.  9,  10,  where  the  souls  of  the  slain  for  Christ  cry  to  God  demand- 
ing vengeance.  They  hear  from  Him  that  they  must  rest  yet  a little 
while  until  the  number  of  their  fellow  servants  is  completed.  See 
what  I have  commented  on  the  place. 

Morally . Behold  how  great  is  the  dignity,  the  need,  and  the  power 
of  prayer.  The  need,  that  by  it  we  may  be  delivered  from  all  the  temp- 
tations and  tribulations  by  which  we  are  every  where,  and  always,  sur- 
rounded. The  dignity,  because  by  means  of  prayer  we  converse  with 
God,  as  do  the  angels.  The  power,  because  by  it  we  overcome 
all  adversities  and  hardships.  “ To  pray  always,”  says  S.  Chrysostom 
(Book  ii.  of  Prayer)  “is  the  work  of  angels,  who,  wholly  intent  upon 
God,  teach  us  while  we  pray  to  forget  our  human  nature,  and  to 
have  no  regard  to  things  present,  but  to  conceive  of  ourselves  as 
standing  in  the  midst  of  angels,  and  performing  the  same  sacrifice 
with  them.”  He  adds,  “ Satan  does  not  venture  to  come  too  near

to  a soul  fortified  by  prayer,  for  he  fears  the  strength  and  fortitude 
which  prayer  confers.  Prayer  supports  the  soul  more  than  food 
supports  the  body.”  And  (Book  L),  “ As  the  sun  gives  light  to  the 
body,  so  does  prayer  to  the  soul.  If  it  be  a loss  to  a blind  man 
not  to  see  the  sun,  how  much  greater  a loss  is  it  to  a Christian  not 
to  pray  assiduously,  nor  to  introduce  the  light  of  Christ  into  his  soul 
by  prayer ! By  it  we  attain  to  this  end,  that  we  cease  to  be  mortal 
and  of  time.  By  nature  we  are  mortal,  but  by  prayer  and  our  life 
with  God,  we  pass  to  the  life  immortal.  For  it  is  inevitable  that 
he  who  holds  communion  with  God,  should  come  out  superior  to 
death  and  to  all  that  is  subject  to  corruption.” 

Ver.  8. — When  the  Son  of  man  cometh.  He  comes  to  the  uni- 
versal judgment,  when  He  will  deliver  His  elect,  whom  He  ordered 
to  be  always  ready  and  eager ; and  to  await  that  day  patiently,  pre- 
paring themselves  for  it  by  prayer  and  good  works.  For  that  day 
will  be  sudden  and  unexpected  like  lightning,  as  He  Himself  has 
said  (chap,  xvil  24).  Christ  gives  the  reason  why  we  should  always 
pray,  and  persevere  in  prayer ; because  from  His  long  absence,  faith 
will  fail  even  in  many  who  believe,  so  that  they  will  either  lose  all 
faith  or  believe  very  feebly,  scarcely  thinking  that  He  will  return  at  all 
Secondly,  Christ  here  gives  the  reason  why  many  are  not  heard  in 
prayer.  Their  faith  begins  to  fail  and  they  do  not  continue  steadfast  in 
prayer,  nor  await  the  coming  of  the  Lord  with  patience  as  they  ought. 

Thirdly,  Theophylact  says,  “ He  rightly  connected  His  words  on 
prayer  with  those  on  faith,  for  the  base  and  foundation  of  all  prayer 
is  faith.  He  declared  at  the  same  time  that  few  would  pray,  for 
faith  would  be  found  in  few.” 

* Christ  says  this  to  add  a fresh  incentive  to  unceasing  prayer,  for 
by  degrees  faith  is  failing  more  and  more,  and  offences  and  persecu- 
tions are  therefore  increasing. 

Shall  He  find  faith — perfect  faith,  that  is  ; faith  formed  by  cer- 
tain confidence  (fiducia)  and  love.  “ This,”  says  S.  Augustine  (j tract 
xxxvl),  “is  scarcely  found  on  earth,  for  the  Church  of  the  faithful 
is  full  of  imperfect  faith,  and  is,  as  it  were,  half  dead.”  Christ  Him- 
self explains  it  so,  S.  Matt.  xxiv.  13.

THE  PHARISEE  AND  THE  PUBLICAN.

This  will  happen  more  especially ; at  the  end  of  the  world  before 
the  coming  of  Christ  to  judgment,  when  men  shall  eat  and  drink 
themselves  over  to  pleasure  and  think  not  of  the  judgment,  as 
Christ  said,  chap.  xvii.  27;  and  S.  Peter,  2 Pet  iiL  3.  That  is, 
Christians  will  deny  that  He  is  coming  to  judgment,  even  when  that 
coming  is  near  at  hand  (2  Peter  iii.  4).  As  if  they  had  said,  “ Nature 
has  made  the  world : the  same  Nature  continues  its  course  in  the 
same  tenor,  and  always  will  continue  it  There  is  no  God  to 
destroy  it : no  Deity  to  judge  us  and  our  works,  and  to  punish 
them.” 

Ver.  9. — And  He  spake  also  this  parable  unto  certain  that  trusted 
in  themselves.  Which,  however,  might  truly  happen,  nay  often  has 
happened,  so  that  it  may  be  historical  The  introduction  to  the 
parable  shows  its  scope  and  the  design  of  its  introduction,  namely, 
to  rebuke  the  supremacy  of  the  Pharisees,  and  their  boasting  and 
contempt  of  other  men. 

In  the  former  parable  Christ  taught  one  condition  of  prayer — 
perseverance.  In  this  He  teaches  another — humility,  for  the  humble 
prayer  is  heard  by  God,  the  proud  one  is  rejected,  as  Ecclus.  xxxv. 
ax.  See  what  has  been  said  thereon.  The  Fathers  thus  connect 
these  words  with  the  preceding  verse,  that  is  with  faith.  S.  Augustine 
(Serm,  xxxvi.),  on  the  words  of  the  Lord  that  faith  is  not  of  the 
proud  but  of  the  humble,  says,  “Christ  subjoins  a parable  on 
humility  as  opposed  to  pride : ” Theophylact,  “ Because  pride  more 
than  other  feelings  vexes  the  minds  of  men,  He  very  frequently 
speaks  of  it : ” The  Gloss,  “ That  no  one,  from  what  has  been  said, 
may  flatter  himself  on  his  knowledge,  or  his  confession  of  faith,” 
Christ  shows  that  our  works,  and  not  our  professions,  will  be  judged 
by  God,  and  amongst  these  He  chiefly  notes  humility. 

Ver.  10. — Two  men  went  up.  The  one  a Pharisee,  with  the  Phari- 
saical pride,  puffed  up  and  haughty.  The  other  a publican,  that  is 
a sinner,  and  deprecating  pardon.  Publicans  were  held  infamous 
by  the  Jews,  nay,  were  termed  Parisim — that  is,  public  robbers,  for, 
as  Suidas  says,  from  Jamblichus,  “ The  life  of  a publican  was  one 
of  open  violence,  on  account  of  their  exactions  and  unjust  tribute,

their  unpunished  robberies,  their  unprincipled  conduct  in  business, 
and  their  unblushing  usury. 

Ver.  ii. — The  Pharisee  stood  and  prayed  thus  within  himself. 
The  Jews  prayed  partly  kneeling  and  partly  standing,  when  their 
prayer  was  longer  than  usual — sacrifice  or  psalmody.  For  in  the 
temple  there  was  no  place  to  sit,  except  for  the  High  Priest  and 
king  alone,  as  I have  showed  on  Ezek.  xlvi.  2.  The  word  “ stand- 
ing ” is  added  here  to  show  the  pride  of  the  Pharisee ; he  raised 
his  head  to  heaven  as  if  to  dispute  with  God,  or  to  claim  and  exact 
the  measure  of  his  merits.  “ For  a humble  man,”  as  Theophylact 
says,  “ is  humble  of  aspect,  but  this  Pharisee  is  seen  to  be  proud 
both  by  his  habit  and  bearing.”  The  Arabic  reads,  “ The  Pharisee 
stood  praying.”  The  Pharisee,  therefore,  stood  proudly:  1.  As 
being  secure  and  confident  in  his  own  merits,  and  as  calling  God 
to  judgment  2.  He  stood  first,  or  among  the  first,  near  the  altar. 
3.  He  stood  with  his  neck  and  face  erect  and  fixed  on  heaven,  as 
if  heaven  were  his  debtor.  The  publican,  however,  stood  1.  Trem- 
bling and  fearful,  confessing  his  sins.  2.  Afar  off,  at  a distance 
from  the  altar,  the  last,  or  among  the  last  3.  With  his  face  cast 
down  towards  the  ground,  not  venturing  to  look  up  to  heaven,  show- 
ing his  fear  and  penitence  by  the  place  in  which  he  stood  and  by 
his  appearance.  Hence  Bede  says,  allegorically , “ The  Pharisee  is 
the  people  of  the  Jews,  exalting  their  merits  by  the  righteousness  of 
the  law.  The  publican  is  the  Gentile  confessing  his  sin  apud  se? 
The  apud  se  of  the  Pharisee  is  referred  in  the  Syriac  to  “ standing,” 
standing  apud  se — relying  on  himself,  trusting  to  himself,  insisting 
on  his  own  merits  and  dwelling  on  them.  The  Syriac  reads 
"serveto.”  Our  version  more  rightly  connects  the  apud  se  with 
“orabat”  He  prayed  with  himself  in  his  soul  and  mind,  for  the 
pride  in  his  heart  so  puffed  him  up,  that  he  would  not  pray  or  speak 
but  with  himself — he  did  not  deign  to  do  so  before  others.  He 
prayed  like  the  Pharisees  outwardly,  in  a grave  inflated  pompous 
tone.  Hence  S.  Basil  on  Isaiah  ii.  says,  “ He  prayed  apud  se  not 
apud  Deum — for  he  acted  like  himself  when  he  fell  into  the  sin 
of  pride*”

PRAYER  OF  THE  PHARISEE.

He  prayed — In  his  own  way,  for  he  did  not  pray  to  God,  but  he 
praised  himself.  S.  Augustine  («m  xxxvi.)  on  the  words  of  the  Lord 
according  to  S.  Luke : “ What  did  he  ask  of  God  ? Seek  from  his 
own  words.  We  find  nothing.  He  went  up  to  pray ; he  would  not 
ask  of  God,  but  preferred  to  please  himself,  and  heap  insults  on  the 
devout  publican  as  well” 

I thank  Thee,  “ He  is  not  blamed,”  said  S.  Augustine  (serm. 
xxxvi.),  “ because  he  gave  thanks,  but  because  he  wished  for  nothing 
to  be  given  to  him.  Whoever  says  * I justify  myself,*  is  worse  than 
the  Pharisee  who  proudly  called  himself  righteous,  but  who  also  gave 
thanks  to  God.” 

“ He  gave  God  thanks,”  says  S.  Bernard  (de  Grad,  Humil,\  “ not 
because  he  was  good,  but  because  he  was  alone : and  not  so  much 
for  the  good  which  he  had  himself,  as  for  the  evil  which  he  saw  in 
others.  He  had  not  cast  out  the  beam  from  his  own  eye,  and  he 
recounts  the  motes  in  his  brothers*  eyes.  For  he  says  ‘unjust* — 
‘extortioners.’” 

I am  not  as  other  men.  He  should  at  least  have  said  “as  many 
others,”  for  what  does  “other”*  mean,  but  all  men  except  himself i 
“ I,”  he  said,  “ am  righteous,  the  rest  are  sinners ; **  that  is,  I alone  am 
righteous,  all  the  rest  are  wicked.  The  proud  man,  to  exalt  himself 
the  more,  especially  despises  and  depreciates  others. 

S.  Gregory  {lib.  xxiil  Moral,  c.  7)  describes  four  species  of  pride 
in  this  Pharisee.  The  first  is,  when  men  think  that  they  have  good, 
e.g.y  virtue  a se.  The  second,  when  they  ascribe  this  to  their  own 
merits.  The  third,  when  they  think  that  they  have  that  which  they 
have  not  The  fourth,  when  they  wish  to  be  singular,  and  therefore 
despise  and  speak  evil  of  others.  The  three  last  of  these  are  clearly 
shown  in  the  proud  and  false  righteousness  of  this  Pharisee.  The 
first  appeared  in  him  because  he  ascribed  his  righteousness,  not  to 
God  but  to  his  own  works,  and  said  of  God,  with  the  Pagan,  “ Let 
God  give  me  strength,  let  Him  give  me  wealth,  I will  order  my 
mind  myself.”  “ If,  in  fine,”  says  Theophylact,  “ he  had  believed 
that  it  was  the  gift  of  God  that  he  had  graces  not  his  own 
(aliena),  he  would  npt  have  held  other  men  in  contempt,  remem-

bering  that  even  he  himself  was  naked  as  far  as  regards  his  own 
virtue.” 

Even  as  this  publican. — “ See,”  says  an  Interlineator  on  S.  Augus- 
tine, 44  how  the  vicinity  of  this  publican  was  the  occasion  of  greater 
pride  to  the  Pharisee.**  The  Syriac  has,  “ Nor  as  this  publican,” 
supply,  “am  I a public  sinner.”  Of  his  pride,  he  judges  rashly  and 
falsely  that  the  publican  was  wicked,  when  in  truth  he  was  a peni- 
tent and  justified.  The  Pharisee  sinned  therefore,  i.  In  judging 
rashly;  a.  In  despising  the  publican;  3.  In  reviling  and  insulting 
him,  for  he  casts  up  to  the  publican  his  sins.  S.  Chrysostom  in  the 
Catena ; “ All  human  nature  did  not  satisfy  his  contempt,  but  he 
attacked  this  publican.  Whoever  reproaches  others,  commits  many 
offences.  1.  He  makes  the  other  worse,  for  if  he  is  a sinner  he  who 
is  rebuked  rejoices  to  find  a partner  in  his  wickedness ; if  righteous, 
he  thinks  highly  of  himself,  a.  He  harms  the  Church ; for  his  hearers 
revile  it  3.  He  causes  God  to  be  blasphemed.  4.  He  makes  the 
other  more  shameless,  and  engenders  hate  towards  his  rebuker.  5. 
He  renders  himself  obnoxious  to  punishment 

S.  Bernard  (de  Gradib.  Humil.) : " The  Pharisee,  while  rejoicing  in 
himself,  insults  other  men  beyond  measure  David  does  otherwise. 
He  says,  1 All  men  are  liars.*  He  excepted  no  one,  lest  he  should 
deceive  him ; for  he  knew  that  all  have  sinned,  and  have  need  of 
the  glory  of  God.  The  Pharisee  deceived  himself  alone,  when  he 
excepted  himself  from  the  common  reproach,  lest  he  should  be 
excepted  from  mercy.  The  Pharisee  makes  light  of  mercy  while  he 
dissembles  his  misery.  The  Prophet  says,  as  well  of  himself  as  of 
all  others,  4 All  men  are  liars.*  The  Pharisee  admits  it  of  all  men 
but  himself.  4 1 am  not,*  he  said,  4 as  other  men.*** 

I fast  thrice  in  the  week.  In  Sabbato.  This  is  by  synecdoche,  the 
chief  day  of  the  week  being  put  for  the  whole  week,  which  is  called 
sabbatum.  Hence  the  Arabic,  44 1 fast  two  days  in  every  week.” 
Theophylact  says  that 44  the  Pharisees  fasted  on  the  second  and  fifth 
days ; ” but  he  gives  no  authority  for  it 

I give  tithes  of  all  that  I possess.  Not  only  of  the  first-fruits  which 
the  law  compels,  but,  for  my  desire  for  a higher  and  a willing  service^

PRAYER  OF  THE  PUBLICAN. 


445 


I give  tithes  of  all  things  whatever,  as  flesh,  eggs,  fish,  to  which  I am 
not  bound  This  Pharisee  had  branded  other  men  as  if  they  were 
adulterers  and  unjust,  while  he  himself  alone  was  pure  and  just  He 
would  prove  himself  pure  by  his  fasts,  which  are  the  mother  of  purity, 
and  to  be  just  by  his  giving  tithes  of  everything.  “As  regards 
impurity,”  says  Theophylact,  “ he  makes  boast  of  his  fasting,  for 
from  luxury  comes  wantonness.  Against  usury  and  injustice  he 
brings  forward  his  giving  tithes  of  every  thing  that  he  possessed.  ‘ So 
far  am  1/  he  said,  4 from  usury  and  unfair  dealing,  that  I put  aside 
what  is  my  own.’”  So  S.  Ephrem,  in  Catena. 

Morally . S.  Gregory  here  observes  {Homily  vil  on  Ezekiel) : “ The 
Pharisee,  who  published  his  fasts  and  gave  tithes,  thanked  God,  as  if 
his  guardianship  were  on  the  watch  throughout  the  circuit  of  his 
whole  city ; but  because  he  had  not  noticed  one  opening,  that  of  pride 
in  himself,  there  the  enemy  took  possession  of  him.  While  therefore 
he  was  silent  on  what  he  ought  to  have  declared,  he  unhappily  spoke 
of  that  on  which  he  should  have  held  his  peace ; and  through  his 
pride,  his  merits,  if  he  had  any,  were  diminished,  for  while  he  held 
humility  in  contempt,  he  augumented  his  sins.” 

Ver.  13. — And  the  publican , standing  afar  off.  The  publican  did 
not  resent  the  insult  offered  by  the  Pharisee,  nay,  he  admitted  it, 
confessed  it,  and  sought  pardon  for  it  with  patience.  He  was  there- 
fore justified  before  the  Pharisee.  S.  Chrysostom,  in  his  Homily  on 
David  and  Saul,  says,  “ The  publican  accepted  the  disgrace  and 
washed  it  out.  He  acknowledged  his  sins,  and  laid  them  down. 
This  accusation  was  to  be  his  remission,  and  his  enemy  was  changed 
involuntarily  into  his  benefactor.  How  many  labours  ought  that 
publican  to  have  undergone,  fasting,  sleeping  on  the  ground,  watch- 
ing, bestowing  his  goods  on  the  poor,  sitting  long  in  sackcloth  and 
ashes,  that  so  he  might  lay  aside  his  sins?  But  when  he  did  none 
of  these  things,  by  a mere  word  he  was  rid  of  all  his  sin ; and  the 
insults  and  reproaches  of  the  Pharisee,  which  seemed  to  overwhelm 
him  with  contumely,  bought  him  a crown  of  righteousness,  and  that 
without  toil,  without  labour,  and  without  long  delay.” 

Standing  afar  off.  Afar  from  the  altar  and  the  holy  place,  for  he

thought  himself  unworthy  of  these  from  his  sins.  He  was  not  so 
very  far  off  though,  but  the  Pharisee  was  able  to  point  to  him,  and 
he  to  hear  the  Pharisee. 

He  would  not  lift  up  so  much  as  his  eyes  unto  heaven.  He  dared 
not,  from  modesty,  humility,  and  reverence.  He  would  not  so  much 
as  lift  his  eyes,  as  if  thinking  himself  unworthy  to  look  to  that  heaven 
which  was  the  abode  of  the  glorious  God,  who  was  offended  at  sins. 
Wherefore  with  eyes  cast  down  to  the  ground,  he  humbled  himself. 
So  S.  Cyril  in  the  Catena . 

S.  Theophylact  gives  the  cause  of  his  thinking  himself  unworthy 
of  the  heavenly  vision ; and  S.  Augustine : “ That  he  might  be  looked 
upon  by  God,  he  looked  not  upon  himself.  He  dared  not  look  up. 
Conscience  weighed  him  down.  Hope  lifted  him  up.  Again  he 
showed  by  his  posture  that  he  had  sinned  against  the  Heavenly  Host, 
that  is  against  the  Angels  whose  inspirations  he  had  resisted ; against 
the  Saints,  whose  prayers  he  had  made  of  no  avail ; against  God  Him- 
self,  whose  commandments  he  had  broken.” 

But  he  smote  on  his  breast  His  breast,  in  which  was  his  heart, 
that  is  his  will,  which  is  its  own  cause  and  origin  of  all  sins.  “ He 
struck  and  beat  it,”  says  Euthymius,  “as  if  to  exact  punishment 
from  it : and  to  show  that  because  of  it  he  was  worthy  himself  of 
stripes.”  The  beating  of  the  breast  is  a sign  of  penitence  and  a con- 
trite heart.  Hence  this  was  formerly  the  act  of  one  who  confessed 
and  was  penitent,  and  it  is  so  stilL  To  beat  the  offending  breast  is 
both  an  ancient  and  modern  custom  of  Christians.  S.  Augustine  in 
his  8th  Sermon  “ On  the  Words  of  the  Lord  according  to  S.  Matt,” 
says,  “ At  this  ‘ Confiteor  ’ you  beat  your  breasts.  What  is  this  but 
to  confess  what  is  lying  hid  in  them,  and  by  a visible  blow  to  chas- 
tise an  invisible  sin  ? Why  do  you  do  this,  but  that  you  hear  * Con- 
fiteor tibi  Pater.*  Therefore  our  accusation  of  ourselves  in  our 
confession  is  the  praising  of  God.  For  we  confess  ourselves  to  be 
sinners,  but  God  to  be  without  sin,  holy  and  good.  We  therefore 
ask  pardon  of  Him.  The  Pharisee,  from  his  proud  and  unreal 
prayer,  was  the  more  defiled  with  sin.  The  oublican  was  more 
righteous  than  the  Pharisee,  not  directly  and  simply,  but  indirectly

and  negatively ; for  indeed  he  was  righteous,  but  the  Pharisee  was 
unrighteous,  and  he  returned  to  his  house  even  more  so  than  he 
came  out”  “For,”  says  Euthymius,  “he  who  so  condemned  him- 
self was  justified  by  God ; ” and  S.  Paulinus  (Eph.  Iviii.),  “ What 
righteousness  built  up,  that  pride  pulled  down.  The  publican, 
from  a contrite  heart,  was  accepted  as  an  accuser  of  himself,  and 
obtained  pardon  from  his  confession  of  sins,  from  the  degree  of  his 
humility;  that  holy  Pharisee  (holy  as  the  Jews  are  holy)  bearing 
away  the  pack-load  of  his  sins  from  his  boast  of  holiness.”  S. 
Bernard  ( serm  iii.  de  Annunc. ):  “The  Pharisee  returned  empty 
because  he  pretended  to  be  full  The  publican,  who  emptied  him- 
self, and  took  pains  to  show  that  he  was  an  empty  vessel,  carried 
away  the  greater  grace.” 

“ Humility,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  “ brought  the  thief  into  Paradise 
before  the  Apostles.  But  if  humility  has  such  power  when  close 
upon  the  offence,  what  can  it  not  do  when  united  to  righteousness  ? 
And  if  pride,  united  to  righteousness,  can  depress,  what  will  it  do 
when  united  to  sin  ? ” “ Better  are  sins  with  humility  than  innocence 
with  pride,”  says  Optatus.  ( Cont \ Donat.  B.  il) 

Ver.  15. — And  they  brought  unto  Him  also  infants , that  He  should 
touch  them.  And  by  touching  might  bless  them.  Christ  confirms 
the  doctrine  of  humility  by  His  own  example.  “ Infants,”  says  the 
Gloss,  “are  brought  to  the  Master  of  Humility,  that  innocence  and 
the  age  of  simplicity  might  be  shown  to  belong  to  grace.” 

Ver.  16. — Suffer  the  little  children  to  come  unto  Me.  The  Arabic : 
“For  the  kingdom  of  God  is  theirs  who  are  like  them”— not  in 
infancy  but  in  innocence,  simplicity,  humility.  So  Bede.  “ He 
does  not  say  theirs,  but  such  as  they,  meaning  their  manner  of  life, 
not  their  age.”  And  S.  Ambrose : “ It  is  not  childhood,  but  the 
goodness  of  that  simplicity  which  emulates  child-like  innocence,  that 
is  meant ; for  it  is  not  a virtue  not  to  be  able  to  sin,  but  not  to 
will  to  do  so.”  I have  explained  the  rest  on  Matt  xix.  13  and 
following. 

Ver.  35. — And  it  came  to  pass  as  He,  &c.  Of  this  blind  man 
restored  to  sight  I have  treated.  Matt.  xx.  30.

CHAPTER  XIX. 

I  Of  Zacchctus  a publican.  1 1 The  ten  pieces  of  money . 28  Christ  ridetk  into 

Jerusalem  with  triumph : 41  iveepeth  over : 45  driveth  the  buyers  and  sellers 
out  of  the  temple : 47  teaching  daily  in  iL  The  rulers  would  have  destroyed 
him,  but  for  fear  of  the  people. 

AND  Jesus  entered  and  passed  through  Jericho. 

2  And,  behold,  there  was  a man  named  Zacchaeus,  which  was  the  chief 
among  the  publicans,  and  he  was  rich. 

3  And  be  sought  to  see  Jesus  who  he  was ; and  could  not  for  the  press,  because 
he  was  little  of  stature. 

4  And  he  ran  before,  and  climbed  up  into  a sycomore  tree  to  see  him  ; for  he 
was  to  pass  that  way. 

5  And  when  Jesus  came  to  the  place,  he  looked  up,  and  saw  him,  and  said 
unto  him,  Zacchaeus,  make  haste,  and  come  down  ; for  to  day  I must  abide  at  thy 
house. 

6  And  he  made  haste,  and  came  down,  and  received  him  joyfully. 

7  And  when  they  saw  it,  they  all  murmured,  saying,  That  he  was  gone  to  be 
guest  with  a man  that  is  a sinner. 

8  And  Zacchaeus  stood,  and  said  unto  the  Lord ; Behold,  Lord,  the  half  of  my 
goods  I give  to  the  poor ; and  if  I have  taken  any  thing  from  any  man  by  false 
accusation,  I restore  him  fourfold. 

9  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  This  day  is  salvation  come  to  this  house,  forsomuch 
as  he  also  is  a son  of  Abraham. 

10  For  the  Son  of  man  is  come  to  seek  and  to  save  that  which  was  lost 
1 1 And  as  they  heard  these  things,  he  added  and  spake  a parable,  because  he 
was  nigh  to  Jerusalem,  and  because  they  thought  that  the  kingdom  of  God  should 
immediately  appear. 

12  He  said  therefore,  A certain  nobleman  went  into  a far  country  to  receive 
for  himself  a kingdom,  and  to  return. 

13  And  he  called  his  ten  servants,  and  delivered  them  ten  pounds,  and  said 
unto  them,  Occupy  till  I come. 

14  But  his  citizens  hated  him,  and  sent  a message  after  him,  saying,  We  will 
not  have  this  man  to  reign  over  us. 

1 5  And  it  came  to  pass,  that  when  he  was  returned,  having  received  the  kingdom, 
.hen  he  commanded  these  servants  to  be  called  unto  him,  to  whom  he  had  given 
the  money,  that  he  might  know  how  much  every  man  had  gained  by  trading. 

16  Then  came  the  first,  saying,  Lord,  thy  pound  hath  gained  ten  pounds. 

17  And  he  said  unto  him,  Well,  thou  good  servant : because  thou  hast  been 
faithful  in  a very  little,  have  thou  authority  over  ten  cities.

1 8 And  the  second  came,  saying,  Lord,  thy  pound  hath  gained  five  pounds. 

19  And  he  said  likewise  to  him,  Be  thou  also  oyer  five  cities. 

20  And  another  came,  saying,  Lord,  behold,  here  is  thy  pound,  which  1 have 
kept  laid  up  in  a napkin : 

21  For  I feared  thee,  because  thou  art  an  austere  man : thou  takest  up  that  thou 
layedst  not  down,  and  reapest  that  thou  didst  not  sow. 

22  And  he  saith  unto  him.  Out  of  thine  own  mouth  will  I judge  thee,  thou 
wicked  servant  Thou  knewest  that  I was  an  austere  man,  taking  up  that  I laid 
not  down,  and  reaping  that  I did  not  sow  : 

23  Wherefore  then  gavest  not  thou  my  money  into  the  bank,  that  at  my  coming 
I might  have  required  mine  own  with  usury  ? 

24  And  he  said  unto  them  that  stood  by,  Take  from  him  the  pound,  and  give 
it  to  him  that  hath  ten  pounds. 

25  (And  they  said  unto  him,  Lord,  he  hath  ten  pounds.) 

26  For  I say  unto  you,  That  unto  every  one  which  hath  shall  be  given ; and 
from  him  that  hath  not,  even  that  he  hath  shall  be  taken  away  from  him. 

27  But  those  mine  enemies,  which  would  not  that  I should  reign  over  them, 
bring  hither,  and  slay  them  before  me. 

28  *f  And  when  he  had  thus  spoken,  he  went  before,  ascending  up  to  Jerusalem. 

29  And  it  came  to  pass,  when  he  was  come  nigh  to  Bethphage  and  Bethany,  at 
the  mount  called  the  mount  of  Olives,  he  sent  two  of  his  disciples, 

30  Saying,  Go  ye  into  the  village  over  against  you  ; in  the  which  at  your  enter- 
ing ye  shall  find  a colt  tied,  whereon  yet  never  man  sat : loose  him,  and  bring 
him  hither. 

31  And  if  any  man  ask  you,  Why  do  you  loose  him  f thus  shall  ye  say  unto 
him,  Because  the  Lord  hath  need  of  him. 

3a  And  they  that  were  sent  went  their  way,  and  found  even  as  he  had  said  unto 
them. 

33  And  as  they  were  loosing  the  colt,  the  owners  thereof  said  unto  them,  Why 
loose  ye  the  colt  ? 

34  And  they  said,  The  Lord  hath  need  of  him. 

35  And  they  brought  him  to  Jesus  : and  they  cast  their  garments  upon  the  colt, 
and  they  set  Jesus  thereon. 

36  And  as  he  went,  they  spread  their  clothes  in  the  way. 

37  And  when  he  was  come  nigh,  even  now  at  the  descent  of  the  mount  of 
Olives,  the  whole  multitude  of  the  disciples  began  to  rejoice  and  praise  God  with 
a loud  voice  for  all  the  mighty  works  that  they  had  seen  : 

38  Saying,  Blessed  he  the  King  that  cometh  in  the  name  of  the  Lord : peace  in 
heaven,  and  glory  in  the  highest. 

39  And  some  of  the  Pharisees  from  among  the  multitude  said  unto  him,  Master, 
rebuke  thy  disciples. 

40  And  he  answered  and  said  unto  them,  I tell  you  that,  if  these  should  hold 
their  peace,  the  stones  would  immediately  cry  out 

41  T And  when  he  was  come  near,  he  beheld  the  city,  and  wept  over  it, 

42  Saying,  If  thou  hadst  known,  even  thou,  at  least  in  this  thy  day,  the  thing? 
which  belong  unto  thy  peace  ! but  now  they  are  hid  from  thine  eyes. 

43  For  the  days  shall  come  upon  thee,  that  thine  enemies  shall  cast  a trench 
about  thee,  and  compass  thee  round,  and  keep  thee  in  on  every  side,

44  And  shall  lay  thee  even  with  the  ground,  and  thy  children  within  thee 
and  they  shall  not  leave  in  thee  one  stone  upon  another ; because  thou  knewest 
not  the  time  of  thy  visitation. 

45  And  he  went  into  the  temple,  and  began  to  cast  out  them  that  sold  therein, 
and  them  that  bought ; 

46  Saying  unto  them,  It  is  written,  My  house  is  the  house  of  prayer : but  ye 
have  made  it  a den  of  thieves. 

47  And  he  taught  daily  in  the  temple.  But  the  chief  priests  and  the  scribes  and 
the  chief  of  the  people  sought  to  destroy  him, 

48  And  could  not  find  what  they  might  do : for  all  the  people  were  very  atten- 
tive to  hear  him. 

Ver.  1. — And  Jesus  entered  and  passed  through  Jericho.  S.  Luke 
continues  the  account  of  the  journey  to  Jerusalem.  I have  spoken 
of  this  in  the  preceding  chapter,  verse  35. 

Ver.  2. — Andy  behold,  there  was  a man  named  Zacchoeus , which  was 
the  chief  among  the  publicans . Christ  gave  sight  to  the  blind  man 
near  Jericho;  soon  after,  in  Jericho  itself,  He  converted  Zacchseus,  for 
no  place,  no  road,  no  moment  of  time  was  idle  to  Christ,  but  all  were 
made  notable  by  divine  jerries,  benefits,  and  miracles,  that  He  might 
teach  us  to  do  the  same.  “ Zacchseus."  This  name  is  as  it  were  an 
omen  of  his  future  righteousness  and  purification,  for  Zacchseus  in 
Hebrew  is  the  same  as  just,  pure,  clear.  The  chiefs  of  the  publicans 
had  many  publicans,  that  is  collectors  of  the  taxes,  under  them. 
These  taxes  the  Romans  and  Tiberius  had  imposed  on  the  Jews 
against  their  will.  Hence  the  publicans  were  hated  by  the  Jews  and 
accounted  infamous,  being  called  Parisim,  that  is,  robbers.  The 
chief  was  called  Gabba ; whence  the  word  Gabella,  the  publicans 
being  called  Gabbaim.  Angelus  Caninus  on  Hebrew  words  in  New 
Testament 

And  he  was  rich.  The  chiefs  of  the  publicans  were  not  appointed 
unless  they  were  rich,  that  they  might  advance  money  to  the  Roman 
ruler  when  he  wanted  it,  and  supply,  in  a great  degree,  the  deficiencies 
of  the  publicans  under  him.  S.  Luke  adds  this  to  show  better  the  grace 
of  Christ  and  the  virtue  of  Zacchseus,  since  he  left  his  great  wealth 
for  the  calling  and  love  of  Christ,  and  distributed  it  among  the  poor. 

Ver.  3. — And  he  sought  to  see.  He  took  pains  to  see  Jesus  in 
person  as  he  had  heard  of  His  reputation  from  th*  fame  of  His

virtues  and  miracles.  For  we  wish  to  see  great  men  and  to  know  them 
in  person.  But  Zacchaeus,  beside  his  natural  wish,  was  impelled 
by  one  above  nature,  the  inspiration  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  He  desired 
to  see  Jesus  that  he  might  be  absolved  of  his  sins  by  Him,  and  be 
justified  and  made  holy.  “He  wished,”  says  S.  Chrysostom  in 
his  Homily  on  Zacchaeus,  “to  know  by  sight  one  whom  he  had 
known  before  in  imagination,  to  see  the  face  of  Him  whom  he  had 
seen  before  in  mind,  to  look  upon  Him  as  present  whom  he  had  never 
seen  do  any  works ; that  the  love  of  Christ  which  he  had  conceived 
in  his  heart  might  be  gratified  to  the  full  by  the  sight  of  his  eyes.” 

Ver.  3. — And  he  could  not  But  he  was  exalted  in  mind.  Many  of 
the  heroes  and  saints  were  men  of  small  stature,  as  I have  shown  in 
Zech.  iv.  10  and  Ecclus.  xi  3,  on  the  words,  “The  bee  is  small  among 
flying  things,  but  her  fruit  is  the  chief  of  sweetest  things.”  It  is  in 
minimis  that  the  supreme  majesty  of  God,  His  glory,  strength,  and 
greatness,  most  clearly  shine  forth.  “ The  crowd,”  says  S.  Cyril,  “ is 
the  confusion  of  a multitude,  which  we  must  climb  above,  if  we  wish 
to  see  Christ”  * 

Ver.  6. — And  he  ran . Mystically,  the  sycamore  is  the  cross  of 
Christ  and  His  doctrine,  which  to  the  Gentiles  and  men  of  this 
world  is  mere  folly,  but  to  Zacchaeus  and  the  faithful  is  the  wisdom 
of  God,  and  the  power  of  God.  1 Cor.  i.  24.  S.  Gregory,  lib.  xxvii. 
Moral. : in  fine, u Let  us  leave  the  wisdom  that  is  hurtful,  that  we  may 
gain  that  which  is  to  our  profit,  &c.  The  dwarf  Zacchaeus  submitted 
himself  to  the  sycamore  tree  and  saw  the  Lord ; for  they  who  choose 
humbly  the  folly  of  the  world,  these  wisely  contemplate  the  wisdom 
of  God.  A multitude  hinders  our  slowness  to  see  God,  for  the 
tumults  of  worldly  cares  so  press  upon  the  infirmity  of  the  human 
mind  that  it  cannot  contemplate  the  light  of  truth.  We  are  wise  to 
ascend  the  sycamore  if  we  retain  in  our  minds,  with  forethought, 
that  foolishness  which  is  received  from  God.” 

Theophylact  speaks  as  follows  : “ We  climb  the  fig-tree ; that  is, 
we  ascend  above  the  allurements  of  pleasure,  which  is  signified  by 
the  fig-tree — we  mount  up  by  Penitence,  but  we  come  down  through 
Humility.”

S.  LUKE,  C.  XIX. 


Ver.  5. — And  when  Jesus  came  to  the  place . Christ  compensates 
the  zeal  of  Zacchaeus  to  see  Him  by  His  full  Exhibition  and  Presence. 
Christ  inspired  Zacchaeus  with  this  ardour  that  He  might  perfect 
him  by  entering  his  house.  Christ  indeed  went  thither  that  He 
might  arouse  this  feeling,  and  by  it  be  received  by  Zacchaeus  as  his 
guest,  and  bring  blessing  and  salvation  to  his  whole  house.  For, 
although  the  Saviour  of  the  world,  He  came  to  sanctify  sinners. 
u Jesus  had  not  heard  the  voice  of  Zacchaeus  inviting  him,”  said 
S.  Ambrose,  “ but  He  had  seen  his  feeling.” 

Christ  therefore  not  only  offered  Himself  to  be  seen  by  Zacchaeus, 
who  wished  to  see  Him,  but  He  also  gave  Himself  to  be  possessed 
by  him,  and  therefore  chose  to  remain  in  his  house,  rather  than  in 
the  house  of  any  one  else. 

Moraliter.  Let  us  learn  to  desire  Christ  and  His  inner  conversa- 
tion and  grace,  for  Christ  will  soon  offer  Himself  to  us,  and  fulfil 
our  desire,  and  as  much  as  is  that  desire  will  be  His  conversation ; 
for  Wisdom,  that  is  Christ,  will  meet  him  who  fears  and  longs  for 
God.  “ As  a mother  shall  she  meet  him,  with  the  bread  of  under- 
standing shall  she  feed  him,  and  give  him  the  water  of  wisdom  to 
drink.*1  Ecclus.  xv.  2,  3.  And  chap,  xxiv.,  “ Come  unto  me,  all  ye 
that  be  desirous  of  me,  and  fill  yourselves  with  my  fruits.  For  my 
memorial  is  sweeter  than  honey,”  v.  19,  20 ; and  John  viL  37,  38. 

Zacchaeus,  then,  saw  Christ  with  the  eyes  and  sight  of  his  body, 
and  still  more  with  those  of  his  mind,  by  which  Christ  enlightened 
his  soul  to  discern  that  he  was  the  Saviour  who  would  forgive  the 
sins  of  those  who  repent,  and  give  them  salvation,  that  is,  righteous- 
ness, grace,  and  glory.  The  countenance  of  Jesus  therefore  is  not 
fruitless,  and  of  no  effect,  but  efficacious  and  operative.  For  by 
this  alone  He  attracts  men  to  His  love,  changes  them,  and  brings 
them  to  salvation.  Hence,  says  S.  Cyril,  “ Jesus  saw  the  mind  of 
Zacchaeus  striving  very  earnestly  after  a holy  life.” 

For  to  day  I must  abide  at  thy  house  “ Zacchaeus,”  says  Titus, 
“ wished  only  for  the  sight  of  Jesus,  but  He  who  knows  how  to  do 
more  than  we  ask,  gave  him  what  was  beyond  his  expectation ; for 
Christ  of  His  great  bounty  exceeds  the  prayers  and  powers  of  the

petitioners.”  “ Christ  promised,”  says  S.  Chrysostom  in  his  homily 
on  Zacchaeus,  “ that  He  would  come  to  his  house,  whose  soul  and 
its  desires  He  already  possessed.” 

Ver.  6. — And  he  made  haste , and  came  down — see  the  prompt 
obedience  of  Zacchaeus,  which  deserved  salvation — and  received  Him 
gladly \ Zacchaeus  received  Christ  into  his  house,  and  Christ  in 
return  bestowed  on  him  salvation.  “Zacchaeus  rejoiced,”  says 
Euthymius,  “because  he  had  not  only  seen  Christ,  according  to  his 
wish,  but  because  he  had  also  been  called  by  Him,  and  had  received 
Him  as  his  guest,  a thing  he  had  never  hoped  for.” 

Ver.  7. — And  when  they  saw  it,  they  all  murmured.  (“  All  ” — the 
Pharisees,  and  the  Jews  their  parasites,  who  hated  the  publicans.) 
They  murmured,  saying  that  he  was  gone , &c. 

The  publicans  were  held  by  the  Jews  to  be  impious,  unjust, 
wicked,  and  they  often  were  such.  Some  think  that  “ sinner  ” here 
means  that  Zacchaeus  was  a Gentile  and  idolater.  Such  is  the 
opinion  of  Tertullian,  SS.  Cyprian,  Ambrose,  Bede,  and  from  them 
Maldonatus.  And  that  Zacchaeus  speaks  of  a restitution  of  things 
exacted  so  unjustly,  which  was  of  a natural  law,  and  not  ordered  by 
Moses.  S.  Chrysostom,  in  his  sermon  on  Zacchaeus,  says,  “ He  was 
a son  of  Abraham  by  faith,  not  by  birth ; by  merit,  not  by  descent ; 
by  devotion,  not  by  race.”  But  the  contrary  is  equally  probable, 
perhaps  more  so,  namely,  that  Zacchaeus  was  a Jew,  not  a Gentile. 
1.  Because,  ver.  9,  he  is  called  a son  of  Abraham.  2.  Because 
Christ  only  conversed  with  Jews,  for  He  was  sent  to  the  lost  sheep  of 
the  house  of  Israel  Hence  He  is  called  by  S.  Paul  “ minister  of  the 
circumcision,”  Rom.  xv.  8.  3.  Because  Zacchaeus  is  a Hebrew 

name.  4.  Because  the  Jews  would  not  have  been  silent  on  the 
matter  but  would  have  brought  it  against  Jesus  that  he  held  com- 
munion with  the  Gentiles  when  the  Messiah  was  promised  to  the 
Jews  alone. 

Ver.  8. — And  Zacchaus  stood \ and  said  unto  the  Lord.  We  cannot 
doubt  that  Christ  as  soon  as  He  entered  the  house  of  Zacchaeus  began, 
according  to  His  custom,  to  teach  and  exhort  both  Zacchaeus  himself 
and  those  of  his  household,  to  faith  and  repentance,  and,  if  they

repented,  to  promise  them  grace,  righteousness,  and  salvation.  He 
would  also  urge  upon  them  contempt  of  riches  and  the  world,  and 
the  acceptance  of  poverty  and  evangelical  perfection,  by  following 
Him  and  giving  their  goods  to  the  poor,  that  they  might  receive 
treasure  in  heaven,  and  a hundredfold  in  this  life.  S.  Luke,  for 
the  sake  of  brevity,  says  nothing  of  this ; but  from  what  follows,  and 
from  what  he  had  frequently  said  before,  especially  xviii.  22,  of  the 
custom  of  Christ  to  teach  and  preach,  He  leaves  it  to  be  understood. 
For  by  these  words  of  Christ  Zacchseus  was  plainly  converted  to  faith, 
repentance,  poverty,  and  contempt  of  riches  and  the  world.  He  said. 

Behold , Lord,  the  half  of  my  goods  I give  to  the  poor.  He  therefore 
did  not  keep  one  half  for  himself  but  gave  back  to  others  what  they 
had  been  unjustly  defrauded  of.  For  he  adds,  “ If  I have  wronged 
any  man  of  any  thing,  I restore  him  fourfold.”  " I give,”  “ I restore,” 
that  is,  I am  resolved  from  this  time,  and  firmly  determine  to  give 
and  restore  according  to  Thy  doctrine  and  exhortation.  On  account  of 
this  efficacious  resolution  of  the  penitent  Zacchseus,  Christ  added  as  a 
reward,  “ This  day  is  salvation  come  to  this  house.”  So  S.  Ambrose, 
Bede,  Euthymius,  Tertullian  in  his  fourth  book  against  Marcion, 
Fulgentius  in  his  epistle  to  Galla.  It  is  a Hebraism,  similar  to  that 
of  Pharaoh,  Exod.  v.  10 : “ I give  you  not  straw,”  that  is,  I decree 
and  command  that  straw  is  not  given  to  you.  Matt  xxvL  18:  “I 
will  keep  the  Passover  at  thy  house,”  that  is,  I will,  I determine  to 
keep  it.  S.  Cyprian,  however,  in  his  tract  On  Works  and  Almsgiving, 
has  explained  the  words  “ give  * and  “ restore,”  by  the  perfect  tense : 
“ I have  given,  I have  restored,”  as  if  Zacchseus  had  been  converted 
previously  by  other  discourses  of  Christ  which  he  had  heard. 

And  if  I have,  &c.  The  Greek  is  f*vxo<£4rri j<ra,  that  is,  accused  falsely 
of  fraud,  calumny,  or  any  other  like  offence.  Zacchseus  owns  to  the 
crime  of  defrauding,  but  in  a slight  degree : for  when,  for  the  sum 
defrauded  he  restored  fourfold  out  of  his  own  half  of  his  property,  it 
follows  that  he  gained  only  an  eighth  part  of  his  wealth  by  fraud ; so 
that,  if  he  had  eight  thousand  gold  pieces,  only  one  thousand  was 
gained  thus,  the  other  seven  being  his  own,  either  by  inheritance,  or 
some  other  just  manner.

ZACCHAEUS  DECLARES  HIS  HONESTY. 


455 


Observe  the  sudden  and  miraculous  conversion  of  Zacchaeus, 
through  the  grace  of  Christ,  so  that  he  not  only  repented  at  once, 
but  also  resolved  to  put  away  all  the  wealth  to  which  he  had  pre- 
viously clung,  for  he  set  apart  half  for  the  poor  and  half  for  restitu- 
tion. Thus  he  instantly  embraced  the  precept  of  evangelical  poverty, 
that  he  might  forsake  all  things,  and,  as  a poor  man,  follow  the  work 
of  his  hands.  “ Hear  a wonderful  thing,”  says  S.  Chrysostom,  in  his 
Homily  on  Zacchaeus,  “ He  had  not  yet  learnt,  and  he  obeyed.  The 
Saviour  by  the  rays  of  His  righteousness,  put  to  flight  the  darkness 
of  Zacchaeus*  wickedness.**  And  Bede,  “ Behold,  the  camel  has  laid 
down  his  burden,  and  passed  through  the  eye  of  the  needle — that  is, 
he  gave  up  the  love  of  riches,  and  received  the  blessing  of  the  Lord’s 
adoption.  This  is  the  folly  which  is  wisdom,  and  which  the  publican 
chose  from  the  sycamore  as  the  fruit  of  life ; restoring  what  he  had 
seized,  giving  up  his  own,  despising  things  seen.**  And  Theophy- 
lact,  “ Behold  his  alacrity ; he  began  to  sow  not  sparingly,  nor  did 
he  give  a few  things  but  his  whole  life.**  And  S.  Bernard  (Serm.  i, 
on  Festival  of  all  Saints),  addressing  his  own  Religious  : “ Zacchaeus, 
whose  praise  is  in  the  Gospel,  gave  the  half  of  his  goods  to  the  poor, 
but  I see  here  many  Zacchaeuses,  who  have  left  themselves  nothing 
of  all  their  property.  Who  shall  write  a gospel  of  these  Zacchaeuses, 
nay,  of  these  Peters — who  shall  say  in  faith,  ‘ Lord,  behold,  we  have 
left  all  things  and  followed  Thee?*  But  it  is  written  in  the  ever- 
lasting gospel ; it  is  written  and  signed  in  the  book  of  life,  * Blessed 
are  the  merciful,  for  they  shall  obtain  mercy.*  **  “ I restore,**  that  is,  I 
determine  and  firmly  resolve  to  restore;  nor  can  we  doubt  that  he  acted 
at  once  upon  this  resolve,  and  carried  it  out  into  actual  practice. 

Fourfold.  It  was  not  by  the  law  of  nature,  nor  by  that  of 
Moses,  that  Zacchaeus  bound  himself  to  restore  fourfold ; as  both 
only  oblige  him  to  restore  the  original  sum.  He  resolved  to  perform 
this  great  and  superabundant  act  of  restitution  and  justice  of  his 
fervent  charity  and  repentance.  This  is  in  conformity  with  the  law 
of  Exodus  xxiL  i,  which  orders  that  a man  who  has  stolen  a sheep, 
should  be  condemned  by  the  judge  to  restore  fourfold.  Zacchaeus 
said  this,  not  from  boasting  and  ostentation,  but  partly  from  the

fervour  with  which  he  had  been  inspired  by  Christ  and  the  Holy 
Ghost,  partly  to  refute  the  calumny  of  the  scribes,  who  objected  to 
Christ,  that  He  associated  with  a sinner.  For  he  shows  that  he  was 
now  no  longer  a sinner,  but  repentant  and  just — nay,  more  just  than 
the  just  and  holy. 

In  trope,  S.  Chrysostom  (. Horn . lxxviiL)  teaches  us  that  we  must 
adorn  the  house  of  our  souls  with  almsgiving  and  righteousness, 
like  Zacchseus,  if  we  desire  to  receive  Christ  as  a guest 

Ver.  9. — And  Jesus  said  unto  him . In  answer  to  his  words, 

but  so  that  he  might  appear  to  direct  His  face  and  voice  not 
so  much  to  him,  as  to  the  disciples  and  the  multitude  who 
stood  by.  There  is  a like  enallage  in  Rom.  x.  2 ; Ps.  iii.  3,  and 
elsewhere. 

This  day  is  salvation  come  to  this  house . “ Condemnation,”  says 

Euthymius,  “ which  used  to  inhabit  there,  from  its  avarice  having  been 
turned  out”  The  Arabic  has  “This  day  is  salvation  come  to  the 
dwellers  in  this  house.”  “To  this  house.”  From  this  it  appears 
that  when  Zacchseus  believed  and  was  converted,  all  his  household 
followed  his  example,  and  believed  in  Christ,  repented,  and  were 
justified  and  sanctified.  Moreover,  Zacchseus  after  his  conversion,  and 
the  Resurrection  and  Ascension,  became  an  attendant  of  S.  Peter, 
and  was  ordained  by  him  Bishop  of  Csesarea  in  Palestine.  S.  Clim. 
Recognitions,  lib.  i.  3. 

Forsomuch  as  he  also  is  a son  of  Abraham.  Because  he  followed 
the  faith,  righteousness,  and  holiness  of  Abraham.  For  by  suffering, 
says  Bede,  he  left  his  goods  to  the  poor,  as  Abraham  left  his  country 
and  his  father’s  house.  It  is  said  “ he  also,”  to  show  that  not  only  the 
just  but  those  also  who  repent  of  injustice,  pertain  to  the  sons  of 
promise.  So  Tertullian  (Bk.  iv.  against  Maroon),  Cyprian,  and  others 
cited  above.  S.  Chrysostom,  in  his  Homily  on  Zacchseus,  vol  iL : 
“Zacchseus  made  an  offering  of  all  he  had,  reserving  part  of  his  patri- 
mony for  the  restitution  of  what  he  had  gained  by  fraud.  Abraham 
offered  his  son  to  the  Lord,  Zacchseus  his  substance.  Abraham 
gave  his  heir,  Zacchseus  his  inheritance.  Abraham  displayed  his 
only  pledge  for  an  offering,  Zacchseus  sacrificed  the  substance  of  his

property.  Thus  Zacchaeus  is  rightly  termed  the  son  of  Abraham, 
for  he  followed  the  course  of  his  father’s  glory. 

Again,  Zacchaeus  was  a son  of  Abraham,  because  he  was  a Jew, 
and  a descendant  of  Abraham.  As  if  Christ,  when  the  Pharisees 
murmured  at  His  consorting  with  Zacchaeus,  a publican,  had  answered 
them,  “You  have  no  cause  to  murmur,  for  Zacchaeus  is  an  Israelite, 
and  in  his  ancestor  and  father  Abraham  he  has  the  closest  right  to 
the  Messiah  and  salvation.  Thus  he  has  no  right  to  be  neglected 
by  Me,  who  am  that  Messiah,  because  he  is  a publican ; but  because 
he  is  a penitent,  he  ought  to  receive  my  adoption  and  blessing.” 

Bede,  in  allegory  and  trope , thus  applies  each  part  of  this  history 
to  the  faithful  and  holy:  “Zacchaeus,  that  is,  pure  and  justified, 
signifies  a faithful  people  of  the  Gentiles  who,  when  depressed  by 
temporal  occupations,  and  of  no  account,  wished  to  see  Christ  enter 
Jericho ; that  is  to  share  in  the  faith  which  Christ  brought  to  the 
world.  The  multitude  is  the  habit  of  vices,  which,  when  it  opposed 
him,  he  overthrew  by  relinquishing  earthly  things,  and  ascending 
the  tree  of  the  cross.  The  sycamore  is  a tall  tree,  and  hence  it  is 
called  lofty,  and  the  foolish  fig,  guxjj — a.  It  is  indeed  derided 
by  the  unbelieving  as  a foolish  cross,  but  it  sustains  the  believer  as 
a fig.  The  man  of  small  stature  climbs  it,  when  the  humble  cries 
out,  * far  be  it  from  me  to  glory,  save  in  the  cross  of  Christ’  The 
Lord  therefore  comes,  that  is,  through  His  preachers,  to  the  people 
of  the  nations.  He  sees,  that  is  He  chooses,  through  grace.  He 
remains  in  the  house  of  the  dwarf  Zacchseus,  that  is,  He  rests  in  the 
hearts  of  humble  nations.  Zacchseus  descends  from  the  sycamore, 
for  although  we  have  known  Christ  according  to  the  flesh,  yet  we  do 
not  know  Him  now.  Although  He  died  through  infirmity,  yet  He  is 
alive  now  from  the  power  of  God.”  The  Church  rightly  reads  this 
gospel  of  Zacchaeus  at  the  consecration  of  churches.  Firstly,  because 
Christ  says  in  it,  “ This  day  is  salvation  come  to  this  house  ” — words 
that  are  rightly  applied  to  the  churches  when  they  are  consecrated. 
For  the  dedication  is,  as  it  were,  the  salvation  of  the  church.  The 
church  is  consecrated  to  the  salvation  of  many  who  are  to  be  justi- 
fied in  it  by  preaching,  prayer,  contrition,  confession,  and  absolution.

Again,  Christ  says,  “To-day  I must  abide  in  thy  house.”  In  like 
manner  Christ  abides  in  a consecrated  church,  through  the  venerable 
sacrifice  and  sacrament  of  the  Eucharist  For  by  consecration  a 
church  is  made  the  abode  and  home  of  Christ  Thirdly,  the 
material  is  a type  of  the  spiritual  Church,  that  is,  of  the  faithful  soul, 
in  which  Christ  more  especially  desires  to  abide,  for  He  wished  to 
dwell  in  the  soul,  even  more  than  in  the  house  of  Zacchseus,  accord- 
ing to  the  words,  “Your  body  is  a temple  of  the  Holy  Ghost, 
which  is  in  you.  Glorify  God  therefore  in  your  body.”  i Cor.  vi 
19,  20. 

Ver.  10. — For  the  Son  of  Man  is  come  to  seek  and  to  save.  It 
is  not  wonderful  that  Christ  converted  and  saved  Zacchseus,  and 
publicans  and  sinners,  for,  to  this  He  had  been  sent  by  the  Father, 
and  to  this  He  Himself  had  come  into  the  world.  As,  then,  the 
skill  of  the  physician  is  shown  in  healing  inveterate,  hopeless,  and 
desperate  diseases,  so  the  supreme  virtue  of  Christ,  the  Arch-physician, 
shone  out  in  curing  those  diseases  of  the  soul,  which  by  nature  are 
incurable,  like  avarice  in  publicans.  Thus  He  drew  Zacchseus,  the 
publican,  not  only  to  despise  avarice  and  all  wealth,  but  to  embrace 
evangelical  poverty.  In  the  same  way  He  called  the  publican  and 
made  him  an  Apostle.  The  history  of  Peter  the  Publican  or  Telonarius, 
who  gave  up  all  his  wealth,  and  caused  himself  to  be  sold  for  a slave, 
and  the  money  to  be  given  to  the  poor,  is  a further  case  in  point 

Ver.  11. — And  as  they  heard  these  things.  Christ  had  made  fre- 
quent mention  of  His  kingdom,  and  had  promised  it  to  His  followers. 
The  Apostles  hoped,  therefore,  that  it  would  be  brought  to  pass  now, 
as  He  was  going  to  Jerusalem,  and  that  they  as  His  friends  would 
share  in  it,  and  reign  with  Him  among  the  first  The  fame  and 
glory  of  Christ,  which  had  shone  forth  with  so  much  brightness  and 
brilliance  from  His  recent  miracles,  and  especially,  the  stupendous 
conversion  of  Zacchseus,  increased  this  hope,  from  which,  as  Jesus 
was  entering  Jerusalem  a little  after,  the  Apostles  set  Him  upon  an 
ass,  and  cried  to  the  same  multitude,  as  if  He  were  the  Messiah  and 
the  King,  about  to  be  inaugurated  in  Jeusalem,  “Blessed  is  the 
kingdom  of  our  father  David  which  cometh” — “Blessed  be  the

King  who  cometh  in  the  name  of  the  Lord.”  Ver.  38.  Christ,  there- 
fore, to  disabuse  them  of  this  opinion,  spoke  the  following  parable, 
by  which  He  signified  that  He  must  first  be  put  to  death  by  the 
Jews,  and  rule  by  faith  throughout  the  whole  world. 

Ver.  12. — He  said  therefore,  A certain  nobleman.  Syriac,  “The  son 
of  a great  stock.”  This  nobleman  is  Christ  in  His  human  nature. 
For  as  S.  Basil  says  in  the  Catena,  Christ  is  noble  not  only  in  His 
Godhead,  but  also  in  His  human  nature,  for  He  is  of  the  seed  of 
David,  according  to  that  which  Daniel  saw  and  heard.  “ He  gave 
to  Him  power,  and  honour,  and  a kingdom.”  Eusebius  adds,  on 
this,  “ He  does  not  call  Himself  a king  as  yet,  because  in  His  first 
coming  He  did  not  discharge  the  duties  of  a king.”  For  although 
this  kingdom  was  due  to  Christ  from  the  beginning,  because  of  His 
Hypostatical  Union  with  the  Word,  yet  He  willed  to  merit  it  only  by 
His  passion  and  death  on  the  Cross,  and  not  to  enter  upon  the  posses- 
sion of  it  till  after  His  resurrection,  according  to  the  words  in  chap, 
xxiv.  26.  Christ  therefore  went  into  a far  country  when,  on  the 
fortieth  day  from  His  death  and  resurrection,  He  went  up  into 
heaven,  where  He  entered  upon  His  kingdom,  that  He  might  thus 
be  the  King  of  the  whole  world  ; and  rule  alike  upon  earth  and  in 
heaven.  So  Theophylact,  Titus,  Euthymius,  and  others.  Christ 
therefore  shall  return  from  heaven  to  earth  on  the  day  of  judgment, 
firstly,  to  show  His  kingdom  visibly  to  all  men ; secondly,  to  take 
final  judgment,  as  well  on  His  elect  as  on  the  reprobate,  and  those 
who  are  unbelieving  and  disobedient ; thirdly,  to  bring  His  elect  into 
His  heavenly  kingdom,  and  make  them  partakers  of  His  glory,  as 
the  Angels  on  His  ascension  declared  to  the  Apostles,  Acts  i.  11. 
Christ  shall  then  return,  that  He  may  unite  the  kingdom  of  earth  to 
the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  show  Himself  the  Lord  of  earth  and 
heaven,  and  remove  His  faithful  from  earth  to  His  kingdom  in 
heaven. 

Ver.  13. — And  he  called,  &c.  That  you  may  increase  my  gain  and 
your  own.  “ Ten,”  that  is  all  his  servants,  for  he  gave  to  each  man  a 
mna  as  appears  from  what  follows.  Christ  would  have  us  con- 
tinually traffic  with  the  “mnas,”  that  is  His  talents,  gifts,  graces.

which  He  has  given  us,  that  we  may  assiduously  increase  our  gain 
of  works  and  merits.  He  forbids  us  therefore  to  be  idle ; so  that 
our  whole  life  ought  not  to  be  one  of  ease,  but  of  continual  trading 
in  spiritual  gain,  which,  says  S.  Gregory  to  Dominicus  (lib.  1 Ep . 39), 
“ we  truly  carry  on,  if  by  our  lives  and  words  we  bring  profit  to  the  souls 
of  our  neighbours ; if  by  preaching  the  joys  of  heaven  we  strengthen 
the  feeble  in  the  love  of  things  heavenly ; if  we  bow  down  the  bold 
and  haughty  by  inflexibly  proclaiming  the  punishments  of  Gehenna : if 
we  spare  no  man  for  Truth’s  sake : if,  given  up  to  heavenly  friendships, 
we  fear  no  human  enmity.”  He  adds,  “ But  I fear  the  burthen  of 
my  weakness  for  this  work.  I see  Him  when  He  has  received  His 
kingdom,  returning  and  bringing  me  to  account,  and  with  what 
heart  shall  I endure  His  presence,  to  whom,  in  return  for  the  work 
I have  undertaken,  I bring  no  gain  of  souls,  or  almost  none?” 
This  he  says.  As  much  more  humble,  so  much  greater. 

Ver.  14. — But  his  citizens  hated  him , and  sent . The  Syriac,  “The 
sons  of  his  state:”  The  scribes  and  Jews,  that  is,  hated  Jesus, 
because  He  taxed  them  with  their  vices,  and  they  sent  an  embassage 
after  Him,  saying,  “we  will  not  have  this  man  (Jesus,  who  was 
poor,  of  small  account,  and  the  son  of  a carpenter)  to  rule  over  us.” 
This  was  fulfilled  after  the  death,  resurrection,  and  ascension  of 
Jesus  Christ  into  heaven  when  they  sent  Saul  to  Damascus  to  take 
all  who  believed  in  Christ,  and  root  out  His  faith,  name,  and 
kingdom.  The  same  took  place  when  the  same  men  shut  up  S. 
Peter  and  the  Apostles  in  prison,  and  scourged  them,  and  when 
they  stoned  S.  Stephen,  and  slew  S.  James,  and  persecuted  the  rest 
of  the  Christians,  and  still  persecute  them. 

Ver.  15. — And  it  came  to  pass . The  Syriac  and  Arabic,  “And 
when  He  had  received  the  kingdom  and  returned.”  “ This  part  of 
the  parable,”  says  Euthymius,  “is  about  the  second  advent,  when 
He  shall  return  with  great  power  and  glory,  and  sit  upon  the  throne 
of  His  glory,  for  He  shall  then  take  account  and  render  to  every 
man  according  to  his  work.”  So  S.  Augustine,  Theophylact,  Bede, 
and  others.  I have  explained  the  rest,  Matt  xxv.  19.

field,  by  its  power  sucks  up  juice  from  the  earth,  and  converts  it 
into  itself,  and  produces  ten,  nay,  thirty  and  sixty  seeds  and  grains 
of  wheat  The  Arabic  has,  “Thy  mna  has  gained  ten.”  He  did 
not  say,  “ I have  gained,”  but,  " thy  mna,”  because,  granted  that 
the  freedom  and  co-operation  of  our  wills  concur  to  a good  work, 
still,  the  whole  working  is  of  divine  grace,  and  not  of  our  will,  for 
the  work  only  has  it  from  our  will  that  it  is  free ; but  it  has  it  from 
grace,  that  it  is  supernatural,  pleasing  to  God,  and  meritorious. 
Hence  S.  Paul,  1 Cor.  xv.  10. 

Ver.  17. — And  he  said  unto  him , Well . That  is,  for  one  mna 
thou  shalt  receive  a thousand  and  a thousand,  nay  the  government 
of  one  Province  or  Decapolis,  ten  cities  or  more.  That  is,  for  a 
little  labour  and  care  on  earth  thou  shalt  receive  great,  nay,  the  very 
greatest  ineffable  rewards  in  heaven,  and  shalt  especially  precede 
those  on  whom  thou  hast  expended  the  gifts  of  God  on  earth,  and 
whom  thou  hast  converted  to  Christ  or  hast  moved  to  His  faith  and 
goodness.  S.  Ambrose  gives  the  reason : “ As  the  angels  are  pre- 
ferred to  be  first,  so  are  they  also  who  have  merited  the  life  of 
angels.” 

And  Bede  more  concisely : 11  Be  it  so  that  thou  receivest  power 
over  ten  cities,  that  is,  thou  shalt  have  more  abundant  happiness  and 
honour  in  the  heavens,  and  shalt  be  glorified  above,  for  all  and  by 
all  to  whom  thou  hast  been  a fellow-worker  in  their  salvation.  For 
even  after  the  judgment  there  will  an  order  of  dignity,  and  fitting 
mutual  honour  among  the  blessed.”  Hence  the  words  of  the 
Apostle,  1 Thess.  ii  19. 

Ver.  18. — And  the  second  camey  saying.  Here  is  shown  the  use  of 
free  will,  and  how  much  is  effected  by  its  strenuous  co-operation 
with  grace.  For  the  first  servant  by  this  means  gained  ten  mnas 
from  one,  but  this  one,  by  less  diligence  and  labour  from  one,  gained 
only  five. 

Ver.  19. — And  he  saidy  &c.  “ According  to  the  measure  of  each 

one’s  diligence,”  says  Euthymius,  “ are  honour  and  reward  measured 
out  to  him.”

“ I give  it  back  to  thee,  whole,  but  without  gain  or  increase.”  “ To 
tie  up  money  in  a napkin,”  says  Bede,  “ is  to  hide  our  gifts  under 
the  idleness  of  a lifeless  torpor.” 

Yer.  27. — But  those  mine  enemies  (the  Jews,  His  citizens,  who 
would  not  have  Him  to  reign  over  them)  bring  them  hither — to  my 
Tribunal,  in  the  valley  of  Jehosaphat  and  Jerusalem — and  kill  them 
before  Me?  In  the  Greek,  “ Kill  them  before  my  face.”  Our  Lord 
alludes  to  those  victorious  kings  who  slew  and  destroyed  their  con- 
quered rebels.  By  this  destruction  Christ  signifies  the  extreme  judg- 
ment of  the  Jews  and  His  other  enemies,  and  their  own  condemnar 
tion  to  eternal  death  in  Gehenna,  and  that  a living  and  vital  death, 
where  they  will  be  perpetually  tormented  by  death-dealing  flames, 
and  yet  will  never  die.  Our  Lord  alludes  to  Titus,  who  slaughtered 
the  conquered  Jews.  He  describes  precisely  to  the  letter  the  con- 
demnation of  the  Jews,  and  the  Gehenna  which  He  has  appointed 
for  them  when  He  shall  return  from  heaven  to  judge  and  condemn 
them  and  the  reprobate. 

Ver.  28. — And  when  He  had  thus  spoken.  He  went.  From 
Jericho  and  the  house  of  Zacchaeus,  going  up  to  Jerusalem,  that  He 
might  here  begin  to  fulfil  His  own  words  as  to  His  Passion,  Cross, 
Death,  consequent  Resurrection,  Kingdom,  Glory,  and  Judgment 
He  preceded  the  Apostles  in  this  journey,  which  they  abhorred,  as 
their  Leader  and  Captain,  to  show  them  that  He  could  go  cheerfully 
and  bravely  to  death,  nay  even  as  if  He  were  about  to  provoke 
death  to  a conflict : for  He  was  about,  through  death,  to  go  to  a far 
distant  country,  namely  to  heaven,  to  possess  a celestial  and  eternal 
kingdom. 

Ver.  37. — To  praise  God  with  a loud  voice  (saying,  Hosanna  to  the 
Son  of  David,  Matt,  xxl  9)  for  all  the  mighty  works  they  had  seen. 
Chiefly  the  resurrection  to  life  of  Lazarus,  for  it  was  because  of  this 
that  the  multitude  came  to  meet  Him.  John  xil  18.  So  Bede. 

Ver.  38. — Saying,  Blessed  be  the  King  that  someth  in  the  name  of  the 
Lord.  That  is,  our  King,  the  Messiah  or  Christ,  who  was  sent  by 
God  to  save  us  and  give  us  His  blessing. 

Peace  in  heaven . That  through  Christ  we  may  have  peace  with

God  and  the  angels,  who  are  offended  at  our  sins,  and  therefore 
glory  on  high,  to  Him  who  dwells  in  the  heavens.  “ He  is  called 
the  King,”  says  Bede,  “ not  to  exact  tribute  or  to  arm  a host,  and 
visibly  destroy  His  enemies,  but  because  He  rules  our  souls  and 
leads  us  up  into  heaven.”  “ Because,”  he  adds,  “Christ  shone 
forth  in  the  flesh  as  the  Propitiation  of  the  whole  world.  Rightly 
therefore  the  Heavenly  Host,  that  is  the  angels  who  sang  at  His 
birth  and  men  who  praised  Him,  when  He  was  about  to  return  to 
heaven,  unite  one  with  another  in  His  praises.”  Theophylact : 
“ It  is  shown  that  the  former  war,  in  which  we  opposed  God,  has 
vanished  away,  and  that  God  is  praised  by  the  angels  in  such  a 
Reconciliation.  The  same  fact,  also,  that  God  walks  in  our  land 
shows  that  He  is  in  unity  with  us.” 

Ver.  41. — And  when  He,  &c.  To  show  the  bowels  of  His  love  to  it. 
How  dear  to  Him  was  the  salvation  of  the  Jews,  for  to  this  had  He 
been  sent  by  the  Father  as  the  Messiah  and  Saviour.  He  wept 
therefore  among  all  the  joys  of  His  triumph,  and  amidst  the  happy 
declamations  of  those  who  congratulated  Him  and  shouted  Hosanna, 
that  He  might  temper  their  joy,  by  a mixture  as  it  were  of  gall 
He  wept  as  well  over  the  blindness,  obduracy,  and  ingratitude  of  the 
people  of  Jerusalem,  because  they  would  not  receive  Him  as  their 
Messiah  and  Saviour,  as  for  the  vengeance  of  God  towards  them 
and  the  destruction  of  their  nation  by  Titus ; and  because  He  saw 
His  own  labours  and  sufferings  for  them  frustrated  and  rendered  of 
no  effect  These  three  causes  wrung  tears  from  Christ,  from  the 
vehemence  of  His  grief  So  S.  Cyril,  Bede,  Theophylact  and 
others.  In  trope , Origen  says,  “ Christ  fulfilled  all  the  beatitudes  in 
His  own  Person.  He  said,  ‘Blessed  are  they  that  mourn/  and 
He  therefore  wept” 

Ver.  42. — If  thou  hadst  known.  “As.  I know,”  says  S.  Gregory 
(horn.  39),  Bede  and  others.  Because  I am  come  to  thee  as  thy 
Messiah,  for  thy  salvation,  to  save  thee,  and  bring  thee  everlasting 
blessing,  according  to  the  words  of  Zech.  ix.  If  thou  hadst  known 
what  is  for  thy  good,  salvation,  and  happiness,  namely,  penitence  and 
taith  in  Me,  which  I have  taught  thee  these  three  years  past,  thou

wouldst  weep,  as  I do,  for  thy  past  blindness  and  obstinacy.  Euthy- 
mills  supplies,  “ Thou  wouldst  in  no  wise  perish.”  Others  say,  “ Thou 
wouldst  bear  thyself  otherwise ; listen  to  Me,  and  believe  in  Me.” 
The  Syriac  has,  “ If  thou  hadst  known  the  things  that  are  for  thy 
peace  and  salvation  in  this  thy  day.”  The  Arabic : “ If  thou  hadst 
known,  even  thou,  and  in  this  thy  day,  how  much  peace  there  was 
for  thee  in  it”  Peace,  in  Hebrew,  means  prosperity,  safety,  happi- 
ness, every  good,  both  of  body  and  soul 

It  is  an  aposopiopesis,  showing  the  profound  passion  of  grief  and 
indignation  in  Christ,  for  He  upbraids  the  ungrateful  city  with  its 
unbelief,  obstinacy,  and  ingratitude.  This  feeling  in  Christ  was  so 
strong  that  it  choked  His  voice,  and  compelled  Him  to  be  silent,  as 
by  aposopiopesis.  “For  those  who  weep,”  says  Euthymius,  “break 
off  their  words  abruptly,  from  the  strength  of  their  feelings.”  There  is 
again  great  passion  “ pathos,”  in  the  words ; “ Even  thou,  O daughter 
of  Zion,  by  Me  so  beloved,  so  honoured,  so  enriched  : for  thee  have 
I come  from  heaven  to  earth,  for  thee  was  I bom  at  Bethlehem, 
for  thee  have  I lived  thirty-four  years  in  continued  labour,  suffering, 
poverty.  For  three  years  have  I taught  and  preached  in  thy  towns 
and  villages ; I have  healed  thy  lepers,  thy  sick,  thy  possessed ; I 
have  restored  thy  dead  to  life.  Thou,  therefore,  daughter  of  Jeru- 
salem, why  dost  thou  not  return  the  love  of  one  who  so  loves  thee, 
but  scomest  and  destroyest  Him  as  an  enemy?  It  will  come,  it  will 
come  shortly,  that  great  day  of  the  Lord,  in  which  thou  will  too  late 
confess  thy  unbelief  and  lament  thy  blindness.  This  is  thy  day,  in 
which  thou  vainly  exultest  in  thy  wealth,  thy  luxury,  thy  pomps. 
But  My  day  shall  come,  yea,  the  day  of  the  Lord,  in  which  He  will 
most  grievously  punish  thee,  and  utterly  root  thee  out,  and  in  which 
thou  shalt  pour  forth  the  inconsolable  and  never  ceasing  tears  of 
most  bitter  anguish.”  Similar  is  the  passion  of  Christ  to  the  traitor 
Judas.  Ps.  v.  13. 

In  trope%  S.  Gregory  in  his  39th  Homily  says,  “The  perverse  soul, 
which  delights  in  the  passing  day,  here  meets  its  day.  The  soul, 
that  is,  to  which  present  things  are  peace,  because,  while  it  takes 
pleasure  in  temporal  prosperity : while  it  is  elevated  by  honour

JERUSALEM^  DOOM.

while  it  is  dissolved  in  the  pleasures  of  sense,  while  it  is  terrified  by 
no  thoughts  of  a punishment  to  come,  it  has  peace  in  its  day, 
although  in  one  to  come  it  will  meet  with  heavy  condemnation. 
For  it  will  be  afflicted  when  the  righteous  rejoice,  and  all  that  was 
lately  for  its  peace  will  be  turned  into  the  bitterness  of  contention. 
For  it  will  begin  to  be  at  strife  with  itself,  and  to  question  itself,  as 
to  why  it  had  not  feared  the  condemnation  to  come,  and  had  shut 
the  eyes  of  its  soul  to  the  prospect  of  the  evils  to  come. 

But  now  they  are  hid  from  thine  eyes . Because  (de  Jndustria)  thou 
wouldst  not  know,  says  Titus.  And  Eusebius,  in  the  Catena , “Christ 
makes  known  His  coming  for  the  peace  of  the  world,  and  when  they 
would  not  receive  that  peace,  it  was  hidden  from  them.”  The 
Incarnation  of  Christ,  His  preaching,  His  passion,  His  resurrection, 
were  hidden  from  the  Jews.  Equally  so  their  own  perfidy,  blindness, 
ingratitude,  and  therefore  their  punishment  and  destruction  by  Titus. 
“ For,”  says  S.  Gregory,  “ if  we  saw  the  evils  that  are  impending,  we 
should  not  rejoice  in  present  prosperity.”  Again,  in  figure,  “The 
perverse  soul,  while  it  loses  itself  in  the  enjoyments  of  the  present 
life,  what  does  it  but  walk  with  closed  eyes  into  the  fire?”  Hence 
it  is  well  written,  In  the  day  of  good  things  be  not  unmindful  of  the 
evil.  And  S.  Paul,  “ Let  those  that  rejoice  be  as  those  that  rejoice 
not.”  For  if  there  is  any  joy  in  the  present  time,  it  should  be  so  felt, 
as  that  the  bitterness  of  the  future  judgment  should  never  be  absent 
from  the  thoughts,  for  while  the  reverent  mind  is  pierced  by  fear  of 
the  final  punishment,  in  proportion  to  its  present  rejoicing  will  the 
wrath  hereafter  be  tempered. 

Ver.  43. — For  the  days  shall  come.  The  Greek  reads,  “Thy  enemies 
shall  cast  up  a bank  about  thee  and  compass  thee  round.”  The 
Arabic,  “ The  days  shall  come  in  which  thine  enemies  shall  throw 
down  thy  standards,  and  shall  surround  thee.”  How  truly  Christ 
foretold  this  appears  from  Josephus,  who  in  Bk.  vi.  chap.  37,  of  his 
“Wars  of  the  Jews,”  says  that  Titus  and  the  Romans  erected  three 
mounds  round  Jerusalem,  and,  in  the  space  of  only  three  days,  sur- 
rounded the  whole  city  with  a wall  of  39  stadia,  so  that  there  should 
be  neither  exit  nor  passage  for  any  one.  Christ  alludes  to  Isaiah

xxix.  i,  2,  “Woe  to  Ariel,”  &c.  For  Jerusalem,  which  before  was 
strong  and  unconquered,  was,  as  it  were,  Ariel — that  is,  the  Lion  of 
God,  now  deserted  by  me,  and  given  over  to  destruction  by  the 
Romans,  and  to  become,  as  it  were,  the  ram  of  justice,  and  the 
sacrifice  of  divine  vengeance.  So  Eusebius,  S.  Cyril  and  Theodoret 
on  Isaiah  xxix.  i. 

And  keep  thee  in  on  every  side.  To  such  a pitch  of  famine,  and  to 
such  straits  shalt  thou  be  reduced  that  mothers  shall  devour  even 
their  own  children.  Josephus,  “Wars  of  the  Jews”  chap.  xiv.  and 
following. 

Ver.  44. — And  shall  lay  thee  even  with  the  ground,  and  thy  children 
within  thee;  and  they  shall  not  leave  in  thee  one  stone  upon  another . 
That  is,  shall  destroy  thee  utterly;  spoken  in  hyperbole,  for  the 
Romans  were  not  so  laborious  or  so  idle,  as  to  leave  no  stone  upon 
another.  S.  Greg.,  hom.  xxxix.  The  migration  from  the  city  is  testi- 
fied to,  for  it  is  now  built  on  the  spot  where  the  Lord  was  crucified 
outside  the  gate.  The  former  Jerusalem  is  utterly  destroyed;  for 
Mount  Calvary  is  now  in  the  middle  of  the  new  city. 

Because  thou  kneiuest  not  the  time  of  thy  visitation.  “ The  time  of 
this  visitation,”  says  Titus,  “ is  that  of  Christ’s  coming  down  from 
heaven.”  “In  figure  all  these  things,”  says  S.  Gregory  hom.  39, 
“ happen  to  the  soul  that  has  lived  as  a slave  to  the  flesh.  For  then 
the  devils  surround  it  on  all  sides,  tempt  it,  hedge  it  in,  and  carry  it 
off  to  hell.  Then  all  that  erection  of  stones,  that  is,  their  thoughts, 
is  overthrown,  because  they  did  not  know  the  time  of  their  visitation, 
when  God  by  His  preachers,  His  confessors,  His  masters,  and  His 
internal  inspirations,  warned  them  to  amend  their  lives  and  take 
thought  for  their  salvation.”  Greg.,  Dial.  Bk.  iv.  chaps.  30,  38,  46,  52, 
and  following,  gives  the  dreadful  example  of  Chrysaorius  Theodore, 
King  Theodoric,  and  others.

CHAPTER  XX. 

I  Christ  avoucheth  his  authority  by  a question  of  John's  baptism,  9 The  parable 

of  the  vineyard,  19  Of  giving  tribute  to  Casar,  27  He  convinceth  the 

Sadducees  that  denied  the  resurrection,  41  How  Christ  is  the  son  of  Dagid. 

45  He  war  net h his  disciples  to  beware  of  the  scribes, 

A ND  it  came  to  pass,  that  on  one  of  those  days,  as  he  taught  the  people  in  the 
temple,  and  preached  the  gospel,  the  chief  priests  and  the  scribes  came 
upon  him  with  the  elders, 

2 And  spake  unto  him,  saying,  Tell  us,  by  what  authority  doest  thou  these  things? 
or  who  is  he  that  gave  thee  this  authority  ? 

3 And  he  answered  and  said  unto  them,  I will  also  ask  you  one  thing ; and 
answer  me : 

4 The  baptism  of  John,  was  it  from  heaven,  or  of  men  ? 

5 And  they  reasoned  with  themselves,  saying,  If  we  shall  say,  From  heaven; 
he  will  say,  Why  then  believed  ye  him  not  ? 

6 But  and  if  we  say,  Of  men ; all  the  people  will  stone  us  : for  they  be  per- 
suaded that  John  was  a prophet. 

7 And  they  answered,  that  they  could  not  tell  whence  it  was. 

8 And  Jesus  said  unto  them,  Neither  tell  I you  by  what  authority  I do  these 
things. 

9 Then  began  he  to  speak  to  the  people  this  parable ; A certain  man  planted  a vine- 
yard, and  let  it  forth  to  husbandmen,  and  went  into  a far  country  for  a long  time. 

10  And  at  the  season  he  sent  a servant  to  the  husbandmen,  that  they  should 
give  him  of  the  fruit  of  the  vineyard  : but  the  husbandmen  beat  him,  and  sent  him 
away  empty. 

1 1 And  again  he  sent  another  servant : and  they  beat  him  also,  and  entreated 
him  shamefully,  and  sent  him  away  empty. 

12  And  again  he  sent  a third : and  they  wounded  him  also,  and  cast  him  out. 

13  Then  said  the  Lord  of  the  vineyard,  What  shall  I do?  I will  send  my  be- 
loved Son  : it  may  be  they  will  reverence  him  when  they  see  him. 

14  But  when  the  husbandmen  saw  him,  they  reasoned  among  themselves, 
saying,  This  is  the  heir : come,  let  us  kill  him,  that  the  inheritance  may  be  ours. 

15  So  they  cast  him  out  of  the  vineyard,  and  killed  him.  What  therefore  shall 
the  Lord  of  the  vineyard  do  unto  them  ? 

16  He  shall  come  and  destroy  these  husbandmen  and  shall  give  the  vineyard  to 
others.  And  when  they  heard  it,  they  said,  God  forbid. 

17  And  he  beheld  them,  and  said,  What  is  this  then  that  is  written.  The  stone 
which  the  builders  rejected,  the  same  is  become  the  head  of  the  corner  ?. 

18  Whosoever  shall  fall  upon  that  stone  shall  be  broken  ; but  on  whomsoever  it 
shall  fall,  it  will  grind  him  to  powder

19  IT  And  the  chief  priests  and  the  scribes  the  same  hour  sought  to  lay  hands 
on  him  ; and  they  feared  the  people : for  they  perceived  that  he  had  spoken  this 
parable  against  them. 

20  And  they  watched  him,  and  sent  forth  spies,  which  should  feign  themselves 
just  men,  that  they  might  take  hold  of  his  words,  that  so  they  might  deliver  him 
unto  the  power  and  authority  of  the  governor. 

21  And  they  asked  him,  saying,  Master,  we  know  that  thou  sayest  and 
teachest  rightly,  neither  acceptest  thou  the  person  of  any,  but  teachest  the  way 
of  God  truly : 

22  Is  it  lawful  for  us  to  give  tribute  unto  Caesar,  or  no? 

23  But  he  perceived  their  craftiness,  and  said  unto  them,  Why  tempt  ye  me  ? 

24  Show  me  a penny.  Whose  image  and  superscription  hath  it?  They 
answered  and  said,  Caesar's. 

25  And  he  said  unto  them,  Render  therefore  unto  Caesar  the  things  which  be 
Caesar's,  and  unto  God  the  things  which  be  God's. 

26  And  they  could  not  take  hold  of  his  words  before  the  people : and  they 
marvelled  at  his  answer,  and  held  their  peace. 

27  Y Then  came  to  him  certain  of  the  Sadducees ; which  deny  that  there  is  any 
resurrection ; and  they  asked  him, 

28  Saying,  Master,  Moses  wrote  unto  us,  If  any  man’s  brother  die,  having  a 
wife,  and  he  die  without  children,  that  his  brother  should  take  his  wife,  and  raise 
up  seed  unto  his  brother. 

29  There  were  therefore  seven  brethren:  and  the  first  took  a wife,  and  died 
without  children. 

30  And  the  second  took  her  to  wife,  and  he  died  childless. 

31  And  the  third  took  her : and  in  like  maimer  the  seven  also  ; and  they  left 
no  children,  and  died. 

32  Last  of  all  the  woman  died  also. 

* 33  Therefore  in  the  resurrection  whose  wife  of  them  is  she  ? for  seven  had  her 

to  wife. 

34  And  Jesus  answering  said  unto  them,  The  children  of  this  world  marry,  and 
are  given  in  marriage  : 

35  But  they  which  shall  be  accounted  worthy  to  obtain  that  world,  and  the 
resurrection  from  the  dead,  neither  marry,  nor  are  given  in  marriage : 

36  Neither  can  they  die  any  more  : for  they  are  equal  unto  the  angels ; and  are 
the  children  of  God,  being  the  children  of  the  resurrection. 

37  Now  that  the  dead  are  raised,  even  Moses  showed  at  the  bush,  when  he 
calleth  the  Lord  the  God  of  Abraham,  and  the  God  of  Isaac,  and  the  God  of  Jacob. 

38  For  he  is  not  a God  of  the  dead,  but  of  the  living ; for  all  live  unto  him. 

39  % Then  certain  of  the  scribes  answering  said,  Master,  thou  hast  well  said. 

40  And  after  that  they  durst  not  ask  him  any  question  at  all, 

41  And  he  said  unto  them,  How  say  they  that  Christ  is  David's  son  ? 

42  And  David  himself  saith  in  the  book  of  Psalms,  The  Lord  said  unto  my 
Lord,  Sit  thou  at  my  right  hand, 

43  Till  I make  thine  enemies  thy  footstool. 

44  David  therefore  calleth  him  Lord,  how  is  he  then  his  son  ? 

45  IT  Then  in  the  audience  of  all  the  people  he  said  unto  his  disciples, 

46  Beware  of  the  scribes,  which  desire  to  walk  in  long  robes,  aud  love  greet

ings  in  the  markets,  and  the  highest  seats  in  the  synagogues,  and  the  chief  rooms 
at  feasts ; 

47  Which  devour  widows*  houses,  and  for  a show  make  long  prayers  : the  same 
shall  receive  greater  damnation. 

Ver.  36. — They  are  equal  unto  the  angels.  So  the  Arabic,  Syriac, 
Egyptian,  Persian,  and  Ethiopic;  equal  in  celibacy,  immortality, 
glory.  As  therefore  the  angels  do  not  marry  nor  generate,  so 
neither  do  the  Blessed,  because,  being  immortal  per  se , and  glorious, 
they  will  remain  for  ever.  For  generation  is  desired  in  this  life, 
because  of  death ; as  a mortal  father  might,  as  it  were,  survive  and 
endure  in  the  son  whom  he  leaves  alive.  So  S.  Cyril:  “As  the 
angels  are  not  of  generation,  so  they  who  rise  again  will  have  no 
need  of  marriage.”  S.  Chrysostom  on  Matt.  xxii. : “ Wives  are 
married  that  the  diminution,  which  is  by  death,  may  be  supplied 
by  birth.  But  death  will  not  be  there,  and,  in  consequence,  neither 
marriages,  nor  wives,  nor  generation.” 

And  are,  See.  “ They  are  called  the  children  of  God,”  says  Theo- 
phylact,  “as  being  bom  again  through  the  Resurrection,  not  only 
through  grace,  but  also  through  glory,  that  they  may  thus  resemble 
God  most  closely,  as  is  taught  by  S.  John,  1 Ep.  iil  2.  Then  as 
sons  they  shall  enter  into  the  inheritance  of  God  the  Father.” 

“They  are  called  the  sons  of  the  Resurrection,”  says  Theophylact, 
“because  they  appear  to  be  as  it  were  bom  to  a new,  happy,  and 
divine  life.” 

2.  They  will  be  the  sons  of  the  Resurrection,  that  is,  worthy  of 
the  Resurrection,  for  the  word  “son”  when  it  is  added  in  Hebrew 
to  the  genitive  of  reward  or  punishment,  means  one  subject  to,  one 
who  deserves,  or  who  is  destined  to,  such  a punishment  or  reward. 
Thus  men  are  called  the  sons  of  Death  and  Gehenna,  that  is,  men 
subject  to  death  and  hell;  and  the  sons  of  the  kingdom  and  the 
Resurrection,  that  is,  they  who  are  worthy  of  the  kingdom  of 
heaven,  and  of  the  Resurrection  of  the  blessed 
Ver.  40. — And  after  that  they  durst  not  ask  Him  any  question  at

which  was  the  greatest  commandment,  as  we  find  from  Matt  xxii.  35*

CHAPTER  XXI. 

I  Christ  commendeth  the  poor  widow.  5 He  foretelleth  the  destruction  of  the 
temple , and  of  the  city  Jerusalem  : 25  the  signs  also  which  shall  be  before  the 
last  day.  34  He  exhorteth  them  to  be  watchful. 

AND  he  looked  up  and  saw  the  rich  men  casting  their  gifts  into  the  treasury. 

2  And  he  saw  also  a certain  poor  widow  casting  in  thither  two  mites. 

3  And  he  said,  Of  a truth  I say  unto  you,  that  this  poor  widow  hath  cast  in 
more  than  they  all : 

4  For  all  these  have  of  their  abundance  cast  in  unto  the  offerings  of  God  : but 
she  of  her  penury  hath  cast  in  all  the  living  that  she  had. 

5  Y And  as  some  spake  of  the  temple,  how  it  was  adorned  with  goodly  stones 
and  gifts,  he  said, 

6  As  for  these  things  which  ye  behold,  the  days  will  come,  in  the  which  there 
shall  not  be  left  one  stone  upon  another,  that  shall  not  be  thrown  down. 

7  And  they  asked  him,  saying,  Master,  but  when  shall  these  things  be  ? and 
what  sign  will  there  be  when  these  things  shall  come  to  pass  ? 

8  And  he  said.  Take  heed  that  ye  be  not  deceived  : for  many  shall  come  in  my 
name,  saying,  I am  Christ ; and  the  time  draweth  near  : go  ye  not  therefore  after 
them. 

9  But  when  ye  shall  hear  of  wars  and  commotions,  be  not  terrified : for  these 
things  must  first  come  to  pass ; but  the  end  is  not  by  and  by. 

10  Then  said  he  unto  them,  Nation  shall  rise  against  nation,  and  kingdom 
against  kingdom  : 

11  And  great  earthquakes  shall  be  in  divers  places,  and  famines,  and  pesti- 
lences ; and  fearful  sights  and  great  signs  shall  there  be  from  heaven. 

12  But  before  all  these,  they  shall  lay  their  hands  on  you,  and  persecute  jw, 
delivering  you  up  to  the  synagogues,  and  into  prisons,  being  brought  before  kings 
and  rulers  for  my  name’s  sake. 

13  And  it  shall  turn  to  you  for  a testimony. 

14  Settle  it  therefore  in  your  hearts,  not  to  meditate  before  what  ye  shall 
answer : 

15  For  I will  give  you  a mouth  and  wisdom,  which  all  your  adversaries  shall 
not  be  able  to  gainsay  nor  resist. 

16  And  ye  shall  be  betrayed  both  by  parents,  and  brethren,  and  kinsfolks,  and 
friends ; and  some  of  you  shall  they  cause  to  be  put  to  death. 

17  And  ye  shall  be  hated  of  all  men  for  my  name’s  sake. 

18  But  there  shall  not  an  hair  of  your  head  perish. 

19  In  your  patience  possess  ye  your  souls.

THE  HOLY”  GOSPEL  OF  S.  LUKE.  47 1 

20  And  when  ye  shall  see  Jerusalem  compassed  with  armies,  then  know  that  the 
desolation  thereof  is  nigh. 

21  Then  let  them  which  are  in  Judaea  flee  to  the  mountains ; and  let  them 
which  are  in  the  midst  of  it  depart  out ; and  let  not  them  that  are  in  the  countries 
enter  thereinto. 

22  For  these  be  the  days  of  vengeance,  that  all  things  which  are  written  may 
be  fulfilled. 

23  But  woe  unto  them  that  are  with  child,  and  to  them  that  give  suck,  in 
those  days!  for  there  shall  be  great  distress  in  the  land,  and  wrath  upon  this 
people. 

24  And  they  shall  fall  by  the  edge  of  the  sword,  and  shall  be  led  away  captive 
into  all  nations : and  Jerusalem  shall  be  trodden  down  of  the  Gentiles,  until  the 
times  of  the  Gentiles  be  fulfilled. 

25  T And  there  shall  be  signs  in  the  sun,  and  in  the  moon,  and  in  the  stars ; 
and  upon  the  earth  distress  of  nations,  with  perplexity ; the  sea  and  the  waves 
roaring ; 

26  Men’s  hearts  failing  them  for  fear,  and  for  looking  after  those  things  which 
are  coming  on  the  earth : for  the  powers  of  heaven  shall  be  shaken. 

27  And  then  shall  they  see  the  Son  of  man  coming  in  a cloud  with  power  and 
great  glory. 

28  And  when  these  things  begin  to  come  to  pass,  then  look  up,  and  lift  up  your 
heads  ; for  your  redemption  draweth  nigh. 

29  And  he  spake  to  them  a parable  ; Behold  the  fig  tree,  and  all  the  trees  ; 

30  When  they  now  shoot  forth,  ye  see  and  know  of  your  own  selves  that 
summer  is  now  nigh  at  hand. 

31  So  likewise  ye,  when  ye  see  these  things  come  to  pass,  know  ye  that  the 
kingdom  of  God  is  nigh  at  hand. 

32  Verily  I say  unto  you,  This  generation  shall  not  pass  away,  till  all  be  ful- 
filled. 

33  Heaven  and  earth  shall  pass  away  ; but  my  words  shall  not  pass  away. 

34  IT  And  take  heed  to  yourselves,  lest  at  any  time  your  hearts  be  overcharged 
with  surfeiting,  and  drunkenness,  and  cares  of  this  life,  and  so  that  day  come  upon 
you  unawares. 

35  For  as  a snare  shall  it  come  on  all  them  that  dwell  on  the  face  of  the  whole 
earth. 

36  Watch  ye  therefore,  and  pray  always,  that  ye  may  be  accounted  worthy  to 
escape  all  these  things  that  shall  come  to  pass,  and  to  stand  before  the  Son  of 
man. 

37  And  in  the  day  time  he  was  teaching  in  the  temple  ; and  at  night  he  went 
out,  and  abode  in  the  mount  that  is  called  the  mount  of  Olives. 

38  And  all  the  people  came  early  in  the  morning  to  him  in  the  temple,  for  to 
hear  him. 


Ver.  18. — But  there  shall  not  an  hair  of  your  head  perish.  “Because,” 
says  S.  Gregory,  “ what  was  said  about  death  was  hard,  comfort  is 
added  at  once,  from  the  joy  of  the  resurrection,  when  it  is  said,  ‘a  hair 
of  your  head  shall  not  perish.9  For  we  know  that  the  flesh  when

wounded,  causes  pain,  but  the  hair  when  cut  does  not.  Our  Lord 
therefore  said  to  His  martyrs,  * A hair  of  your  head  shall  not  perish.1 ” 
From  these  words  of  Christ,  we  may  conclude  that  we  shall  rise  again 
with  our  actual  bodies.  S.  Augustine  (Be  Civitate , chap . 19, 20.)  So  S. 
Bonaventure,  S.  Thomas,  the  master  of  the  sentences,  Soto,  and  others. 
Their  proof  is  from  Matt.  x.  30  : “ The  very  hairs  of  your  head  are 
all  numbered ; ” and  from  this  of  S.  Luke,  “ Not  a hair  of  your  head 
shall  perish.”  “Not  in  length,”  says  S.  Augustine,  “but  in  number.” 

2.  We  may  collect  this  from  reason,  for  our  bodies  will  rise  with- 
out deformity,  with  their  natural  adornments  and  comeliness ; the 
adornment  of  the  head  is  the  hair,  the  beard,  the  nails.  If  any  one 
has  not  these  he  is  a deformed. 

Ver.  19. — In  your  patience  possess  ye  your  souls.  Patience,  therefore* 
is  the  possession  of  our  souls.  Firstly,  because  patience  rules  the 
soul  and  directs  it  in  peace,  and  bends  and  influences  it  as  it  pleases. 
Secondly,  because  no  one  can  keep  the  hope  of  a future  life,  as  S. 
Augustine  says,  unless  he  have  patience  in  the  labours  of  the  present 
one.  Thirdly,  S.  Gregory  ( Homily  xxxv.  in  Evangel.) : “ The  posses- 
sion of  the  soul  consists  of  the  virtue  of  patience,  because  patience  is 
the  root  and  guardian  of  all  virtues.  Through  patience,  we  possess 
our  souls,  because,  while  we  learn  to  govern  ourselves,  we  begin  to 
possess  the  knowledge  that  we  are  (quod  sumus,  quod  adverb).  It 
is  patience  to  endure  calmly  the  evils  we  suffer  from  others,  and  to 
be  affected  with  no  painful  feeling  against  him  who  inflicts  them 
upon  us.  For  whoever  so  takes  the  oppressions  of  others,  as  to 
grieve  in  silence,  but  to  look  out  for  a time  of  retribution,  does  not 
possess  this  virtue,  but  only  makes  a show  of  it  Again,  Solomon 
says,  Prov.  *vi.  32  : ‘The  patient  man  is  better  than  the  valiant,  and 
he  that  ruleth  his  spirit  than  he  that  taketh  cities.’  The  taking  of 
a city  is  therefore  a less  victory,  because  the  conquest  is  outside 
ourselves.  That  which  is  subdued  by  patience  is  greater,  because 
the  mind  is  subdued  by  itself,  and  subjects  itself  to  itself  when 
patience  subdues  it  to  the  humility  of  endurance.”  S.  Gregory  adds 
the  example  of  the  Abbot  Stephen,  who  returned  contumelies  with 
thanks,  and  thought  a gain,  loss,  and  considered  his  adversaries  his

helpers.  Hence,  at  his  death,  angels  were  seen  taking  his  soul  to 
heaven. 

The  impatient  do  not  possess  their  souls,  but  are  possessed  by 
the  vices  of  wrath  and  vindictiveness,  and  consequently  by  Satan. 
They,  only,  who  have  ardent  love  can  gain  true  patience,  as  those 
fervent  martyrs — SS.  Ignatius,  Laurence,  Sebastian,  Vincent,  and 
others.  Trajan  the  Emperor,  consequently,  said  when  he  conferred, 
by  his  sentence,  martyrdom  on  S.  Ignatius,  “ No  people  suffer  so 
much  for  their  God  as  the  Christians.”  S.  Gregory  (book  v.  Moral \ 
chap . 13),  “ What  is  it  to  possess  our  souls,  but  to  live  perfectly  in 
all  things,  and  to  govern  all  the  emotions  of  our  minds  by  the  art 
of  virtue?  Whoever  therefore  possesses  patience,  possesses  his 
soul,  because  he  is  thus  made  strong  against  all  adversities,  so  that 
he  rules  even  by  subduing  himself.  By  whatever  he  masters  him- 
self, he  clearly  shows  himself  unmastered,  for  when  he  masters 
himself  in  his  pleasures,  he  prepares  himself  to  be  unmastered  by 
their  opposites.”  In  his  39th  Epistle  to  Theoclister;  “In  your 
patience  possess  your  souls.  Consider  a moment  where  patience 
would  be  if  there  were  nothing  to  be  endured.  I suspect  that  he 
would  not  be  an  Abel  who  had  no  Cain.  For  if  the  good  were 
without  misfortunes,  they  could  not  be  perfectly  good,  for  they 
would  have  no  purgation.  Their  very  society  with  evil  is  the  puri- 
fication of  the  good.”  Hence,  says  Theodore  Studita  in  his  19th 
Catechetical  Lecture,  “ Endurance  is  the  highest  perfection  of 
virtue;”  and  Lucan  (lib.  ix.): 

Serpens,  sitis,  ardor,  arense  The  sandy  desert’s  burning  heat ; the 

Dalda  Virtutis,  gaudet  Patientia  duris.  pangs 

Of  raging  thirst ; its  serpent’s  cruel  fangs, 
Are  Virtue’s  sweets ; for  Patience  joys  in 
these, 

And  welcomes  hardships  more  than 
softest  ease. 

Lastly,  the  whole  band  of  virtues  flows  into  patience,  so  that  it 
appears  to  be  the  complex  of  all  virtues.  Seneca  (Ep.  69.  and 
following) : “ There  is  a fortitude  of  which  the  brands  are  patience.

endurance,  and  toleration.  There  is  prudence,  without  which  no 
undertaking  is  entered  upon,  and  which  persuades  us  to  endure 
bravely  what  we  cannot  escape.  There  is  constancy  which  cannot 
be  cast  down  from  its  pedestal,  and  the  determination  of  which  no 
force  can  overthrow.  Here  is  that  indivisible  society  of  virtues.* 
And  see  the  words  of  S.  James,  i.  4. 

Ver.  34. — And  take  heed  to  yourselves , lest  “ the  cares  of  this  life 
absorb  the  mind  and  sink  the  faculties,1’  says  Euthymius,  “ and  do 
not  allow  men  to  think  about  their  salvation.”  “The  cares  of  this 
life,”  says  Titus,  “debauchery  and  ebriety,  deprive  men  of  their 
senses,  obscure  their  faith,  and  cause  forgetfulness  of  all  that  is  use- 
ful and  necessary.  They  distract  the  mind,  seize  hold  of  it,  and 
absorb  it  in  the  cares  of  this  world.” 

Ver.  35. — For  as  a snare  shall  it  come  on  all  them  that  dwell  on 
the  face  of  the  whole  earth.  As  careless  birds  are  taken  craftily  by 
snares,  so  in  the  day  of  judgment  shall  the  men  of  pleasure  be. 
2 “ As  the  snare  strangles  the  birds,  so  shall  the  day  of  judgment 
choke  sinners.”  3.  “As  the  snare  always  keeps  hold,”  says  the 
Interlinear,  “ of  that  which  it  has  once  caught,  so  shall  the  sentence, 
given  by  one  Christian  Judge,  be  perpetual;  and  either  for  ever 
glorify  him  who  is  judged,  in  heaven,  or  consume  him  with  fire  in 
hell.” 

Ver.  36. — Watch  ye  therefore , and  pray  always , that  ye  may  be 
accounted  worthy  to  escape  all  these  things  that  shall  come  to  pass , and 
to  stand  before  the  Son  of  man.  The  Arabic  has,  “ That  you  may  be 
strengthened  in  flight.” 

Stand  before  the  Son  of  Man.  So  Wisdom  v.  1 : “ They  shall 

stand  with  great  constancy.”  “ To  those  therefore  who  give  them- 
selves up  to  vigils,  prayers,  and  good  works,  that  day  shall  not  be 
a snare,  but  a festival,”  says  Theophylact 

Ver.  37. — And  in  the  daytime  He  was  teaching  in  the  temple  ; and 
at  night  He  went  out , and  abode  in  the  mount  that  is  called  the  mount 
of  Olives.  Because  olives  abounded  in  it  Christ  gave  the  day  to 
preaching  and  to  His  neighbour,  but  the  night  to  prayer,  to  Himself, 
and  to  God.  Thus  He  gave  very  little  time  to  repose  and  slumber.

CHRIST’S  UNWEARIED  EMPLOYMENTS.

The  same  did  S.  Paul,  Dominic,  F.  Xavier,  and  others  like  them. 
“ He  went  by  night,”  says  Theophylact,  “ into  the  mountain,  to  show 
us  that  we  ought  to  hold  communion  with  God  in  quiet  at  night 
By  day  we  should  be  gentle,  and  do  good.”  So  Bede : “ What  He 
commanded  in  words,  He  confirmed  by  His  own  example ; for  when 
the  time  of  His  Passion  drew  near,  He  was  instant  in  teaching,  in 
watching,  and  in  prayers,  either  urging  those,  for  whom  He  was  to 
suffer,  to  faith  by  His  words,  or  commending  them  to  His  Father 
by  His  prayers.” 

Ver.  38. — And  all  the  people  came  early  in  the  morning  to  Him . 
The  senses  are  in  their  vigour  in  the  morning,  and  the  morning 
therefore,  as  the  best  part  of  the  day,  is  to  be  given  to  God.

CHAPTER  XXII. 

I  The  Jews  conspire  against  Christ.  3 Satan  prepareth  Judas  to  betray  him.  J 
The  apostles  prepare  the  passover.  19  Christ  instituteth  his  holy  supper,  21 
covertly  foretelleth  of  the  traitor,  24  dehorteth  the  rest  of  his  apostles  from  ambi- 
tion, 31  assureth  Peter  his  faith  should  not  fail;  34  and  yet  he  should  deny  him 
thrice.  39  He  prayeth  in  the  mount,  and  sweateth  blood,  47  is  betrayed  with  a 
kiss : 50  he  healeth  Malthas'  ear,  54  he  is  thrice  denied  of  Peter,  63  shamefully 
abused,  66  and  confesseth  himself  to  be  the  Son  of  God. 

NOW  the  feast  of  unleavened  bread  drew  nigh,  which  is  called  the  Passover. 

2  And  the  chief  priests  and  scribes  sought  how  they  might  kill  him  ; for 
they  feared  the  people. 

3  Y Then  entered  Satan  into  Judas  surnamed  Iscariot,  being  of  the  number  of 
the  twelve. 

4  And  he  went  his  way,  and  communed  with  the  chief  priests  and  captains, 
how  he  might  betray  him  unto  them. 

5  And  they  were  glad,  and  covenanted  to  give  him  money. 

6  And  he  promised,  and  sought  opportunity  to  betray  him  unto  them  in  the 
absence  of  the  multitude. 

7  T Then  came  the  day  of  unleavened  bread,  when  the  passover  must  be  killed. 
8 And  he  sent  Peter  and  John,  saying.  Go  and  prepare  us  the  passover,  that 
we  may  eat. 

9  And  they  said  unto  him,  Where  wilt  thou  that  we  prepare  ? 

10  And  he  said  unto  them,  Behold,  when  ye  are  entered  into  the  city,  there 
shall  a man  meet  you,  bearing  a pitcher  of  water;  follow  him  into  the  house 
where  he  entereth  in. 

1 1  And  ye  shall  say  unto  the  good  man  of  the  house,  The  Master  saith  unto 
thee,  Where  is  the  guestchamber,  where  I shall  eat  the  passover  with'  my  dis- 
ciples? 

12  And  he  shall  shew  you  a large  upper  room  furnished  : there  make  ready. 

13  And  they  went,  and  found  as  he  had  said  unto  them  : and  they  made  ready 
the  passover. 

14  And  when  the  hour  was  come,  he  sat  down,  and  the  twelve  apostles  with 
him. 

15  And  he  said  unto  them.  With  desire  I have  desired  to  eat  this  passover  with 
you  before  I suffer : 

16  For  I say  unto  you,  I will  not  any  more  eat  thereof,  until  it  be  fulfilled  in 
the  kingdom  of  God. 

17  And  he  took  the  cup,  and  gave  thanks,  and  said,  Take  this,  and  divide  U 
among  yourselves :

18  For  I say  unto  you,  I will  not  drink  of  the  fruit  of  the  vine,  until  the  king- 
dom of  God  shall  come. 

19  IT  And  he  took  bread,  and  gave  thanks,  and  brake  it , and  gave  unto  them, 
saying,  This  is  my  body  which  is  given  for  you  : this  do  in  remembrance  of  me. 

20  Likewise  also  the  cup  after  supper,  sayings  This  cup  is  the  new  testament 
in  my  blood,  which  is  shed  for  you. 

21  IT  But,  behold,  the  hand  of  him  that  betrayeth  me  is  with  me  on  the  table. 

22  And  truly  the  Son  of  man  goeth,  as  it  was  determined  : but  woe  unto  that 
man  by  whom  he  is  betrayed  ! 

23  And  they  began  to  enquire  among  themselves,  which  of  them  it  was  that 
should  do  this  thing. 

24  IT  And  there  was  also  a strife  among  them,  which  of  them  should  be  accounted 
the  greatest. 

25  And  he  said  unto  them,  The  kings  of  the  Gentiles  exercise  lordship  over 
them  ; and  they  that  exercise  authority  upon  them  are  called  benefactors. 

26  But  ye  shall  not  be  so  : but  he  that  is  greatest  among  you,  let  him  be  as  the 
younger  ; and  he  that  is  chief,  as  he  that  doth  serve. 

27  For  whether  is  greater,  he  that  sitteth  at  meat,  or  he  that  serveth  ? is  not  he 
that  sitteth  at  meat  ? but  I am  among  you  as  he  that  serveth. 

28  Ye  are  they  which  have  continued  with  me  in  my  temptations. 

29  And  I appoint  unto  you  a kingdom,  as  my  Father  hath  appointed  unto  me ; 

30  That  ye  may  eat  and  drink  at  my  table  in  my  kingdom,  and  sit  on  thrones 
judging  the  twelve  tribes  of  Israel. 

31  Y And  the  Lord  said,  Simon,  Simon,  behold,  Satan  hath  desired  to  have  you, 
that  he  may  siftjw  as  wheat : 

32  But  I have  prayed  for  thee,  that  thy  faith  fail  not : and  when  thou  art  con- 
verted, strengthen  thy  brethren. 

33  And  he  said  unto  him,  Lord,  I am  ready  to  go  with  thee,  both  into  prison, 
and  to  death. 

34  And  he  said,  I tell  thee,  Peter,  the  cock  shall  not  crow  this  day,  before  that 
thou  shalt  thrice  deny  that  thou  knowest  me. 

35  And  he  said  unto  them,  When  I sent  you  without  purse,  and  scrip,  and 
shoes,  lacked  ye  any  thing  ? And  they  said,  Nothing. 

36  Then  said  he  unto  them,  But  now,  he  that  hath  a purse,  let  him  take  it , and  like- 
wise his  scrip  : and  he  that  hath  no  sword,  let  him  sell  his  garment,  and  buy  one. 

37  For  I say  unto  you,  that  this  that  is  written  must  yet  be  accomplished  in 
me,  And  he  was  reckoned  among  the  transgressors  : for  the  things  concerning  me 
have  an  end. 

38  And  they  said,  Lord,  behold,  here  are  two  swords.  And  he  said  unto  them, 
It  is  enough. 

39  IT  And  he  came  out,  and  went,  as  he  was  wont,  to  the  mount  of  Olives  ; and 
his  disciples  also  followed  him. 

40  And  when  he  was  at  the  place,  he  said  unto  them,  Pray  that  ye  enter  not 
into  temptation. 

41  And  he  was  withdrawn  from  them  about  a stone's  cast,  and  kneeled  down 
and  prayed, 

42  Saying,  Father,  if  thou  be  willing,  remove  this  cup  from  me : nevertheless 
not  my  will,  but  thine,  be  done.

43  And  there  appeared  an  angel  unto  him  from  heaven,  strengthening  him. 

44  And  being  in  an  agony  he  prayed  more  earnestly  : and  his  sweat  was  as  it 
were  great  drops  of  blood  falling  down  to  the  ground.

46  And  said  unto  them,  Why  sleep  ye  ? rise  and  pray,  lest  ye  enter  into  temp- 
tation. 

47  Y And  while  he  yet  spake,  behold  a multitude,  and  he  that  was  called  Judas, 
one  of  the  twelve,  went  before  them,  and  drew  near  unto  Jesus  to  kiss  him. 

48  But  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Judas,  betrayest  thou  the  Son  of  man  with  a kiss  ? 

49  When  they  which  were  about  him  saw  what  would  follow,  they  said  unto 
him,  Lord,  shall  we  smite  with  the  sword  ? 

50  T And  one  of  them  smote  the  servant  of  the  high  priest,  and  cut  off  his  right 
ear. 

51  And  Jesus  answered  and  said,  Suffer  ye  thus  far.  And  he  touched  his  ear, 
and  healed  him. 

52  Then  Jesus  said  unto  the  chief  priests,  and  captains  of  the  temple,  and  the 
elders,  which  were  come  to  him,  Be  ye  come  out,  as  against  a thief,  with  swords 
and  staves? 

53  When  I was  daily  with  you  in  the  temple,  ye  stretched  forth  no  hands 
against  me  : but  this  is  your  hour,  and  the  power  of  darkness. 

54  T Then  took  they  him,  and  led  him,  and  brought  him  into  the  high  priest’s 
house.  And  Peter  followed  afar  off. 

55  And  when  they  had  kindled  a fire  in  the  midst  of  the  hall,  and  were  sat 
down  together,  Peter  sat  down  among  them. 

56  But  a certain  maid  beheld  him  as  he  sat  by  the  fire,  and  earnestly  looked 
upon  him,  and  said,  This  man  was  also  with  him. 

57  And  he  denied  him,  saying,  Woman,  I know  him  not 

58  And  after  a little  while  another  saw  him,  and  said,  Thou  art  also  of  them. 
And  Peter  said,  Man,  I am  not. 

59  And  about  the  space  of  one  hour  after  another  confidently  affirmed,  saying, 
Of  a truth  this  fellow  also  was  with  him  : for  he  is  a Galilaean. 

60  And  Peter  said,  Man,  I know  not  what  thou  sayest.  And  immediately, 
while  he  yet  spake,  the  cock  crew. 

61  And  the  Lord  turned,  and  looked  upon  Peter.  And  Peter  remembered  the 
word  of  the  Lord,  how  he  had  said  unto  him,  Before  the  cock  crow,  thou  shalt 
deny  me  thrice. 

62  And  Peter  went  out,  and  wept  bitterly. 

63  Y And  the  men  that  held  Jesus  mocked  him,  and  smote  him, 

64  And  when  they  had  blindfolded  him,  they  struck  him  on  the  face,  and 
asked  him,  saying,  Prophesy,  who  is  it  that  smote  thee? 

65  And  many  other  things  blasphemously  spake  they  against  him. 

66  T And  as  soon  as  it  was  day,  the  elders  of  the  people  and  the  chief  priests 
and  the  scribes  came  together,  and  led  him  into  their  council,  saying, 

67  Art  thou  the  Christ?  tell  us.  And  he  said  unto  them,  If  I tell  you,  ye  will 
not  believe : 

68  And  if  I also  ask  you,  ye  will  not  answer  me,  nor  let  me  go. 

69  Hereafter  shall  the  Son  of  man  sit  on  the  right  hand  of  the  power  of  God.

70  Then  said  they  all,  Art  thou  then  the  Son  of  God  ? And  he  said  unto  them, 
Ye  say  that  I am. 

71  And  they  said,  What  need  we  any  further  witness  ? for  we  ourselves  have 
heard  of  his  own  mouth. 

Ver.  6. — And  At  sought  opportunity  to  betray  Him  unto  them.  Judas 
sold  Jesus  Christ  on  the  fourth  day  of  the  week,  the  day  of  Mercury ; 
on  the  following  day,  or  the  day  of  Jupiter,  he  delivered  Him  to 
them.  Thence  followed  " the  day  of  unleavened  bread.”  See  how 
sudden  was  the  wickedness  of  the  Jews,  and  equally  cunning  and 
crafty.  For  they  knew  that  Christ  would  celebrate  the  Passover, 
according  to  His  custom,  on  the  day  following  at  Jerusalem,  and 
that  it  would  therefore  be  most  convenient  to  deliver  Him  up  then 
to  the  Jews  at  Jerusalem. 

Ver.  20. — This  cup  is  the  new  Testament  in  My  blood.  That  is, 
this  cup  is  the  authentic  instrument,  and,  as  it  were,  the  chart  and 
tabula  testamentaria,  in  which  My  new  covenant  is  written  and  signed 
for  giving  you  My  heavenly  inheritance,  written,  I say,  not  with  ink, 
but  in  My  blood.  1 Cor.  xi.  23,  &c. 

Ver.  25. — And  they  that  exercise  authority  upon  them  are  called  bene- 
factors. Benefactor  is  a title  of  honour  and  praise  which  is  bestowed 
upon  princes  because  they  are,  or  ought  to  be,  good.  The  proper 
epithet  of  kings  in  former  time  was  " good.”  Virgil  uses  it  of  Acestes 
\s£n  L 195).  Martial  applies  it  to  Trajan  and  Domitian,  and  Horace 
to  Romulus.  Homer  thought  nothing  requisite  in  a king,  but  to  be 
brave  against  the  enemy,  and  good  to  the  citizens.  Paul  calls  Felix 
“ Most  Excellent”  Acts  xxiv.  3. 

Ver.  26. — But  ye  shall  not  be  so.  The  Arabic  has  “ Let  the  greater 
of  you  be  as  the  least  ” — that  is,  let  him  among  you  who  wishes  to 
be  the  greatest,  become  the  least.  In  this  way  he  shall  be  the 
greatest. 

Morally , let  us  learn  this  parable  of  Christ,  incredible  to  the  world, 
but  in  itself  most  true,  and  by  experience  most  certain,  namely,  that 
the  way  to  exaltation  is  abasement  of  self.  Do  we  wish  to  become 
greater?  Let  us  become  less.  God  has  sanctioned  and  fixed  this 
way  by  His  eternal  law,  and  therefore  Christ  was  the  first-fruits  to

enter  upon  it,  that  we,  by  the  same  law,  might  follow  Him,  as  in 
Phil,  it  8,  9,  10,  11. 

Hence  S.  Francis,  a great  follower  and  imitator  of  Christ,  humbled 
himself  to  the  lowest  of  all  lowness,  and  wished  to  be  the  poorest 
and  vilest  of  all  men ; and  to  a certain  saint,  a most  lofty  and 
splendid  seat  in  heaven  was  shown,  and  when  he  asked  whose  it 
was,  the  answer  was  given,  M It  was  the  seat  of  one  of  the  great  ones 
among  the  fallen  angels,  but  it  is  now  reserved  for  the  holy  Francis.” 
S.  Bonav.,  chap,  vl,  Life  of  St  Francis.  The  same  S.  Francis 
wished  his  followers  to  be  called  “ Minores,”  lest  they  should  pre- 
sume to  become  majores.  His  scribe,  S.  Francis  de  Paula,  ordered 
the  brethren  of  his  order,  to  be  called  not  Minores  but  Minimi 
Hence  the  blessed  Magdelena  de  Pazzi,  who  has  been  lately 
enrolled  among  the  blessed  by  our  holy  Father,  Urban  VIII.,  received 
the  following  order  from  God,  “ Be  of  the  order  of  Minimse,  and  the 
least  of  them,  that  thou  mayest  strive  as  zealously  to  be  the  least  as 
men  of  this  world  do  to  be  the  greatest.”  S.  Elizabeth,  wife  of  the 
Landgrave  of  Hesse,  and  the  daughter  of  the  king  of  Hungary, 
personally,  against  the  remonstrances  of  her  friends,  tended  the  sick 
and  outcast,  and  said  that  if  there  were  any  position  more  humble 
still  she  would  gladly  fill  it,  the  more  closely  to  follow  Christ,  who  from 
the  first  humbled  Himself  to  be  the  lowest  of  men,  as  Isaiah  describes, 
ch.  liii  ; for  in  this  consists  the  crown  of  virtue  and  perfection.  The 
like  did  Hedwig,  Duchess  of  Polonia,  and  her  granddaughter,  S. 
Elizabeth,  Queen  of  Portugal.  So  S.  Paulinus,  Bishop  of  Nola,  sold 
himself  for  a slave,  for  the  good  of  a son  of  a widow,  that  he  might 
imitate  Christ,  and  make  himself  one  of  the  most  humble  of  men. 
Peter  Telonarius  did  the  same,  as  is  related  in  the  Life  of  S.  John 
Eleemosynarius.  This  is  what  the  wise  man  teaches,  Ecclus.  iii.  2a 
See  what  1 have  commented  thereon. 

Ver.  29. — And  I appoint  unto  you  a kingdom . As  My  Father  has 
decreed  and  prepared  for  Me,  through  humility  and  the  cross: 
through  so  many  labours  and  sufferings : a kingdom  heavenly  and 
eternal,  so  do  I also  appoint  the  same  unto  you : that  is,  I decree, 
prepare,  and,  going  to  death  I now  appoint,  as  by  my  will,  that

through  the  same  humility,  cross,  and  suffering,  you  shall  possess 
a like,  nay,  the  same  kingdom  with  Me  in  heaven ; dispute  not 
then  who  among  you  shall  be  greatest,  but  who  shall  be  less, 
that  each  may  study  to  surpass  the  other  in  low  estate  and 
humility,  for  whoever  does  this,  shall  be  first  and  greatest  in  my 
kingdom. 

Ver.  30. — That  ye  may  eat  and  drink  at  My  table  in  My  kingdom. 
As  kings  gave  to  their  most  intimate  nobles  a place  at  their  own 
table,  and  made  them  companions  of  their  banquets,  but  assigned  to 
other  and  less  famous  nobles  another  table,  so  will  I make  you,  My 
Apostles,  the  chief  and  foremost  of  My  kingdom,  and  place  you 
most  nearly  to  Myself,  and,  as  it  were,  at  My  table,  and  I will  have 
you  as  the  most  intimate  guests  of  My  royal  feasts.  “In  like 
manner,1 ” say  Euthymius,  Titus,  and  Theophylact,  “ He  shows  that 
the  Apostles,  as  the  first  and  most  illustrious  of  His  followers,  should 
enjoy  the  highest  honours  with  their  immortal  king.  It  is  by 
catachresis  that  the  pleasures  and  honours  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven 
are  often  compared  in  Holy  Scripture  to  banquets,  and  feasts  of  meat 
and  drink,  and  to  the  first  seats  at  table  with  kings ; because  carnal 
men  understand  these  things  best,  but  are  unable  to  estimate  spiritual 
ones,  and  because,  as  meat  and  drink  are  incorporated  into  ourselves 
and  made  our  own,  so,  in  heaven  by  the  beautiful  vision  and  His 
other  glorious  gifts,  God  will  be  incorporated  into  us,  as  it  were,  and 
will  be  made  our  own.” 

Ver.  31. — And  the  Lord  said,  Simon,  Simon , behold,  Satan  hath 
desired  to  have  you.  Sift — that  is  vex,  afflict,  agitate,  cast  you  down 
as  wheat  in  a sieve  that  it  may  be  cleared  of  chafT  and  dust  Satan 
in  the  same  manner  asked  God  to  permit  him  to  sift  and  afflict  Job, 
and  in  some  degree  he  obtained  his  end.  He  did  the  same  again 
to  Peter  and  the  other  Apostles,  and  again,  in  part  succeeded,  when 
he  stirred  up  the  Jews  to  seize  Christ,  for  then  the  Apostles  them- 
selves fled  in  fear  and  were  dispersed.  The  temptation  is  well 
compared  to  sifting  and  a sieve,  because,  as  by  means  of  the  sieve 
the  grains  of  wheat  are  separated  from  the  chaff,  and  remain  in  the 
sieve,  while  the  chaff  is  scattered  to  the  wind,  and  dispersed  in  air,

so  the  faithful  and  the  saints  in  temptation  remain  constant,  bat 
the  wicked  fail  and  fly  off. 

But  J have  prayed  for  thee , that  thy  faith  fail  not.  For  thee, 
because  I destine  thee  to  be  the  head  and  chief  of  the  Apostles  and 
of  My  Church,  that  thy  faith  fail  not  in  believing  Me  to  be  the 
Christ  and  the  Saviour  of  the  world.  Observe  that  Christ  in  this 
prayer  asked  and  obtained  for  Peter  two  especial  privileges  before 
the  other  Apostles  : the  first  was  personal,  that  he  should  never  fall 
from  faith  in  Christ ; for  Christ  looked  back  to  the  sifting  in  the 
former  verse,  that  is  the  temptation  of  His  own  apprehension  when 
the  other  Apostles  flew  off  from  Him  like  chaff  and  lost  their  faith, 
and  were  dispersed,  and  fled  into  all  parts.  But  Peter,  although  he 
denied  Christ  with  his  lips,  at  the  hour  foretold,  and  lost  his  love 
for  Him,  yet  retained  his  faith.  So  S.  Chrysostom  {Horn,  xxxviii.) 
on  S.  Matthew ; S.  Augustine  (de  corrept.  et  Grot.  chap.  viiL) ; 
Theophylact  and  others.  This  is  possible  but  not  certain,  for  F. 
Lucas  and  others  think  that  Peter  then  lost  both  his  faith  and  his 
love,  from  excessive  perturbation  and  fear;  but  only  for  a short 
time,  and  so  that  his  faith  afterwards  sprang  up  anew,  and  was 
restored  with  fresh  vitality.  Hence  it  is  thought  not  to  have  wholly 
failed,  or  to  have  been  tom  up  by  the  roots,  but  rather  to  have  been 
shaken  and  dead  for  a time. 

Another  and  a certain  privilege  was  common  to  Peter  with  all 
his  successors,  that  he  and  all  the  other  bishops  of  Rome  (for  Peter, 
as  Christ  willed,  founded  and  confirmed  the  Pontifical  Church  at 
Rome),  should  never  openly  fall  from  this  faith,  so  as  to  teach  the 
Church  heresy,  or  any  error,  contrary  to  the  faith.  So  S.  Leo  (serm. 
xxii.),  on  Natalis  of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul;  S.  Cyprian  (. Lib . L ep.  3), 
to  Cornelius;  Lucius  I.,  Felix  I.,  Agatho,  Nicolas  I.,  Leo  IX., 
Innocent  III.,  Bernard  and  others,  whom  Bellarmine  cites  and 
follows  (Lib.  i.  de  Pontif.  Roman). 

For  it  was  necessary  that  Christ,  by  His  most  wise  providence, 
should  provide  for  His  Church,  which  is  ever  being  sifted  and 
tempted  by  the  devil,  and  that  not  only  in  the  time  of  Peter,  but 
at  all  times  henceforth,  even  to  the  end  of  the  world,  an  oracle  of

the  true  faith  which  she  might  consult  in  every  doubt,  and  by  which 
she  might  be  taught  and  confirmed  in  the  faith,  otherwise  the  Church 
might  err  in  faith,  quod  absit  / For  she  is,  as  S.  Paul  said  to  Timothy, 
“the  pillar  and  ground  of  the  truth”  (1  Tim.  iii.  15).  This  oracle 
of  the  Church  then  is  Peter,  and  all  successive  bishops  of  Rome. 
This  promise  made  to  Peter  and  his  successors,  most  especially 
applies  to  the  time  when  Peter,  as  the  successor  of  Christ,  began  to 
be  the  head  of  the  Church,  that  is,  after  the  death  of  Christ. 

And  when  thou  art  converted , strengthen  thy  brethren,  “ From  the 
sifting  of  Satan,  that  is  from  his  temptation  and  from  the  sin  by 
which  thou  wilt  deny  Me ; for  by  this  thou  wilt  be  turned  aside  from 
Me,  and  My  grace  and  love.”  So  Euthymius,  Theophylact,  Jansen, 
F.  Lucas,  and  others. 

Some  take  this  converted  (conversus)  as  meaning  “again” 
(iterum).  So  Bede,  “ Do  thou,  O Peter,  again  confirm  the  Apostles 
thy  brethren,  in  the  faith  after  My  death,  whom  I now,  while  alive, 
strengthen  by  My  words.”  For  the  Hebrew  often  uses  the  verb  for 
the  adverb.  So  Ps.  lxxxv.  6. 

Strengthen  thy  brethren.  Thy  brethren,  and  therefore  Mine.  The 
condescension  of  Christ  here  is  wonderful.  He  does  not  call  the 
Apostles  sons  although  He  spiritually  begot  them  to  God,  but 
brothers  : as  well  because  Christ  as  man,  was  the  brother  of  all  men, 
being  a sharer  of  the  same  human  nature,  as  because  the  Apostles 
in  their  apostleship  and  preaching  of  the  Gospel,  were  the  brothers 
and  colleagues  of  Christ ; for  they  did  the  same  work  as  He. 
Hence  the  Fathers,  whom  I have  cited,  and  the  Doctors  of  the 
Church  conclude  that  Peter  was  set  over  the  other  Apostles  by 
Christ,  and  consequently  was  made  the  head  and  chief  over  the 
whole  Church,  that  he  might  build  up,  perfect,  and  confirm  the 
Church  in  the  faith  and  religion  of  Christ 

Ver.  36. — But  now  he  that  hath  a purse , let  him  take  it,  and  likewise 
his  scrip,  A purse  filled  with  money,  a scrip  with  food,  that  they  might 
have  support  in  the  impending  persecution ; for  they  will  never  find 
either,  “because  men  will  fly  from  Me,  who  am  bound  and  accused, 
and  consequently  from  My  disciples  as  men  wicked  and  condemned.”

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXII. 


And  he  that  hath  no  sword \ let  him  sell  his  garment , and  buy  one . 
Christ,  in  these  words,  did  not  command  them  to  take  a purse  and 
a scrip,  and  to  sell  their  garment  and  buy  a sword,  for  He  soon  after 
forbade  Peter  to  draw  his  sword ; but  they  were  a warning  of  the 
fierce  persecution  which  was  about  to  fall  upon  Himself  and  the 
apostles,  and  which  was  so  heavy  to  those  that  regarded  the  diffi- 
culty of  the  case  with  the  eyes  of  mere  human  wisdom,  that  food 
and  weapons  would  appear  things  absolutely  necessary  for  the  pre- 
servation of  life.  The  meaning  therefore  is  this,  “ Everything,  so 
far,  has  happened  to  you,  O my  Apostles,  well  and  prosperously ; for 
when  I sent  you  to  preach  the  Gospel  without  purse,  or  scrip,  or 
sword,  you  were  kindly  received  by  most,  fed,  and  sheltered,  and 
had  no  need  of  these  things.  But  now  so  grievous  a persecution  is 
impending  over  you,  and  so  great  is  the  danger  to  your  lives,  that 
in  human  prudence  it  may  seem  necessary  to  each  to  think  of  the 
preservation  of  his  life,  and  therefore  to  take  a scrip  and  purse  for 
provision,  and  a weapon  for  defence,  and  to  sell  his  cloak,  and  buy 
a sword.  But  to  Me,  who  weigh  circumstances  by  the  design  and 
decree  of  God  the  Father,  there  is  no  need  of  such  things ; for  I go 
voluntarily  to  the  cross,  and  to  death,  and  I offer  Myself  of  My  own 
free  will,  to  those  who  will  persecute  Me  and  crucify  Me,  so  that  I 
may  conform  Myself  to  the  will  of  My  Father.”  So  S.  Chrysostom 
{Horn,  85  on  S.  Matt.),  and  from  him  Theophylact  on  this  passage, 
Jansen,  Maldonatus,  and  others.  S.  Ambrose  says  well,  “ O Lord, 
why  commandest  Thou  me  to  buy  a sword,  and  forbiddest  me  to 
strike,  unless  that  I may  be  prepared  for  my  defence,  and  that  Thou 
mayest  appear  able  to  avenge  though  Thou  wouldst  not?” 

Ver.  38. — And  they  said9  Lord , behold^  here  are  two  swords . They 
did  not  understand  the  mind  and  words  of  Christ  clearly.  He  did 
not  mean  that  they  should  buy  swords,  but  He  wished  to  show  them 
the  impending  danger.  Christ  did  not  explain  His  meaning  to  the 
Apostles,  but  concealed  it,  saying,  “It  is  enough,”  meaning  that 
Peter  and  the  other  Apostles  might  carry  these  swords,  and  even  cut 
off  Malchus’  ear,  which  He  Himself  afterwards  restored  and  healed, 
showing  that  He  was  not  compelled  by  force,  but  was  urged  by  love,

willingly  and  freely  to  suffer  and  die.  Some  think  that  they  were 
not  military  swords,  but  rather  large  butchers’  knives,  which  the 
apostles  used  for  the  slaughtering,  sacrificing,  and  disjointing  of  the 
Paschal  Lamb.  So  S.  Chrysostom,  from  whom  I have  said  more 
on  Matt.  xxvii. 

Ver.  39. — And  He  came  out,  and  went , as  He  was  wont,  to  the 
mount  of  Olives . Bede  gives  the  reason  of  this : “ The  Lord,  when 
about  to  be  delivered  up,  came  to  the  retirement  of  this  accustomed 
place,  that  He  might  be  found  the  more  easily.  Where  are  they 
who  maintained  that  He  feared  death,  and  was  crucified  against 
His  will  ? Christ  was  wont,  in  these  last  days  of  His  life,  to  preach 
in  the  temple  by  day,  and  to  retire  at  night  to  the  mount  of  Olives 
to  pray.  This,  Judas,  as  being  an  Apostle,  and  a companion  of 
Christ,  knew ; and  hence  he  came  to  this  mountain  with  his  followers, 
and  there  betrayed  and  delivered  up  Christ  to  them.” 

Ver.  43. — And  there  appeared  an  angel  unto  Him  from  heaven. 
The  angel  appeared  in  a body  assumed  visibly  that  he  might  com- 
fort the  eyes  and  ears  of  Christ  by  his  appearance  and  voice. 
Jansenius  thinks  that  the  angel  appeared  at  each  of  Christ’s  three 
prayers,  and  therefore  comforted  Him  three  times,  to  teach  us  that 
God  always  hears  those  who  pray,  and  gives  them  grace  and  strength 
unceasingly.  F.  Lucas,  and  others,  think  with  more  reason,  that  the 
angel  only  appeared  once,  at  the  third  and  last  prayer,  and  comforted 
Him  when  He  prayed  more  earnestly,  and  sweated  blood,  to  show 
that  we  ought  to  persevere  in  prayer,  and  that  the  fruit  of  such  per- 
severance is  the  comfort  of  God,  and  the  vision  of  angels.  For 
after  this  consolation  from  the  Father  by  the  angel,  the  agony  of 
Christ  seems  to  have  passed  away,  and  He  appears  to  have  prayed 
no  more  but  to  have  prepared  bravely  for  death.  This  angel  was 
Gabriel,  says  Gabriel  Vasquez  (/.  p.  tom.  ii.  disput.  244,  No.  3),  for 
Gabriel  has  his  name  from  his  fortitude,  Gabriel  being  Geber-el  the 
man  of  God,  or  Gebura-el  the  fortitude  of  God ; for  he  has  the  office  of 
comforting  the  weak,  afflicted,  and  fearful.  But  he  comforted  Christ 
not  by  strengthening  His  weakness,  but  by  praising  His  surpassing 
fortitude.  Lud.  de  Pont  thinks  the  same  in  his  “ Meditation  on  the

Agony  of  Christ  in  the  Garden,”  because  Gabriel  was  the  legate  and 
messenger  of  the  (economy  of  Christ,  as  at  the  Incarnation  (Luke 
i.  26),  and  of  the  seventy  weeks  of  Daniel,  which  foretold  the  time 
of  the  nativity  of  Christ. 

Others,  however,  as  F.  Lucas,  think  that  it  was  Michael,  for  he 
is  the  highest  of  all  angels,  and  it  became  him,  as  such,  to  perform 
this  office  for  the  supreme  God,  that  is  Christ. 

Strengthening  Him . “ The  praise  and  due  adoration  of  Christ,” 

says  Titus,  u being  premised,”  he  comforted  Christ  by  speaking  to 
Him  outwardly  and  setting  before  Him  the  will  and  glory  of  the 
Father,  and  the  rich  fruit  which  would  ensue,  both  to  Christ  Him- 
self, to  men,  and  to  angels,  from  His  Passion.  For  the  angel  could 
not  affect  the  inner  mind  of  Christ,  nor  immediately  change  His 
inner  powers.  And  as  He  could  only  be  tempted  by  Satan,  ex- 
ternally, so  He  could  only  be  comforted  by  the  angel  outwardly. 
He  could  not  be  taught  nor  illuminated  by  him,  for  He  was  above 
all  angels,  and  from  the  first  moment  of  His  conception,  was  full  of 
wisdom  and  knowledge.  So  say  the  schoolmen  with  S.  Thomas  (3.  p. 
q.  12,  art.  4) : The  angel  spoke  the  following,  or  like  words  to  Christ, 
“ O Lord,  bravest  of  men,  Thy  prayer  is  most  acceptable  to  Thy 
Father ; because,  notwithstanding  Thy  natural  dread  of  death,  Thou 
resignedst  Thyself  wholly  to  the  will  of  the  Father  boldly  to  undergo 
the  death  appointed  for  Thee  by  Him.  Lay  aside  therefore  this 
Thy  horror  and  grief  with  which  Thou  hast  voluntarily  invested 
Thyself,  and  reassume  Thy  former  mind  and  strength,  and  come 
bravely  to  the  work  of  human  Redemption,  by  which  Thou  wilt 
most  signally  celebrate  the  glory  of  God,  rejoice  the  angels,  redeem 
men  from  Hell,  and  bring  them  back  to  the  glories  of  heaven. 
Endure  the  cross  for  the  joy  that  is  offered  Thee,  as  the  future 
author  and  perfector  of  the  faith  of  very  many.  Heb.  xii.  2.  Thus 
Thou  wilt  cause  SS.  Peter  and  Paul,  Laurentius,  Vincentius,  Agnes, 
Coecilia  and  very  many  other  martyrs  and  virgins,  men,  and  noble 
heroes  and  heroines  boldly  to  undergo  martyrdom  for  God,  and  the 
faithful,  with  other  holy  men,  who  triumphed  gloriously  over  the 
flesh,  the  world,  and  the  devil  I know  that  Thou,  O Lord,  hast  no

need  of  any  strengthening  of  mine,  who  am  myself  strengthened  by 
Thee  both  to  be  and  to  live;  but,  that  this  my  ministry  which  I 
execute  as  a steward  at  the  command  of  God  Thy  Father  may  be 
acceptable  to  Thee,  I pray  again  and  again.” 

Theophylact  thinks  that  the  angel  spoke  thus,  “ O Lord,  Thine 
is  the  strength,  for  thou  art  powerful  against  death  and  hell,  to  set 
free  the  race  of  men.” 

Ver.  44. — And  beingin  an  agony , He  prayed  more  earnestly . The 
“ et  ” here  in  the  Hebrew  is  causal,  and  means  quia,  because. 
That  is,  the  angel  comforted  Him;  because  being  in  an  agony 
and  praying  more  earnestly,  He  sweated  blood,  and  then  appeared 
to  need  comfort,  and  to  merit  it  The  following  was  the  order 
of  events.  Christ  had  prayed  the  first  and  second  time,  but 
felt  no  help  of  God.  Then  His  feeling  growing  on  Him, 
He,  permitting  the  agony  (that  is,  a more  vehement  horror  and 
anguish)  to  arise  in  Himself,  He  sweated  blood.  To  overcome 
this,  He  prayed  a third  time  more  earnestly,  teaching  us  that  as 
temptation  increases  our  prayers  should  increase  equally.  The 
angel  therefore  appeared  to  Him  immediately,  comforting  Him ; 
whereupon  He  ceased  to  pray  and  to  fear,  and  to  grieve,  and,  sup- 
pressing and  overcoming  His  agony,  He  manfully  prepared  Himself 
for  His  Passion,  and  went  forth  of  His  own  accord  to  meet 
Judas. 

More  earnestly . The  Greek  is  ixmirngor,  that  is,  more  ex- 
clusively, more  intensely.  For  this,  as  appears  from  SS.  Matthew 
and  Mark,  was  the  third  prayer  of  Christ,  and  He  appears  to  have 
remained  in  it  longer.  More  earnestly,  because,  as  the  anguish 
pressed  upon  Him,  Christ,  to  overcome  it,  at  once  directed  the  con- 
tention of  His  mind,  by  praying;  and  He  prayed  with  a more 
intense  feeling  and  ardour.  Luke  includes  in  one  as  in  a compen- 
dium, the  three  prayers  of  Matthew  and  Mark,  and  therefore  relates 
some  things  of  it,  which  took  place  in  the  first  and  second,  and 
some  which  took  place  in  the  third. 

And  His  sweat  was  as  it  were  great  drops  of  blood.  The  Greek  has 
0W*£o/,  gouts,  thick  masses.  The  Arabic  and  S.  Irenaeus  have

globl  The  Arabic  says,  “ His  sweat  was  (made)  as  distilling  blood 
descending  on  the  ground.” 

Note.  Firstly,  Some  copies  have  nothing  about  this  bloody 
sweat,  as  S.  Hilary  shows  (De  Trinit  lib . x.);  S.  Jerome  (lib.  ii. 
against  Pelagius),  lest  men  should  ascribe  infirmity  of  mind  and 
weakness  to  Christ  But  now  all  versions,  Greek,  Latin,  Syriac, 
Arabic,  have  the  same  account,  so  it  is  certainly  to  be  read,  accord- 
ing to  the  agreement  of  the  Council  of  Trent,  Session  IV. 

Secondly,  Christ  is  said  to  have  sweated  blood  not  improperly  or 
as  a by-word,  and  an  allegory,  as  we  say  of  one  who  is  grievously 
afflicted  and  tormented,  “he  sweats  blood,”  as  Euthymius  and 
Theophylact  explain  it— but  truly  and  properly.  Hence  the  words 
“ as  it  were  ” denote  not  resemblance  but  the  truth.  So  SS.  Hilary, 
Jerome,  Augustine  passim.  The  Ethiopic  renders  it  plainly,  “And 
His  sweat  was  made  as  the  sweat  of  blood  flowing  down  upon  the 
earth.”  The  Persian  agrees  with  it  S.  Athanasius,  also,  in  hi 
sixth  book  to  Theophilus,  which  is  on  the  Beatitude  of  the  Son  of 
God,  says,  “ Anathema  to  those  who  deny  that  Christ  sweated  true 
blood.” 

S.  Bernard,  treating  of  this  prayer  of  Christ  in  the  garden,  says, 
“Not  only  with  His  eyes  does  He  seem  to  have  wept,  but,  as  it 
were,  with  all  His  members,  that  His  whole  Body,  which  is  the 
Church,  might  be  the  more  effectually  purged  by  His  tears  ” ( Serm . 

3 on  Palm  Sunday).  The  love  of  Christ  indeed  was  not  content 
with  the  watery  tears  of  His  eyes,  but  wished,  by  the  bloody  tears 
of  His  whole  Body,  to  lament  and  blot  out  our  sins,  and  these  tears 
of  Christ  were  most  efficacious  with  God  the  Father.  “ For,”  says 
S.  Irenseus  (Lib.  v.  cap . i.)  “the  blood  of  Christ  has  a voice  and 

4 speaketh  better  things  than  that  of  Abel,1  Heb.  xii.  24.  The  blood 
of  Abel  calls  for  vengeance,  that  of  Christ  for  mercy.” 

Symbolically^  “the  reason  was,”  says  S.  Augustine,  “that  Christ 
might  show  that  from  His  whole  Body  would  proceed  the  passions 
of  martyrs  ” (Seutent.  sent  68).  Again,  “ The  blood  of  Christ,”  says 
Bede,  “ flowed  down  upon  the  earth  to  show  that  men  of  the  earth 
would  be  moistened  by  it.”

JESUS  BLOODY  SWEAT.

Ver.  45. — And  when  He  rose  up  from  prayer.  For  sorrow  contracts 
the  heart,  and  hinders  the  vital  and  subtle  spirits  from  being  sent 
to  the  head ; wherefore  the  black  and  crass  vapours  which  are  the 
cause  of  sleep,  invade  the  brain.  But  there  is  a hysteron  proteron 
here.  For  these  things  happened  before  the  bloody  sweat  which 
took  place  in  the  third  prayer  of  Christ,  while  the  former  happened 
in  the  first  prayer,  as  is  clear  from  SS.  Matthew  and  Mark.  The 
reason  is  that  S.  Luke  compresses  the  three  prayers  into  one,  and 
unites  what  happened  at  different  times  in  the  three  prayers  as  if 
they  had  been  done  in  one  and  the  same.  For  after  the  first  prayer, 
Christ,  visiting  the  Apostles  and  finding  them  asleep,  said  as  follows, 
Ver.  46. — And  said  unto  them,  Why  sleep  yet  See  what  has  been 
said  on  Matthew  xxvi.  xxvii.

CHAPTER  XXIII. 

I  Jesus  is  accused  before  Pilate , and  sent  to  Herod,  8 Herod  mocketh  Aim.  12 
Herod  and  Pilate  are  made  friends  13  Barabbas  is  desired  of  the  people , and 
is  loosed  by  Pilate , and  Jesus  is  given  to  be  crucified,  27  He  telleth  the 
women , that  lament  him , the  destruction  of  Jerusalem : 34  prayeth  for  his  enemies. 
39  Tivo  evildoers  are  crucified  with  him.  46  His  death.  50  His  burial. 

AND  the  whole  multitude  of  them  arose,  and  led  them  unto  Pilate. 

2  And  they  began  to  accuse  him,  saying,  We  found  this  fellow  perverting 
the  nation,  and  forbidding  to  give  tribute  to  Caesar,  saying  that  he  himself  is  Christ 
a King. 

3  And  Pilate  asked  him,  saying,  Art  thou  the  King  of  the  Jews?  And  he 
answered  him  and  said,  Thou  sayest  it. 

4  Then  said  Pilate  to  the  chief  priests  and  to  the  people,  I find  no  fault  in 
this  man. 

5  And  they  were  the  more  fierce,  saying,  He  stirreth  up  the  people,  teaching 
throughout  all  Jewry,  beginning  from  Galilee  to  this  place. 

6  When  Pilate  heard  of  Galilee,  he  asked  whether  the  man  were  a Galilsean. 

7  And  as  soon  as  he  knew  that  he  belonged  unto  Herod's  jurisdiction,  he  sent 
him  to  Herod,  who  himself  also  was  at  Jerusalem  at  that  time. 

8  Y And  when  Herod  saw  Jesus,  he  was  exceeding  glad  : for  he  was  desirous  to 
see  him  of  a long  season,  because  he  had  heard  many  things  of  him ; and  he  hoped 
to  have  seen  some  miracles  done  by  him. 

9  Then  he  questioned  with  him  in  many  words ; but  he  answered  him  nothing. 
10  And  the  chief  priests  and  scribes  stood  and  vehemently  accused  him. 

1 1  And  Herod  with  his  men  of  war  set  him  at  nought,  and  mocked  him,  and 
arrayed  him  in  a gorgeous  robe,  and  sent  him  again  to  Pilate. 

12  ^ And  the  same  day  Pilate  and  Herod  were  made  friends  together:  for 
before  they  were  at  enmity  between  themselves. 

13  ^ And  Pilate,  when  he  had  called  together  the  chief  priests  and  the  rulers 
and  the  people, 

14  Said  unto  them,  Ye  have  brought  this  man  unto  me,  as  one  that  perverteth 
the  people : and,  behold,  I,  having  examined  him  before  you,  have  found  no  fault 
in  this  man  touching  those  things  whereof  ye  accuse  him  : 

15  No,  nor  yet  Herod  : for  I sent  you  to  him ; and,  lo,  nothing  worthy  of  death 
is  done  unto  him. 

16  I will  therefore  chastise  him,  and  release  him. 

17  (For  of  necessity  he  must  release  one  unto  them  at  the  feast.) 

18  And  they  cried  out  all  at  once,  saying,  Away  with  this  man , and  release 
unto  us  Barabbas !

19  (Who  for  a certain  sedition  made  in  the  city,  and  for  murder,  was  cast  into 
prison.) 

20  Pilate  therefore,  willing  to  release  Jesus,  spake  again  to  them. 

21  But  they  cried,  sayings  Crucify  Aim,  crucify  him. 

22  And  he  said  unto  them  the  third  time,  Why,  what  evil  hath  he  done?  I 
have  found  no  cause  of  death  in  him  : I will  therefore  chastise  him,  and  let  Aim  go. 

23  And  they  were  instant  with  loud  voices,  requiring  that  he  might  be  crucified. 
And  the  voices  of  them  and  of  the  chief  priests  prevailed. 

24  And  Pilate  gave  sentence  that  it  should  be  as  they  required. 

25  And  he  released  unto  them  him  that  for  sedition  and  murder  was  cast  into 
prison,  whom  they  had  desired  ; but  he  delivered  Jesus  to  their  will. 

26  And  as  they  led  him  away,  they  laid  hold  upon  one  Simon  a Cyrenian 
coming  out  of  the  country,  and  on  him  they  laid  the  cross,  that  he  might  bear  it 
after  Jesus. 

27  IT  And  there  followed  him  a great  company  of  people,  and  of  women,  which 
also  bewailed  and  lamented  him. 

28  But  Jesus  turning  unto  them  said,  Daughters  of  Jerusalem,  weep  not  for 
me,  but  weep  for  yourselves,  and  for  your  children. 

29  For,  behold,  the  days  are  coming,  in  the  which  they  shall  say,  Blessed  ar$ 
the  barren,  and  the  wombs  that  never  bare,  and  the  paps  which  never  gave  suck. 

30  Then  shall  they  begin  to  say  to  the  mountains,  Fall  on  us  ; and  to  the  hills, 
Cover  us. 

31  For  if  they  do  these  things  in  a green  tree,  what  shall  be  done  in  the  dry  ? 

32  And  there  were  also  two  other,  malefactors,  led  with  him  to  -be  put  to 
death. 

• 33  And  when  they  were  come  to  the  place,  which  is  called  Calvary,  there 
they  crucified  him,  and  the  malefactors,  one  on  the  right  hand,  and  the  other  on 
the  left. 

34  IT  Then  said  Jesus, Father,  forgive  them;  for  they  know  not  what  they  da 
And  they  parted  his  raiment,  and  cast  lots. 

35  And  the  people  stood  beholding.  And  the  rulers  also  with  them  derided 
Aim,  saying,  He  saved  others ; let  him  save  himself,  if  he  be  Christ,  the  chosen 
of  God. 

36  And  the  soldiers  also  mocked  him,  coming  to  him,  and  offering  him  vinegar ; 

37  And  saying,  If  thou  be  the  king  of  the  Jews,  save  thyself. 

38  And  a superscription  also  was  written  over  him  in  letters  of  Greek,  and 
Latin,  and  Hebrew,  THIS  IS  THE  KING  OF  THE  JEWS. 

39  IT  And  one  of  the  malefactors  which  were  hanged  railed  on  him,  saying,  If 
thou  be  Christ,  save  thyself  and  us. 

40  But  the  other  answering  rebuked  him,  saying,  Dost  not  thou  fear  God, 
seeing  thou  art  in  the  same  condemnation  ? 

41  And  we  indeed  justly ; for  we  receive  the  due  reward  of  our  deeds : but 
this  man  hath  done  nothing  amiss. 

42  And  he  said  unto  Jesus,  Lord,  remember  me  when  thou  comest  into  thy 
kingdom. 

43  And  Jesus  said  unto  him,  Verily  I say  unto  thee,  To  day  shah  thou  b#  with 
me  in  paradise. 

44  And  it  was  about  the  sixth  hour,  and  there  was  a darkness  over  all  the  earth 
until  the  ninth  hour.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXIII. 


45  And  the  son  was  darkened,  and  the  veil  of  the  temple  was  rent  in  the  midst 

46  IT  And  when  Jesus  had  cried  with  a loud  voice,  he  said,  Father,  into  thy 
hands  I commend  my  spirit : and  having  said  thus,  he  gave  up  the  ghost 

47  Now  when  the  centurion  saw  what  was  done,  he  glorified  God,  saying. 
Certainly  this  was  a righteous  man. 

48  And  all  the  people  that  came  together  to  that  sight,  beholding  the  things 
which  were  done,  smote  their  breasts,  and  returned. 

49  And  all  his  acquaintance,  and  the  women  that  followed  him  from  Galilee, 
stood  afar  off,  beholding  these  things. 

50  S And,  behold,  there  was  a man  named  Joseph,  a counsellor ; and  he  was  a 
good  man,  and  a just : 

51  (The  same  had  not  consented  to  the  counsel  and  deed  of  them  ;)  he  was  of 
Arimathma,  a city  of  the  Jews : who  also  himself  waited  for  the  kingdom  of 
God. 

52  This  man  went  unto  Pilate,  and  begged  the  body  of  Jesus. 

53  And  he  took  it  down,  and  wrapped  it  in  linen,  and  laid  it  in  a sepulchre  that 
was  hewn  in  stone,  wherein  never  man  before  was  laid. 

54  And  that  day  was  the  preparation,  and  the  Sabbath  drew  on. 

55  And  the  women  also,  which  came  with  him  from  Galilee,  followed  after, 
and  beheld  the  sepulchre,  and  how  his  body  was  laid. 

56  And  they  returned,  and  prepared  spices  and  ointments;  and  rested  the 
sabbath  day  according  to  the  commandment. 


Ver.  39. — And  one  of  the  malefactors  which  were  hanged — (this 
one,  according  to  tradition,  hung  on  the  left  hand  of  Christ) — railed 
on  Him , sayings  If  thou  be  Christy  save  thyself  and  us. 

If  thou  be  the  Christ,  and  Saviour  of  the  world,  save  Thyself  and 
us,  free  us  from  the  cross  and  restore  us  to  life  and  liberty.  Christ 
chose  to  undergo  the  most  bitter  sufferings  from  all  classes,  and  to 
be  mocked  and  blasphemed,  not  only  by  the  scribes  and  Jews,  but 
even  by  the  robber,  the  companion  of  His  punishment  This  made 
His  trial  the  more  hard ; for  the  robber  ought  to  have  suffered  with 
Christ  and  to  have  taken  thought  for  the  salvation  of  his  soul,  and 
to  have  begged  it  of  Christ ; as  we  also  should  beg  that  we  may  be 
quiet  under  scoffs,  derisions,  and  insults,  and  be  patient  in  mind 
and  silent  in  speech. 

Ver.  40. — But  the  other  (who  is  said  to  have  hung  on  the  right 
side)  answering  rebuked  him.  The  Syriac  says,  “ Dost  thou  not  fear, 
no,  not  even  from  God  ” (etiam,  non,  a Deo,  non  times  tu)  ? — that  is, 
the  scribes  and  Jews  are  well  and  strong  and  do  not  fear  God,  and 
therefore  scoff  at  Christ;  but  thou,  who  art  tormented  on  the

cross,  oughtest  to  fear  Him,  lest  He  punish  thee  severely,  for 
blaspheming  His  Christ  so  sacrilegiously.  This  robber  showed  that 
he  not  only  feared  God  himself,  for  “the  beginning  of  wisdom ” 
(and  salvation)  “is  the  fear  of  the  Lord”  (Ecclus.  i.  16),  but  he  also 
exhorted  his  companion  to  the  same  fear.  That  is,  Let  the  Jews 
mock  at  Christ ; we  ought  to  fear  God,  because  we  are  in  the  same 
condemnation — the  punishment  of  the  cross,  to  which  we  are  justly 
condemned.  But  Christ,  who  was  innocent,  was  so  condemned 
unjustly.  Again,  we  should  rather  compassionate  a companion  in 
punishment,  especially  if  innocent,  than  reproach  him ; because  we 
ought  to  prepare  ourselves  for  death  and  the  judgment  of  God, 
where  we  shall  give  account  for  our  blasphemy  and  undergo  the 
heavy  punishment  of  Gehenna.  In  his  words,  “ Dost  thou  not  fear 
God?”  he  seems  to  allude  to  Christ  and  to  confess  Him  to  be  God. 
As  if  he  had  said,  “ Fear  thou  the  retribution  of  Christ,  whom  thou 
blasphemest,  for  He  is  not  only  man  but  God  also.”  For,  that  he 
believed  this  from  Christ’s  illumination  we  shall  shortly  see.  So  S. 
Ambrose,  and  Eusebius,  whose  words  I will  produce. 

. Ver.  41. — And  we  indeed  justly  ; for  we  receive  the  due  reward  of 
our  deeds.  This  was  an  act  of  profound  and  public  confession,  con- 
trition, and  repentance,  by  which  he  expiated  his  former  sins. 

But  this  man  hath  done  nothing  amiss . The  Greek  is  <2iwor,  which 
means  out  of  harmony,  unbecoming,  incongruous,  nothing  worthy  of 
the  slightest  blame  or  reprehension.  Lo  ! a free  and  public  confes- 
sion of,  and  testimony  to,  the  innocence  of  Christ,  given  before  the 
scribes  and  rulers,  who  had  condemned  Him,  fearing  nothing. 

Ver.  42. — And  he  said  unto  Jesus , Lord,  remember  me  when  thou 
contest  into  Thy  kingdom . “ The  heavenly  and  divine  kingdom,  to 

which  Thou  passest  through  the  death  of  the  cross,  that  shortly  Thou 
mayest  enter  into  it  by  death,  and  bring  into  it  Thine  elect.  Where- 
fore I beseech  Thee  to  bring  me  also  into  it  with  Thyself,  and  I 
implore  of  Thee  pardon  for  all  sinners,  for  whom  I very  greatly 
grieve.  I offer  to  Thee,  moreover,  the  torments  of  this  cross,  and 
the  death  upon  it  which  I willingly  undergo.  To  this  end,  I 
wholly  resign,  dedicate,  and  consecrate  myself  to  Thee;  I would

that  it  were  given  to  me  to  suffer  these  and  still  other  torments  for 
Thy  faith  and  love.”  These  words  show  his  living  and  ardent  faith, 
hope,  love,  humility,  patience,  contrition,  and  other  virtues. 

Moraliier . Learn  from  this  the  strength,  efficacy,  and  swiftness 
of  * the  grace  of  Christ,  by  which,  from  the  cross  itself,  He  made  a 
man  holy,  most  holy.  Wonderful  was  the  conversion  of  S.  M. 
Magdalene — wonderful  that  of  S.  Paul,  but  much  more  wonderful 
this  of  the  thief.  For  S.  Mary  had  witnessed  the  words  and  miracles 
of  Christ ; and  S.  Paul  had  felt  Him  strike  him  from  heaven ; but 
the  thief  on  the  very  cross,  where  Christ  was  suffering  the  infamous 
and  atrocious  death  of  a criminal,  was  converted  to  Him  by  herioc 
acts  of  faith,  love,  devotion,  &c. 

SS.  Jerome,  Chrysostom,  Theophylact,  Euthymius,  on  S.  Matt 
xxvii.,  Cyril  of  Jerusalem  in  his  Catechetical  Lectures,  xiii.,  Origen, 
Tract  xxxv.  on  S.  Matt,  say  that  this  thief  had  first  blasphemed 
Christ  with  his  companion,  for  SS.  Matt  and  Mark  say  in  the 
plural  " the  thieves  reproached  Him,”  though  SS.  Augustine, 
Epiphanius,  Anselm  and  others  think,  like  Suarez,  with  more  pro- 
bability, the  contrary.  These  think  that  one  of  them  was  called 
“ the  thieves  ” by  synecdoche,  for  S.  Luke  says  that  one  blasphemed 
and  the  other  confessed.  If  one  of  them  blasphemed  first,  so 
much  the  greater  miracle  that  conversion  by  which  he  suddenly 
changed  blasphemy  into  the  confession  and  praise  of  Christ 
This  change  of  the  thief  was  “ the  right  hand  of  the  High  One  ” 
(Ps.  cxviiL  15,  16;  dextera  Excdsi).  It  may  be  asked  by  what 
means  he  was  converted.  I reply,  1.  Outwardly,  by  the  example 
of  the  virtues  which  he  discerned  in  Christ,  namely,  His  singular 
love,  by  which  he  heard  Him  praying  for  His  enemies,  His  patience, 
fortitude,  religion,  and  all  virtues.  So  Theophylact  and  Euthy- 
mius, c.  67,  on  S.  Matt  2.  Inwardly,  by  the  rare  and  almost  mira 
culous  motion  and  representation  of  God,  by  which  he  knew  Christ 
to  be  innocent  and  the  King  of  a higher  kingdom  and  the  supreme 
Lord,  in  whose  power  it  was  to  make  even  a dead  man  happy ; and 
therefore  that  He  was  the  Messiah,  the  Son  of  God  and  the  Saviour 
of  the  world.  So  S.  Leo  (Serm.  ii.  de  Pass.) : “ What  exhortation

THE  PENITENT  THIEF’S  CONFESSION.  495 

persuaded  him  to  the  faith?  What  teaching  instilled  it?  What 
preacher  kindled  it?  He  had  not  seen  the  miracles  performed 
previously ; the  healing  of  the  sick  had  ceased  ; the  giving  of  sight 
to  the  blind,  the  recalling  of  the  dead  to  life,  the  things  that  were 
about  to  happen  had  not  taken  place  yet,  and  he  still  confesses 
Christ  to  be  the  Lord,  whom  he  saw  to  be  a partaker  of  his  own 
suffering.  Hence  came  this  gift,  hence  this  faith  received  its 
answer.”  Observe  the  above  words,  “the  things  that  were  about 
to  happen  had  not  taken  place  yet,”  for  they  seem  silently  to 
reprove  those  of  S.  Jerome,  on  chap,  xxvii.  S.  Matt.,  “ When  the  sun 
disappeared,  and  the  earth  was  moved,  and  the  rocks  were  rent,  and 
the  darkness  rushed  down,  one  thief  began  to  believe  and  to  confess 
Christ”  This  opinion  of  S.  Jerome  is  stated  by  S.  Chrysostom 
almost  in  the  same  words,  in  his  second  Homily  “ On  the  Cross  and 
the  Thief,”  and  by  Origen,  in  tract  34  on  S.  Matt. 

But  it  is  wonderful  that  these  Fathers  did  not  see  that  this  asser- 
tion was  at  variance  with  the  Gospel,  because,  except  the  darkness, 
the  other  signs  happened  after  the  death  of  Christ,  as  is  clear  from 
the  gospel  of  S.  Luke,  whilst  it  is  plain  from  the  same  gospel  that 
the  thief  was  converted  whilst  Christ  was  alive ; for  the  cessation  of 
the  sun’s  light,  and  the  darkness  are  related  by  S.  Luke  after  the 
conversion  of  the  thief  S.  Cyril  teaches  the  same  as  S.  Leo  ( Cat 
Led,  xiii.)  saying,  “What  virtue  illuminated  thee,  O thief?  Who 
taught  thee  to  love  contempt,  and  that,  when  thou  wast  affixed  to 
the  cross  ? O light  undying,  lighting  the  darkness ! ” S.  Augustine 
follows  out  at  length  the  same  idea  ( Serm . xiii.  de  Temp!)  \ S.  Chry- 
sostom (Horn,  de  Latrone , and  Serm . 1 de  Cruce  et  Latrone ).  Suarez 
also ; who  adds  that  it  was  possible  that  the  thief,  before  he  was 
imprisoned,  may  have  heard  Christ  preach,  or  have  seen  His  miracles, 
or  heard  of  them,  and,  perhaps,  have  believed  in  Him.  S.  Vincentius, 
in  his  Sermon  on  the  Good  Thief,  says,  that  he  was  converted  by  the 
shadow  of  Christ,  when  the  sun  in  its  decline,  and  the  shadow  of 
the  cross,  touched  him.  So  the  shadow  of  S.  Peter  healed  the  sick. 
Acts  iii.  Others  add  that  the  virgin  stood  in  the  midst,  between  the 
thief  and  Christ,  and  obtained  this  grace  for  him,  and  that  Christ

showed  Himself  to  him  when  he  was  dying,  as  truly  crucified,  as 
they  who  are  crucified  are  shown  to  the  people.  Add,  that  he  saw 
the  heavens  and  the  earth  darkened,  and  the  day  changed  into 
night,  because  of  the  Cross  and  death  of  its  Creator. 

The  extraordinary  holiness  of  this  thief  appears  from  his  great 
faith,  hope,  and  love.  Faith  by  which  he  believed  in  Christ  as  the 
king  of  kings,  though  he  saw  him  as  the  vilest  of  men,  nay  as  a cruci- 
fied thief.  Hope,  by  which  he  sought  from  Christ  to  be  admitted 
into  His  kingdom.  Love,  by  which  he  rebuked  the  blasphemy  of 
his  companion.  He  openly  confessed,  and  defended  the  innocence 
of  Christ  against  the  Jews  and  His  most  bitter  enemies,  when  all 
the  others,  even  the  Apostles  themselves,  fled  for  fear  and  deserted 
Him.  His  confession,  therefore,  was  heroic  S.  Greg,  (xviii.  Moral, 
chap.  13):  “On  the  cross,  the  nails  fastened  his  hands  and  feet, 

and  nothing  of  him  remained  free  from  punishment,  but  his  heart 
and  tongue.  God  inspired  him  to  offer  the  whole  to  Him,  of  that 
which  he  found  free  in  himself,  to  believe  with  his  heart  to  righteous- 
ness, and  to  confess  with  his  lips  to  salvation.  In  the  hearts  of  the 
faithful  there  are,  as  the  Apostle  testifies,  three  chief  virtues,  faith, 
hope,  and  charity,  all  of  which  the  thief,  filled  with  sudden  grace,  both 
received  and  preserved  on  the  cross.” 

S.  Augustine  ( Serm . de  Feria  3,  Of  the  Pasch ; and  Book  1 On 
the  Soul  and  its  Origin,  chap.  9) : “ To  this  faith  I know  not  what 
can  be  added.  If  they  trembled  who  saw  Christ  raise  the  dead,  he 
believed  who  saw  Him  hanging  with  himself  on  the  cross.  Assuredly 
Christ  found  not  so  great  faith  in  Israel,  nay,  in  the  whole  world. 

“ Before  he  asked  any  thing  for  himself,  he  laboured  to  benefit  his 
companion.  This  was  a mark  of  singular  charity.”  S.  Chrysostom, 
Some  in  fact  call  this  thief  a martyr,  like  S.  Cyprian  in  his  letter  to 
Fabian,  and  assert  him  to  have  been  baptized  in  His  own  blood. 
He  repeats  the  same  in  his  Serms.  de  Cana  and  de  Passione — where 
he  says,  M The  thief  by  his  confession  on  the  cross,  not  only  merited 
indulgence,  but  was  made  the  companion  of  Christ,  and  was  sent 
before  Him  to  Paradise,  and  made  a sharer  of  His  kingdom  by  con- 
fession, and  a partner  of  martyrdom.”  S.  Augustine  refers  to  these

THE  THIEF  A MARTYR. 


497 


words  of  S.  Cyprian,  Lib.  i.  On  the  Soul  and  its  Origin,  and  Lib.  iv. 
On  Baptism,  chap,  a a,  where  he  says,  “The  thief  had  no  need  of 
baptism  or  martyrdom,  but  was  saved  by  his  contrition  alone.”  He 
had  said  before  “ that  although  the  thief  did  not  die  for  Christ,  yet 
his  death  was  of  equal  avail  with  God  (because  he  confessed  the 
Lord  crucified)  as  if  he  had  been  crucified  for  Him,  and  so  the 
measure  of  martyrdom  was  found  in  him  who  believed  in  Christ 
when  they  who  were  to  be  martyrs  fell  away.” 

S.  Augustine  again  (serm.  120  De  Tempore)  : “The  thief  was  not 
yet  called,  but  was  already  an  elect — he  was  not  yet  of  the  household, 
but  he  was  a friend — not  a disciple,  but  a master — and,  from  a thief, 
a confessor ; for  although  punishment  had  commenced  in  the  thief 
it  was  perfected  in  the  martyr.”  De  anima  et  efus  orig.  cap . 9 : 
“The  robber  ranked  as  highly  for  his  confession  of  his  crucified 
Lord  as  if  he  had  been  martyred  for  Him.”  S.  Jerome  (Ep.  13 
to  Paulinus) : “ The  thief  changed  the  cross  for  paradise,  and  made 
the  punishment  of  his  murder,  martyrdom.”  Drogo,  Bishop  of  Ostia 
{Tract,  de  Sac.  Dom.  Pass.  tom.  it.  Bibliothica  SS.  Patrum ),  calls 
him  “ a martyr.”  Some  assert,  as  a probable  reason  of  his  martyrdom, 
that  the  Jews  hearing  his  confession  of  Christ,  by  which  he  con- 
demned their  deeds  and  their  judgment  on  Christ,  were  so  stirred 
up  by  anger  against  him  as  to  break  his  legs,  as  the  Gospel  relates, 
and  to  make  his  death  more  speedy  and  painful,  and  in  the  end  to 
make  him  a martyr.  And  S.  Hilary  {lib.  ii.  de  Trin.)  calls  him  a 
martyr.  “ He  promised  to  His  martyr  paradise — His  martyr,  that 
is,  His  witness,  because  the  thief  on  the  cross  bore  testimony  to  his 
own  faith  and  hope  in  Christ,  or  he  would  not  have  been  properly 
and  precisely  a martyr,  because  he  suffered  for  his  own  sins,  and 
not  for  Christ : unless,  as  I have  already  suggested,  we  say  that  the 
Jews  aggravated  and  accelerated  his  death,  because  of  his  confession.” 
Lastly,  the  Abbot  Amaldes  or  Renald  (Tract  29  on  the  Seven 
words  of  Christ  on  the  Cross,  in  the  Bibliotheca  SS.  Patrum),  asserts 
that  the  thief  was  carried  up  into  the  heavens,  and  possessed  a seat 
above  all  angels  and  above  all  cherubim  and  seraphim,  even  the 

throne  of  Lucifer  himself.  See  Stephen  Binettus'  Book  on  the  Good

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXIII. 


Thief,  where  he  calls  him  “ The  Archangel  of  Paradise,  the  first-born 
son  of  the  crucified  Christ,  the  martyr,  the  apostle  and  preacher  of  the 
whole  world,  who,  from  his  chair  of  the  cross,  preached  Christ  to 
the  whole  world.”  “ Paul,”  he  said,  “ preached  like  the  cherubim, 
the  thief  loved  as  the  seraphim.”  Hear  now  the  praises  of  the 
fathers  of  him. 

S.  Chrysostom  (Homily  on  the  Cross  and  the  Thief) : “The  thief 
purchased  salvation  from  the  tree.  This  thief  stole  the  heavenly 
empire,  he  used  compulsion  to  Majesty.”  And  below,  “We  find 
no  one  before  the  thief  to  have  merited  the  promise  of  paradise, 
not  Abraham,  not  Isaac,  not  Jacob,  not  Moses,  not  the  Prophets  or 
Apostles,  but  before  all  we  find  the  thief”  He  then  compares  the 
faith  of  the  thief  to  that  of  Abraham,  Isaac,  Ezekiel,  Moses,  and 
this  because  he  believed  in  Him,  not  in  the  temple,  nor  on  His 
throne,  nor  in  His  glory,  but  as  He  was  on  the  cross  and  in  tor- 
ments. “ He  sees  Him,”  he  says,  “ in  torments  and  adores  Him  as 
if  He  were  in  glory.  He  sees  Him  on  the  cross  and  prays  to  Him 
as  if  He  were  sitting  in  heaven.  He  sees  Him  and  he  calls  upon 
Him,  hailing  Him  as  King  of  kings,  saying,  ‘Lord,  remember  me 
when  Thou  comest  into  Thy  kingdom.’  Thou  seest  one  crucified 
and  thou  callest  Him  a King,  thou  seest  Him  hanging  on  a tree 
and  thou  thinkest  of  the  kingdoms  of  the  heavens.  O wonderful 
conversion  of  a thief  1 ” 

S.  Ambrose  (serm.  45) : “ It  is  the  more  to  his  grace  and  praise 
that  he  believed  in  Christ  on  the  cross ; and  the  suffering  which  was 
a scandal  to  others,  availed  to  him  for  faith.  Rightly  then  did  he 
purchase  paradise  who  thought  the  cross  of  Christ  not  an  offence 
but  a virtue.”  And  serm.  50 : “ Let  him  see  His  gaping  wounds, 
let  him  look  at  His  blood  gushing  out — he  still  believes  Him  to  be 
God  whom  he  knew  not  to  be  a criminal,  he  confesses  Him  to  be 
righteous  whom  he  knew  not  as  a sinner.”  And  shordy  after,  “ He 
understood  that  for  the  sins  of  others  Christ  bore  these  wounds. 
He  knew  that  those  wounds  on  the  body  of  Christ  were  not  the 
wounds  of  Christ,  but  of  the  thie£  and  he  therefore  began  to  love 
Him  more  when,  on  the  Body  of  Christ,  he  had  recognised  his  own

wounds.”  Again,  “ Great  and  wonderful,  indeed,  is  that  faith  which 
believed  that  Christ  crucified  was  glorified  rather  than  punished 
For  in  this  was  the  form  of  his  whole  salvation.  He  then  recognised 
the  Lord  of  Majesty,  when  he  saw  Him  crucified  with  the  patience 
of  humility.  He  went  before  in  devotion,  who  went  before  also 
in  reward.  For  the  thief  came  into  paradise  before  the  Apostles.” 

Eusebius  of  Emissa  (or  whoever  was  the  author,  for  the  style 
shows  that  he  was  a Latin,  not  a Greek  or  Syrian  like  Eusebius)  in 
his  Homily  “De  Latrone  beato:”  “How  singular  and  how  stu- 
pendous that  devotion.  The  criminal  believed  at  the  very  moment 
when  the  elect  denied.  It  was  more  praiseworthy  and  more  admirable 
in  the  thief  to  believe  in  the  Lord  when  in  bonds,  and  falling  under  the 
last  punishments,  than  if  he  had  done  so  when  He  was  doing  mighty 
works.  Not  therefore  without  reason  did  he  merit  such  a reward.” 
He  adds  the  cause.  “ The  heart  of  the  thief,  I think,  who  was  now 
a believer  in  Christ,  was  illuminated  more  properly  by  the  Godhead 
in  a bodily  form,  which  had  infused  Itself  more  widely  at  that  moment 
of  the  consummation  of  the  redemption.”  And  again,  “ He  did  not 
say,  * If  Thou  art  God  deliver  me  from  this  present  suffering,1  but  his 
‘ because  Thou  art  God  deliver  me  from  the  judgment  to  come,’ 
shows  to  the  world  its  Judge  and  the  King  of  ages.  Although 
punishment  began  in  the  thief,  it  was  perfected  in  a new  manner  in 
the  martyr.” 

This  penitent  thief,  again,  is  termed  by  S.  Athanasius  an  evangelist. 
“ O Thou  excellent  one ! Thou  wast  crucified  as  a thief,  thou  comest 
forth  suddenly  as  an  evangelist”  He  is  called  by  S.  Chrysostom  in 
his  Sermon  on  Parasc.,  “a  prophet,”  that  is  a preacher  and 
enunciator  of  the  greatness  of  Christ.  “ O the  might  of  Jesus  I ” he 
says,  “the  thief  is  now  a prophet  and  preaches  from  the  cross  1”  He 
calls  him  “a  robber  and  seizer  of  paradise.”  “Thou  sawest,”  He 
says,  “how  he  did  not  forget  his  former  craft,  even  on  the  cross, 
but,  by  his  confession,  stole  the  kingdom.”  So  Sedulius  ( Carm . v. 
on  Pasch) : 

“ Abstulit  ipse  snis  coelorum  regna  rapinis,” 

**  And  be  the  heavenly  kingdom  took  by  force.**

S.  Cyril  (lib,  ii.  de  Adoration*)  and  S.  P.  Damianus  (Serna,  on  the 
Exaltation  of  the  Holy  Cross)  calls  him  the  first-fruit  of  the  cross 
and  of  believers.  Christ  is  thus  pointed  out  by  Drogo:  “Thou 
wert  Peter  on  the  cross,  and  Peter  in  the  house  of  Caiaphas  was 
the  thief/  because  he  denied  Christ,  whom  the  thief  on  the  cross 
confessed  before  the  people.  He  is  called  by  S.  Cyprian,  or  who- 
ever is  the  author  of  the  Sermon  de  Passione9  “The  colleague  of 
the  martyrdom  of  Christ”  By  Arnold,  abbot  of  Bona  Vallis,  (tract 
de  verb . Christ) : “The  comrade”  (collaterals)  “of  Christ,  and  the 
forerunner  of  His  victory.”  By  S.  Chrysostom  (Homily  on  the  Man 
Born  Blind) : “ The  advocate  of  Christ,  because  he  defended  Him 
against  the  Jews,  like  an  advocate.”  By  Anastasius  the  Sinaite 
lib.  v.  Hexam.)9  “The  bird  of  heaven,  the  great  eagle,  flying  through 
the  air  to  paradise.”  S.  Athanasius  classes  together  many  eulogies 
in  his  aforesaid  piece  on  Parasc: — Among  other  things  he  says, 
“O  thief,  fellow  soldier  of  Christ,  accuser  of  the  Jews.  O thief, 
merchant  of  the  kingdom,  keeper  of  paradise.  O thief,  the  garland, 
as  it  were,  of  the  cross,  making  a heaven  for  thyself.  O thief, 
teaching  men  how  to  carry  off  a kingdom  as  if  by  theft  O 
thief,  the  last  to  come,  the  first  to  be  crowned.  O thief,  mighty 
accuser  of  the  Jews.  O thief,  colleague  (symmista)  of  the  Apostles, 
purchaser  of  Christ  1”  Hear  S.  Paulinus  in  his  Panegyric  of  the 
youth  Celsus : 


Moeror  abi  I discede  pavor  I fuge  culpa, 
ruit  mors. 

Vita  resurrexit,  Christus  in  astra  vocat

Christ's  promise  to  the  thief.  $<m 

Christ  answered  S.  Bridget  when  she  prayed  for  a penitent  sinner 
who  had  no  means  of  confession,  in  these  words:  “He  laments 
because  he  has  none  to  hear  his  confession ; tell  him  that  the  will  is 
sufficient  For  what  benefited  the  thief  on  the  cross  ? Was  it  not 
his  good  will?  Or  what  opened  heaven  to  him  but  his  wish  to 
desire  good  and  hate  evil  ? What  makes  hell  but  an  evil  inclination 
and  inordinate  concupiscence  ? ” This  is  found  in  the  sixth  book  of 
the  Revelations  of  S.  Bridget,  chap.  115.  See  further,  T.  Reynaud 
in  a learned  work  he  wrote  on  the  change  of  the  thief  into  an 
Apostle — where,  chap,  xvii.,  he  says,  “ He  formed  figurative  honey 
by  Christian  bees,  which  they  gathered  from  the  meadows  of  the 
holy  thief.” 

Ver.  43. — And  Jesus  said  unto  him.  Verily  1 say  unto  thee>  This 
day  shalt  thou  be  with  Me  in  Paradise.  That  is,  in  a place  of  pleasure 
where  thou  mayest  be  in  the  beatitude  and  beatific  vision  of  God, 
i.e.  To-day  I will  make  thee  for  ever  happy ; I will  make  thee  a 
king  reigning  in  the  kingdom  of  glory  with  me  this  day.  So  S. 
Cyril  of  Jerusalem  ( Catechet . Led.  c.  13) ; S.  Chrysostom  (Hon t.  ii. 
de  Cruce  et  Latrone) ; S.  Gregory  of  Nyssa  (Serm.  on  the  Resurrec- 
tion) ; S.  Augustine  (Tract.  1 11  on  John).  He  explains  paradise  by 
heaven,  that  is  celestial  beatitude.  It  is  certain  that  Christ  on  the 
day  on  which  He  died,  did  not  go  up  to  heaven  with  the  thief,  but 
went  down  into  the  Limbus  Patrum  (S.  Augustine  Lib.  ii.  de  Genese  ad 
litt.  chap.  34;  and  Maldonatus  by  paradise  here  understand  Abraham’s 
bosom),  and  imparted  to  them  the  vision  of  His  Godhead  and  thus 
made  them  blest,  changing  the  order  of  things ; for  He  then  made 
limbus  to  be  paradise,  and  the  lower  parts  the  upper,  so  that  hell 
should  be  heavea  For  where  Christ  is,  there  is  paradise ; where, 
the  vision  and  beatitude  of  God,  there,  heaven.  For,  as  to  what 
Euthymius  and  other  Greeks  say,  denying  that  the  souls  of  the 
saints  see  God  before  the  judgment  and  are  happy:  by  paradise 
they  understand  an  earthly  place ; that  to  which  Enoch  was  carried. 
But  it  cannot  be  so— for  it  is  of  the  faith  that  Christ,  shortly  after 
His  death  went  down  in  infemum — that  is,  the  limbus  of  the 
Fathers,  but  He  did  not  go  into  any  earthly  paradise.  It  is,  more-

over,  uncertain  whether,  after  the  Deluge,  there  be  any  earthly 
paradise  remaining.  But  grant  that  there  be  such,  it  is  the  happy 
and  joyful  habitation,  not  of  souls,  but  of  bodies  only.  Hence  it  is 
plain  from  this  passage,  against  the  Greeks,  Calvin,  and  the  other 
innovators,  that  the  souls  of  the  saints,  when  thoroughly  purged 
from  sin,  do  not  sleep  till  the  day  of  judgment,  but  there  behold 
God,  and  are  beatified  by  a vision  of  Him. 

Moraliter.  Observe  here  the  liberality  of  Christ,  who  exceeds  our 
prayers  and  vows.  The  thief  only  prayed  Christ  to  remember  him 
when  He  came  into  His  kingdom.  Christ  at  the  same  time 
promised  him  a kingdom,  that  he  might  reign  in  it  as  a king. 
“This  day,”  says  Eusebius  of  Emissa,  in  his  “Homily  on  the 
Blessed  Thief” — “as  if  He  would  say,  O my  faithful  companion 
and  one  only  witness  of  so  great  a triumph,  dost  thou  think  that  I 
need  to  be  so  earnestly  entreated  to  remember  thee?  this  day  shah 
thou  be  with  Me  in  paradise.”  And  again,  “Christ  when  placed  in 
the  yoke  (patibulum)  as  an  arbiter  between  the  two  condemned, 
rejected  him  who  denied,  and  received  the  one  who  confessed ; on 
the  latter  He  bestows  a kingdom,  the  former  He  leaves  in  helL 
Let  us  then  believe  that  He  will  come  to  judge,  whom  we  see  to 
have  already  on  the  cross  exercised  judgment”  This  is  that  most 
sweet  answer  of  Christ  to  the  thief  which  Fulgenthis  {serin.  nov.  60), 
calls  “ the  testament  of  Christ,  written  with  the  pen  of  the  cross.” 

Lastly,  the  name  of  this  most  blessed  thief  is  said  to  have  been 
Dismas,  for  some  chapels  are  found,  in  the  name  of  “ Dismas  the 
Robber.”  His  day  in  the  Catalogue  of  Saints  is  the  25th  March, 
for  on  that  day  he  seems  to  have  suffered,  and  Christ  in  consequence 
on  the  same  day.  For  we  find  in  it,  “At  Jerusalem,  the  commemo- 
ration of  the  holy  thief  who  confessed  Christ  on  the  cross,  and 
who  therefore  merited  to  hear  ‘This  day  shalt  thou  be  with  Me  in 
paradise.1 "

CHRIST’S  DYING  EXCLAMATION.

says,  “ When  Christ  said  on  the  cross,  Father,  into  Thy  hands  I 
commend  My  Spirit,  He  commends  all  men  to  the  Father,  to  be, 
by  Him  and  through  Him,  restored  to  life ; for  we  are  members, 
and  those  many  members  are  one  body,  which  is  the  Church.  He 
commends  therefore  all  who  are  in  Him  to  God.”  Christ  therefore, 
according  to  S.  Athanasius,  calls  men  His  soul  and  spirit  What 
then  ought  we  not  to  do  to  profit  and  save  souls,  that  we  ifiay  keep 
as  it  were  for  Christ,  His  soul  and  spirit?  So  S.  Paul  to  Philemon 
and  Onesimus,  “His  bowels.”  “He  gave  His  life,”  says  S.  Cyril,  “into 
the  hands  of  His  Father  {Lib.  11  on  John  chap,  xxxvi.),  that  by 
this  and  through  this,  as  a beginning,  we  might  have  certain  hope  of 
this,  firmly  believing  that  we  shall  be  in  the  hands  of  God  after  our 
death.”  So  Victor  Antiochus  on  S.  Mark,  “ This  recommendation  of 
Christ  tends  to  the  good  of  our  souls,  which,  when  freed  from  the 
bodies  previously  inhabited  by  them,  He  gave  by  these  words,  as  a 
kind  of  deposit,  into  the  hands  of  the  living  God”  And  Euthymius : 
“God  did  this  for  us,  that  the  souls  of  the  just  should  not  henceforth 
go  down  into  hell,  but  should  rather  ascend  to  God.”  He  cites  Ps. 
xxxi.  5,  when  David,  afflicted  and  in  danger  of  death,  spoke  as 
much  in  his  own  person  as  in  that  of  Christ  and  said,  “into  Thy 
hands  I commend  my  spirit.”  And,  from  this,  the  Church  daily 
uses  the  same  Psalm  and  verse,  and  sings  it  in  the  Compline  at 
night,  to  teach  us,  when  we  retire  to  rest,  to  commend  our  souls 
to  God,  because  at  night  we  run  many  risks  of  sudden  death.  The 
dying  use  the  same  words,  as  did  S.  Nicholas,  Louis  King  of  France, 
and  S.  Basil.  S.  Basil  did  it  in  the  presence  of  angels,  who  brought 
him  away ; as  S.  Gregory  Nazianzen  testifies  in  his  oration  on  him. 
S.  Stephen  also  cried,  “ Lord  Jesus,  receive  my  spirit” 

By  these  words  we  testify — 1.  That  at  our  birth  we  received  our 
souls,  not  from  our  father  and  mother,  but  from  God  alone ; and 
that  we  therefore  give  Him  back  the  same,  as  His  own  creatures. 
2.  That  we  believe  that  our  souls  do  not  die  at  our  death,  but 
survive  and  are  immortal,  and  return  to  God  who  gave  them  and 
who  will  judge  them.  3.  That  we  believe  in  the  resurrection  of  the 
flesh.  For  in  death  we  commend  our  souls  to  God  that  He  may

keep  them,  as  it  were  as  a deposit,  and  restore  them  again  at  the 
resurrection  to  our  bodies.  4.  That  in  the  last  agony  which  we 
undergo,  most  bitterly,  from  the  devils,  we  implore  the  assistance  of 
God,  that  in  giving  back  our  souls  to  Him,  we  may  overcome  and 
triumph  over  the  devil.  Hence  many  think  that  each  of  us  has  his 
own  peculiar  devil,  who  appears  to  the  dying  in  some  terrible  form, 
and  tempts  them  to  despair,  and  to  other  sins,  as  he  did  to  S. 
Martha  and  others,  but  not  to  all.  S.  Ephrem  seems  to  think  this 
in  his  sermon  on  those  who  sleep  in  Christ  S.  Chrysostom  (Horn. 
34  on  S.  Matt),  and  others  whom  our  own  Lorinus  cites  on  Eccles 
viii.  8.  Many  think  the  same  of  Christ  Hence  Eusebius  {Demon- 
strate Lib . iv.  cap.  uli.)  understands  Christ’s  words,  Ps.  xxii.  12, 
“ Many  strong  bulls  of  Basan  have  beset  me  round,”  of  devils  whom 
Christ  saw,  mocking  Him  on  the  cross  as  a criminal  and  wicked,  and 
insulting  Him  for  His  crucifixion  and  impending  death.  Habakkuk 
seems  to  support  this  idea,  iii.  5 : “ Burning  coals  ” (diabolus)  went 
forth  at  His  feet and  S.  John,  xiv.  30 : “The  prince  of  this  world 
cometh,  and  he  hath  nothing  in  Me.”  Christ  lays  down  His  Spirit 
therefore  into  the  hands  of  God,  certain  that  no  one  can  sever  Him 
from  it.  For  God  is  a most  faithful  and  strong  protector.  So  S. 
Jerome  on  Psalm  xxxi.  5,  “Into  Thy  hands  I cpmmend  my  spirit” 
That  is,  “ into  Thy  power.”  This  example  the  Church  received  from 
Christ,  and  S.  Stephen  followed  it  The  saints  when  departing,  use 
the  same  words;  as  the  following:  “They  commend  their  souls  to 
the  faithful  Creator  for  His  good  acts ; ” our  Lord  said  this,  when 
hanging  on  the  cross,  commending  His  Spirit  to  the  hands  of  the 
Father  as  being  to  receive  it  again  at  the  resurrection. 

Symbolically , Didymus  in  his  Catena  on  Psalm  xxxi.  “The  spirit 
is  threefold — 1.  Our  thought  2.  Our  souL  3.  Our  conscience. 
These  three  we  ought  to  commend  to  God.” 

And  having  said  thusy  He  gave  up  the  ghost  The  Syriac  “ He 
said  this,  and  ended,”  His  life,  that  is.  The  Arabic,  “ And  when  He 
had  said  this  He  gave  up  His  Spirit”  This  was  a certain  sign  that 
He  was  the  Son  of  God  the  Father,  who  was  called  upon  by  Him, 
and  that  the  Father  heard  the  cry  of  the  Son  and  received  His  souL

CHRIST  YIELDS  UP  HIS  SPIRIT.  505 

M For  when  He  had  said,  * Father,  into  Thy  hands  I commend  My 
Spirit ;*  then,  at  last,  He  suffered  death  to  come  to  Him.”  Says 
Euthymius,  on  Matt,  xxvii : “ As  certainly  knowing  that  the  spirit, 
placed  in  His  hands  as  a deposit,  the  Father  would  keep  securely, 
and  would  give  back  in  the  resurrection  on  the  third  day.  Firm  in 
this  hope  He  gladly  and  with  alacrity  rendered  up  His  Spirit  to  the 
Father.”

CHAPTER  XXIV. 

I  Christ's  resurrection  is  declared  by  two  angels  to  the  women  that  come  to  tho 
sepulchre . 9 These  report  it  to  others,  13  Christ  himself  appeareth  to  the  two 
disciples  that  went  to  Emmaus  : 36  afterwards  he  appeareth  to  the  apostles , 
and  reproveth  their  unbelief:  47  giveth  them  a charge:  49  promiselh  the  l/oly 
Ghost:  51  and  so  ascendeth  into  heaven, 

NOW  upon  the  first  day  of  the  week,  very  early  in  the  morning,  they  came  unto 
the  sepulchre,  bringing  the  spices  which  they  had  prepared,  and  certain 
others  with  them. 

2  And  they  found  the  stone  rolled  away  from  the  sepulchre. 

3  And  they  entered  in,  and  found  not  the  body  of  the  Lord  Jesus. 

4  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed  thereabout,  behold,  two 
men  stood  by  them  in  shining  garments : 

5  And  as  they  were  afraid,  and  bowed  down  their  faces  to  the  earth,  they  said 
unto  them,  Why  seek  ye  the  living  among  the  dead? 

6  He  is  not  here,  but  is  risen : remember  how  he  spake  unto  you  when  he  was 
yet  in  Galilee, 

7  Saying,  the  Son  of  man  must  be  delivered  into  the  hands  of  sinful  men,  and 
be  crucified,  and  the  third  day  rise  again. 

8  And  they  remembered  his  words, 

9  And  returned  from  the  sepulchre,  and  told  all  these  things  unto  the  eleven, 
and  to  all  the  rest. 

10  It  was  Mary  Magdalene,  and  Joanna,  and  Mary  the  mother  of  James,  and 
other  women  that  were  with  them,  which  told  these  things  unto  the  apostles. 

11  And  their  words  seemed  to  them  as  idle  tales,  and  they  believed  them  not. 

12  Then  arose  Peter,  and  ran  unto  the  sepulchre ; and  stooping  down,  he  be- 
held the  linen  clothes  laid  by  themselves,  and  departed,  wondering  in  himself  at 
that  which  was  come  to  pass. 

13  T And,  behold,  two  of  them  went  that  same  day  to  a village  called  Emmaus, 
which  was  from  Jerusalem  about  threescore  furlongs. 

14  And  they  talked  together  of  all  these  things  which  had  happened. 

15  And  it  came  to  pass,  that,  while  they  communed  together  and  reasoned,  Jesus 
himself  drew  near,  and  went  with  them. 

16  But  their  eyes  were  holden  that  they  should  not  know  him. 

17  And  he  said  unto  them.  What  manner  of  communications  are  these  that  ye 
have  one  to  another,  as  ye  walk,  and  are  sad? 

18  And  the  one  of  them,  whose  name  was  Cleopas,  answering  said  unto  him, 
Art  thou  only  a stranger  in  Jerusalem,  and  hast  not  known  the  things,  which  are 
come  to  pass  there  in  these  days?

19  And  he  said  onto  them,  What  things?  And  they  said  unto  him,  Concerning 
Jesus  of  Nazareth,  which  was  a prophet  mighty  in  deed  and  word  before  God  and 
all  the  people  : 

20  And  how  the  chief  priests  and  our  rulers  delivered  him  to  be  condemned  to 
death,  and  have  crucified  him. 

21  But  we  trusted  that  it  had  been  he  which  should  have  redeemed  Israel : and 
beside  all  this,  to  day  is  the  third  day  since  these  things  were  done. 

22  Yea,  and  certain  women  also  of  our  company  made  us  astonished,  which 
were  early  at  the  sepulchre  ; 

23  And  when  they  found  not  his  body,  they  came,  saying,  that  they  had  also 
seen  a vision  of  angels,  which  said  that  he  was  alive. 

24  And  certain  of  them  which  were  with  us  went  to  the  sepulchre,  and  found  it 
even  so  as  the  women  had  said  : but  him  they  saw  not. 

25  Then  he  said  unto  them,  O fools,  and  slow  of  heart  to  believe  all  that  the 
prophets  have  spoken : 

26  Ought  not  Christ  to  have  suffered  these  things,  and  to  enter  into  his  glory  ? 

27  And  beginning  at  Moses  and  all  the  prophets,  he  expounded  unto  them  in 
all  the  scriptures  the  things  concerning  himself. 

28  And  they  drew  nigh  unto  the  village,  whither  they  went : and  he  made  as 
• though  he  would  have  gone  further. 

29  But  they  constrained  him,  saying,  Abide  with  us : for  it  is  toward  evening, 
and  the  day  is  far  spent.  And  he  went  in  to  tarry  with  them. 

30  And  it  came  to  pass,  as  he  sat  at  meat  with  them,  he  took  bread,  and 
blessed  it,  and  brake  and  gave  to  them. 

31  And  their  eyes  were  opened,  and  they  knew  him ; and  be  vanished  out  of 
their  sight. 

32  And  they  said  one  to  another,  Did  not  our  heart  burn  within  us,  while  he 
talked  with  us  by  the  way,  and  while  he  opened  to  us  the  scriptures? 

33  And  they  rose  up  the  same  hour,  and  returned  to  Jerusalem,  and  found  the 
eleven  gathered  together,  and  them  that  were  with  them, 

34  Saying,  The  Lord  is  risen  indeed,  and  hath  appeared  to  Simon. 

35  And  they  told  what  things  were  done  in  the  way,  and  how  he  was  known  of 
them  in  breaking  of  bread. 

36  U And  as  they  thus  spake,  Jesus  himself  stood  in  the  midst  of  them,  and 
saith  unto  them,  Peace  be  unto  you. 

37  But  they  were  terrified  and  affrighted,  and  supposed  that  they  had  seen  a 
spirit. 

38  And  he  said  unto  them.  Why  are  ye  troubled  ? and  why  do  thoughts  arise 
In  your  hearts? 

39  Behold  my  hands  and  my  feet,  that  it  is  I myself : handle  me,  and  see,  for 
a spirit  hath  not  flesh  and  bones,  as  you  see  me  have. 

40  And  when  he  had  thus  spoken,  he  showed  them  his  hands  and  his  feet. 

41  And  while  they  yet  believed  not  for  joy,  and  wondered,  he  said  unto  them, 
Have  ye  here  any  meat  ? 

42  And  they  gave  him  a piece  of  broiled  fish,  and  of  an  honeycomb. 

43  And  he  took  it,  and  did  eat  before  them. 

44  And  he  said  unto  them,  These  are  the  words  which  I spake  unto  you,  while 
I was  yet  with  you,  that  all  things  must  be  fulfilled,  which  were  written  in  the  law 
of  Moses,  and  in  the  prophets,  and  in  the  psalms,  concerning  me.

45  Then  opened  he  their  understanding,  that  they  might  understand  the  scrip- 
tures, 

46  And  said  unto  them,  Thus  it  is  written,  and  thus  it  behoved  Christ  to  suffer, 
and  to  rise  from  the  dead  the  third  day  : 

47  And  that  repentance  and  remission  of  sins  should  be  preached  in  his  name 
among  all  nations,  beginning  at  Jerusalem. 

48  And  ye  are  witnesses  of  these  things. 

49  IT  And,  behold,  I send  the  promise  of  my  Father  upon  you : but  tarry  ye  in 
the  city  of  Jerusalem,  until  ye  be  endued  with  power  from  on  high. 

50  IT  And  he  led  them  out  as  far  as  to  Bethany,  and  he  lifted  up  his  hands,  and 
blessed  them. 

51  And  it  came  to  pass,  while  he  blessed  them,  he  was  parted  from' them,  and 
carried  up  into  heaven. 

52  And  they  worshipped  him,  and  returned  to  Jerusalem  with  great  joy ; 

53  And  were  continually  in  the  temple,  praising  and  blessing  God.  Amen.

thorns,  and  wills  that  wives  should  win  over  their  husbands,  and  that

Ver.  13. — And,  behold,  two  of  them  went  that  same  day  to  a village 
called  Emmaus , &c.  These  two  are  generally  considered  to  be  the 
same  as  those  mentioned  by  S.  Mark  xvi.  12,  but  Euthymius  is  of  a 
different  opinion,  and  argues  that  the  Apostles  believed  these  (see 
verse  34),  whereas  S.  Mark,  xvi.  13,  expressly  states  that  those  spoken 
of  by  him,  “ went  and  told  it  unto  the  residue : neither  believed  they 
them.”  But  I answer  that  most  of  them  believed,  although  some,  as 
Thomas,  doubted. 

You  ask,  who  were  these  two?  I answer,  one  was  Cleopas, 
but  that  it  is  uncertain  about  the  other.  S.  Ambrose  thinks  he  was 
called  Amaon,  because  he  was  a native  of  Emmaus.  Origen  calls 
him  Simeon.  S.  Epiphanius  considers  him  to  be  the  Nathanael  men-

TWO  DISCIPLES  JOURNEY  TO  EMMAUS.  509 

Luke  had  never  seen  Christ  in  the  flesh,  and  that  he  was  converted 
after  the  death  of  the  Lord. 

Two  of  them , i.e.  of  the  disciples,  went  probably  on  some  matter 
of  business,  and  also  for  the  purpose  of  diverting  their  thoughts 
from  the  sad  subject  of  their  Master’s  passion. 

Threescore  furlongs , eradms  i.e.,  125  paces,  the  eighth  part  of 
a Roman  mile. 

Called  Emmaus.  Emmaus  was  a village  in  the  time  of  Christ, 
according  to  S.  Jerome  the  birthplace  of  Cleopas ; who  seems  now 
to  have  gone  thither  for  some  family  reason.  In  the  Hebrew  the 
name  may  mean,  according  to  its  spelling,  “fear”  or  “ardour.” 
Each  meaning  is  here  very  appropriate,  for  these  two  disciples  were 
of  a timorous  disposition,  but  when  the  love  of  Christ  was  kindled 
in  their  hearts,  their  fear  gave  place  to  burning  zeal  Others  take 
ijifAavs  as  equivalent  to  D1ND  W am  maus,  “a  people  rejected,” 
and  explain  that  the  two  disciples,  because  of  their  doubtings  and 
distrust,  were  drawing  nigh  unto  rejection,  but  were  recalled  by 
Christ  and  sent  back  to  the  chosen  Apostles  in  Jerusalem. 

Some  say  that  this  Emmaus,  after  the  capture  of  Jerusalem  by 
the  Romans,  was  enlarged  and  called  Nicopolis,  of  which  Sozo- 
men  writes,  " Before  the  village,  where  the  roads  meet,  when  Christ 
made  as  though  He  would  have  gone  further,  is  a healing  spring,  in 
which  not  only  men,  but  also  animals  suffering  from  manifold 
diseases,  seek  relief.  For  they  say  that  Christ  came  thither  with 
the  disciples,  and  washed  His  feet  therein,  from  which  time  its 
waters  have  possessed  healing  power.”  He  adds  something  similar 
about  a tree  near  Hermopolis,  the  leaves,  fruit,  and  bark  of  which 
cure  many  diseases,  because  it  bent  in  adoration  as  Christ  passed 
on  his  flight  into  Egypt. 

Many  are  of  opinion  that  there  were  two  places  known  by  the 
name  of  Emmaus,  one,  the  city  afterwards  called  Nicopolis,  about 
140  stadia  from  Jerusalem,  the  other  the  village  mentioned  in  the 
text

burial  of  their  Master,  grieving  that  so  great  a prophet  had  suffered 
so  unworthily,  and  sorrowing  because  they  would  see  Him  no  more ; 
for  they  evidently  despaired  of  his  resurrection  and  of  the  redemp- 
tion of  Israel. 

Ver.  15. — And  it  came  to  pass , &c.  Jesus  teaches  here  that  He  is 
present  with  those  who  speak  concerning  Him.  Let  us  then  speak 
of  Jesus,  and  He  will  be  present  with  us  also,  and  take  part  in  our 
communings : not  indeed  now  in  bodily  form,  but  spiritually,  by  the 
grace  of  His  Holy  Spirit,  by  which  He  inspires  our  hearts.  For  this 
much  He  Himself  has  promised,  saying,  “ Where  two  or  three  are 
gathered  together  in  My  name,  there  am  I in  the  midst  of  them,” 
S.  Matt,  xviii.  20.  They  therefore  that  speak  of  good  have  Jesus  in 
their  midst  They  who  speak  of  evil,  Satan.  Of  this  there  can  be 
no  doubt 

Ver.  16. — But  their  eyes  were  holden . You  will  ask.  How  was  this 
effected  ? 

1.  Dionysius  the  Carthusian  replies,  and  S.  Augustine  {lib.  xxii.  chap.9 
De  Crvit.)  favours  his  opinion,  that  they  were  struck  with  blindness  like 
the  men  of  Sodom,  Gen.  xix.  1 1.  But  this  can  hardly  be  true,  for  they 
saw  Christ,  and  conversed  with  Him,  although  they  knew  Him  not 

2.  Cajetan  thinks  that  their  eyes  were  holden  because  their  minds 
were  so  preoccupied,  and  taken  up  with  the  events  which  had  come 
to  pass.  But  the  words  of  S.  Mark  xvi.  1 2,  “ He  appeared  in  another 
form”  are  against  this  view. 

3.  S.  Augustine  {Epist.  59,  Quasi . viii.)  is  of  opinion  that  some 
change  had  come  over  the  countenance  of  Christ,  as  at  the 
transfiguration.  But  this  does  not  accord  with  the  dignity  of  his 
glorified  body,  which  is  changeless  and  everlasting.  Later  on, 
Augustine  {De  Consens . Evang . iii.  chap.  25)  changed  his  opinion 
and  says  that  the  eyes  of  the  disciples  were  clouded  over  by  Satan, 
or  a darkness  of  some  kind  cast  upon  them,  so  that  they  might  not 
recognise  Christ.  But,  like  as  He  appeared  to  the  Magdalen  in  the 
form  of  a gardener,  so  he  appeared  to  the  two  disciples  in  another 
form.  The  circumstances  of  His  appearance  were  in  accordance 
with  His  will  and  uninfluenced  by  the  action  of  Satan.

u THEIR  EYES  WERE  HOLDEN.”  511 

I say,  therefore,  that  they  did  not  know  the  Lord,  because  although 
the  body  of  Christ  is  unchanged,  yet  because  it  was  glorified  and 
united  to  the  divine  Word  it  possessed  the  power  both  of  withdraw- 
ing itself  from  view,  and  also  of  affecting  the  sight  of  beholders 
either  by  appearing  in  a different  form,  by  changing  the  medium  as 
mirrors  do,  and  even  by  a direct  change  of  vision.  For  this  is  what  S. 
Luke  says,  “ their  eyes  were  holden,”  by  Jesus,  just  as  if  they  had  been 
covered  by  a veil  so  that  they  were  unable  to  exercise  their  functions. 
Hence  immediately  that  Jesus  willed,  they  recognised  Him. 

It  is  much  more  easy  to  account  for  the  fact  that  the  disciples  did 
not  recognise  the  voice  of  Christ,  for  many  without  any  difficulty  so 
change  the  sound  of  their  voices  as  to  appear  other  than  they  are. 
S.  Thomas,  Suarez,  and  others. 

There  are  several  reasons  why  Christ  appeared  in  another  form  to 
these  disciples. 

1.  Because  Christ  and  the  angels  when  they  appear  to  men  make 
themselves  like  those  to  whom  they  appear.  The  two  disciples  were 
journeying  : Christ  therefore  appeared  to  them  as  a wayfarer.  They 
were  in  doubt  concerning  Him : therefore  He  made  as  if  He  were  a 
stranger.  So  S.  Augustine  (de  Consens . Evang.  iii  35)  and  S.  Gregory 
(hom.  23  in  Evang.)  say,  “The  Lord  did  that  outwardly  in  the  eyes 
of  the  body  which  was  done  by  themselves  inwardly  in  the  eyes  of  the 
mind.  For  they  themselves  inwardly  both  loved  and  doubted,  but  to 
them  the  Lord  was  present  outwardly,  although  He  did  not  reveal  him- 
self. To  them,  therefore,  as  they  talked  of  Him  He  exhibited  His  pre- 
sence, but  as  they  doubted  of  Him  He  concealed  the  appearance  which 
they  knew.  He  indeed  conversed  with  them,  upbraided  them  with 
their  hardness  of  heart,  expounded  the  mysteries  of  holy  Scripture 
which  referred  to  Himself,  yet  because  in  their  hearts  He  was  a 
stranger  to  their  faith,  He  made  as  though  He  would  have  gone 
further.” 

2.  Lest,  if  He  at  once  manifested  himself  to  the  disciples  they 
might  be  overcome  by  the  novelty  and  newness  of  His  resurrection, 
and  imagine  that  they  saw  not  Christ  but  a phantom,  and  therefore 
might  remain  doubtful  whether  He  had  risen  from  the  dead.  But

now  since  He  had  conversed  with  them  for  some  time,  and  then 
made  Himself  known,  they  could  no  longer  doubt  that  He  had  risen 
from  the  dead. 

3.  “ That  the  disciples  might  lay  bare  their  sorrows  and  be  cured 
of  their  doubt”  Theophylact  For  if  He  had  at  once  said  that  He 
was  Christ,  they  would  not  have  dared  to  confess  that  they  had  been 
doubtful  of  the  resurrection. 

4.  That  from  the  circumstances  of  His  appearance  He  might  teach 
us  that  we  are  pilgrims  and  strangers,  seeking  an  heavenly  country, 
which  we  should  be  ever  longing  for,  and  strive  our  utmost  to  obtain. 
Wherefore  S.  Francis,  who  happened  on  a certain  occasion  to  be 
spending  his  Easter  in  a monastery,  where  there  were  none  of  whom 
he  could  ask  charity,  mindful  of  our  Lord’s  appearance  to  the  two 
disciples  in  the  form  of  a stranger  on  that  very  day,  asked  alms  of 
the  brothers  themselves ; and  when  he  had  received  their  alms,  in  a 
burst  of  sacred  eloquence,  he  reminded  them  with  all  humility,  that 
on  their  way  through  the  desert  of  this  world  as  strangers  and 
pilgrims,  like  the  true  Israel  they  should  in  all  lowliness  of  mind 
continue  to  celebrate  the  Passover  of  the  Lord,  i.e.  their  passage 
from  this  world  to  the  Father ; and  he  went  on  to  inform  them  that 
it  is  the  pilgrim’s  rule  to  seek  shelter  under  the  roof  of  others,  to 
thirst  for  their  own  country;  and  peacefully  journey  thereunto. 
(Chronicle  of  the  order  of  S.  Francis). 

Ver.  17. — And  He  said  unto  them.  What  manner  of  communications 
are  these  that  ye  have  one  to  another , as  ye  walk  and  are  sadt 
*xv4gwr»/,  “ sullen  ” in  the  sense  of  downcast.  Christ  knew  whence 
their  sadness  arose,  but  asks  them  the  cause,  in  order  that  He 
might  remove  it : “Asl  followed  I heard  you  speak  of  some  one 
who  was  slain  at  Jerusalem ; tell  me  therefore  who  he  was,  and  how, 
and  for  what  reason  he  was  put  to  death.” 

Ver.  18. — And  one  of  them , whose  name  was  Cleopas , answering 
said , &c.  This  Cleopas  was  the  brother  of  S.  Joseph,  the  husband 
of  the  Blessed  Virgin,  the  father  of  S.  James  the  less,  and  S.  Jude, 
and  the  grandfather  of  S.  James  the  greater  and  S.  John,  who  were 
the  sons  of  Salome,  the  daughter  of  Cleopas.  See  chap,  iii  23.

JESUS  QUESTIONS  THE  TWO  DISCIPLES. 


513 


Helecas,  Bishop  of  Caesarea,  tells  us  on  the  authority  of  S.  Jerome, 
that  “Cleopas,  or  Alphaeus,  was  the  brother  of  S.  Joseph,  and 
one  of  the  seventy  disciples,  and  that  he  was  slain  by  the  Jews  in 
the  castle  of  Emmaus  because  of  Christ”  He  was  therefore  a 
martyr.  Hence,  in  the  Roman  Martyrology,  the  25th  of  September 
is  put  down  as  the  birthday  of  Blessed  Cleopas,  the  disciple  of 
Christ,  who  they  say  was  slain  by  the  Jews  for  confessing  the  faith 
in  the  very  house  in  which  he  had  entertained  the  Lord.  See  also 
Dorotheus  (Lives  of  the  Patriarchs). 

Again,  Cleopas,  in  the  Greek  KXiowaf,  is  the  same  as  “ a 11  glory,” 
for  the  Jews  who  were  subjugated  by  Alexander  and  the  Greeks, 
took  Greek  names.  But  in  the  Hebrew  the  name  may  be  taken  to 
mean  “ adding  to  or  increasing  the  Church,”  for  nSlp,  kehala,  is  an 
assembly  or  church,  and  EDS),  pus,  is  to  multiply.  For  Cleopas  gave 
many  sons  and  daughters  to  the  Church  of  Christ 

Art  thou  only  a stranger  in  Jerusalem  t Theophylact  and  Euthy  mius 
translate  waptxtlg  b 'iigwtfaXibtby  “Art  thou  (only)  a dweller  in  Jeru- 
salem?” Others  render  it,  “Art  thou  (only)  a sojourner  in  Jerusalem?” 
The  meaning  is  “Art  thou  such  a stranger  in  Jerusalem,  and  so  ignorant 
of  what  has  been  done  in  it  to  Jesus  of  Nazareth,  as  to  ask  who 
and  what  he  was,  about  whom  we  are  so  sorrowfully  conversing  ? All 
know  the  circumstances  of  His  crucifixion  and  death,  and  can  talk  of 
nothing  else.  How  is  it  that  thou  only  art  ignorant  of  these  things  ? ” 

Ver.  19. — And  He  said  unto  ihem>  What  things  t Christ  constrains 
them  to  open  their  grief  and  to  confess  their  doubts  as  to  His 
resurrection. 

And  they  said  unto  him , Concerning  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  They 
acknowledge  Him,  says  Bede,  to  be  a great  prophet,  but  they  do 
not  speak  of  Him  as  the  Son  of  God,  either  because  their  faith  was 
imperfect,  or  because  they  feared  lest  they  might  fall  into  the  hands 
of  the  persecuting  Jews.  For  they  knew  not  with  whom  they  were 
speaking,  and  therefore  concealed  what  they  believed  to  be  true. 
Because  they  say  (verse  21)  that  they  trusted  that  it  had  been  he, 
as  being  the  Messiah  and  the  Son  of  God,  which  should  have  re- 
deemed Israel.

Mighty  in  deed  and  in  word.  So  should  every  Christian  be, 
especially  those  who  have  devoted  themselves  to  a religious  life,  or 
have  been  called  to  any  office  in  the  Church.  What  they  preach 
they  should  perform,  and  teach  first  by  example  and  then  by  word. 

Ver.  20. — And  how  the  chief  priests  and  our  rulers  delivered  him, 
&c.  They  do  not  accuse  the  chief  priests  and  the  rulers,  although 
they  were  persuaded  of  the  injustice  of  their  actions.  For  they 
feared  lest  this  stranger  might  be  a spy,  seeking  some  cause  of 
accusation  against  them. 

Ver.  21. — But  we  trusted  that  it  had  been  he  which  should  have 
redeemed  Israel  from  the  power  of  their  enemies,  e.g.,  from  the 
power  of  the  Romans. 

“We  trusted  that  he  had  been  the  Messiah  who  would  have 
restored  the  kingdom  of  Israel  to  the  same,  or  even  greater,  dignity 
than  it  had  possessed  in  the  time  of  David  and  of  Solomon.  But 
now  that  he  has  been  so  unworthily  put  to  death,  although  we  do 
not  despair,  we  have  but  little  hope.” 

This  was  their  grief,  the  wound  which  their  faith  had  received, 
which  Christ  desired  to  hear  from  them,  in  order  to  heaL 

“O  disciples,”  says  S.  Augustine  (serm.  140  De  Temp.\  “ye  were 
hoping,  therefore  ye  do  not  now  hope.  Behold  Christ  lives,  but  your 
hope  within  you  is  dead ; ” and  again,  “ He  was  walking  with  them  as 
their  companion,  and  yet  was  their  leader  and  guide.” 

And  beside  all  this,  to-day  is  the  third  day,  &c.  For  Christ  was 
crucified  on  the  sixth  day,  and  after  three  days  rose  from  the  dead. 
This  is  an  aposiopesis,  for  the  disciples,  anxious  and  perplexed, 
knowing  not  what  to  think  about  Christ,  as  good  as  say,  ( Jesus 
when  He  was  alive  said  that  He  would  rise  from  the  dead  on  the 
third  day ; but  although  this  is  the  third  day  we  know  not  whether 
He  has  risen  or  is  yet  to  rise.”  They  were  doubtful,  balanced  between 
hope  and  fear.  “They  speak  thus,”  says  Theophylact,  “as  men  in 
doubt,  and  seem  to  me  to  be  very  undecided  in  their  minds,  for 
they  are  not  absolutely  unbelieving,  nor  do  they  believe  aright. 
For  their  words  ‘we  trusted  that  it  had  been  he,’  &c,  indicate 
incredulity,  but  when  they  make  mention  of  the  third  day,  they

show  themselves  mindful  of  the  words  of  Christ,  1 on  the  third  day 
I shall  rise  again ; * ” and  again,  “ On  the  whole  they  spake  as  men  in 
perplexity  and  doubt.” 

Ver.  22. — Yea9  and  certain  women  also  of  our  company  made  us 
astonished  (i^tertieap).  For  what  the  women  had  told  inspired 
them  with  awe  rather  than  fear,  and,  says  Theophylact,  “ overthrew 
their  doubting  and  unbelief,  whilst  it  strengthened  their  faith  and 
hope  in  the  resurrection  of  Christ  Their  fear  therefore  struggled 
with  their  hope,  and  between  the  two  they  were  undecided  and  in 
doubt” 

Ver.  25. — Then  said  He  unto  them , O fools . ’Aronro/,  rendered 
here  in  the  Vulgate  “ stulti,”  but  Gal.  iii.  1.,  “ insensati.”  With  these 
keen  words  Christ  as  the  Master  rebukes  the  disciples  for  their 
ignorance  and  slowness  to  believe.  For  a teacher  is  allowed  to 
stimulate  his  disciples  by  sharp  reproof  to  the  pursuit  of  higher  or 
more  accurate  knowledge.  See  S.  Matt  v.  22. 

So  our  nature,  frail  and  dull  of  understanding,  needs  some  such 
stimulus  to  enable  it  to  believe  in  spiritual  things,  and  to  keep  itself 
steadfast  in  the  hope  of  their  realisation. 

Ver.  26. — Ought  not  Christ ...  to  enter  into  His  glory  ? He  calls 
His  glorious  resurrection  and  ascension,  the  sending  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
His  exaltation  over  every  creature,  the  adoration  of  His  name,  the 
spread  of  the  gospel  throughout  all  the  world,  and  His  eternal 
kingdom,  “glory.” 

“Ought  not,”  (“futurum  erat,”  the  Arabic  and  Syriac).  It 
behoved  Christ  through  the  Cross  to  enter  glory : 

1.  Because  the  prophets  had  foretold  it 

2.  Because  God  the  Father  had  decreed  it  from  all  eternity. 

3.  Because  it  was  necessary  that  He  should  purchase  our  redemp- 
tion by  His  death  upon  the  Cross. 

4.  Because  it  was  fitting  that  such  glory  should  be  obtained 
through  the  merit  of  such  sufferings  and  labour. 

5.  Because  it  behoved  Christ,  as  leader,  to  become  an  example  to 
the  martyrs,  and  to  all  those  who  strive  through  much  tribulation  to 
enter  into  the  kingdom  of  heaven.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXIV. 


The  meaning  is,  “ My  death  upon  the  Cross  has  shaken  your  faith 
and  hope  in  My  resurrection,  therefore  ye  said  ‘we  trusted* 
(sperabamus).  But  ye  spake  rashly  and  without  cause.  For  this 
ought  to  have  confirmed  your  faith,  for  there  is  none  other  way  to 
the  resurrection  save  through  death,  nor  to  glory  save  through 
suffering,  and  the  reproach  of  the  Cross.” 

Ver.  28. — And  He  made  as  though  He  would  have  gone  further. 
This  was  no  deceit : for  He  would  have  gone  on  if  the  disciples 
had  not  constrained  Him,  but  as  He  knew  that  they  would  thus 
constrain  Him  to  abide  with  them,  in  this  respect  he  was  not  will- 
ing, but  was  making  as  if  (wfsfivtitto)  He  would  have  gone  further. 

Hence  S.  Augustine  (Quasi.  Evang.)  says,  “When  one  feigning 
has  reference  to  a certain  meaning,  it  is  not  a falsehood,  but  a 
certain  figure  of  the  truth.”  And  again,  “A  fiction  founded  on 
truth  is  a figure ; not  so  founded,  it  is  a lie.”  And  S.  Gregory  (horn. 
23  in  Evang.)  writes,  “ By  the  word  ‘ fingere  * we  mean  to  put  together 
or  form,  hence  modellers  of  clay  we  call  ‘ figuli.’  He  who  was  the 
truth  did  nothing  by  deceit  He  manifested  Himself  to  them  in  the 
body,  such  as  He  came  before  them  in  their  midst  He  would 
prove  them  whether  they  could  show  charity  to  Him  as  a stranger, 
although  they  might  not  yet  love  Him  as  God.” 

Ver.  29. — And  they  constrained  Him.  “ From  which  example  it  is 
gathered,”  says  S.  Gregory,  “ that  strangers  are  not  only  to  be  invited 
to  hospitality,  but  even  to  be  taken  by  force.”  And  S.  Augustine 
adds  (Serm.  140  De  Temp.),  “ Detain  a guest,  if  you  wish  to  recog- 
nise the  Saviour;  for  hospitality  restored  what  unbelief  had  taken 
away.” 

Saying,  Abide  with  us;  for  it  is  towards  evening,  and  the  day  is 
far  spent,  Le.  it  is  drawing  near  sunset  In  order  to  detain  Christ 
as  their  guest  they  exaggerate  the  lateness  of  the  hour,  for  they 
returned  soon  after  to  Jerusalem,  which  was  a three  hours’  journey. 

Cardinal  Hosius  his  whole  life  long  had  these  words  continually 
in  his  heart  and  on  his  lips,  and  died  repeating  often,  “ Abide  with 
us,  O Lord,  for  it  is  toward  evening,”  and  in  truth  the  Lord  abode 
with  him,  working  many  marvels  by  his  means  in  Poland,  in

JESUS  KNOWN  IN  THE  BREAKING  OF  BREAD.  5 1 J 


Germany,  and  in  Italy,  which  are  related  by  his  biographer  Rescius, 
who  ends  by  eulogising  him  as  “ the  atlas  of  religion,  the  voice 
and  other  hand  of  Paul,  the  demolisher  of  Luther,  the  janitor  of 
heaven,  and  the  love  and  admiration  of  the  world” 

Ver.  30. — He  took  bread  and  blessed  it.  He  blessed  it  by  causing 
it  to  become  His  body  as  in  the  consecration  of  the  Eucharist  For 
that  Christ  thus  consecrated  it,  although  Jansenius  and  some  others 
deny  it,  is  clear : 

1.  Because  S.  Matthew,  S.  Mark,  and  S.  Luke  use  the  same 
words  concerning  the  institution  of  the  Eucharist,  as  S.  Luke  uses 
here. 

2.  Because  this  blessing  does  not  appear  to  have  been  given  at 
the  commencement  of  the  meal,  for  Christ  wished  not  to  vanish  out 
of  their  sight  before  He  had  eaten  with  them,  lest  they  might  think 
him  a phantom.  It  was  given  in  the  midst,  or  rather  at  the  end,  of 
the  meaL  It  was  not  therefore  the  ordinary  blessing  on  what  had 
been  provided  for  their  use,  but  solemn  and  eucharistic. 

3.  This  is  clear  also  from  the  effect  which  this  blessing  of  the 
bread  had  upon  the  disciples : “ their  eyes  were  opened  and  they 
knew  Him.” 

4.  Furthermore,  this  is  the  opinion  of  the  great  majority  of  the 
Fathers.  So  the  author  quoted  by  S.  Chrysostom  (Horn.  17)  says, 
“ The  Lord  not  only  blessed  the  bread,  but  gave  it  with  His  own 
hand  to  Cleopas  and  his  companion.  But  that  which  is  given  by 
His  hand  is  not  only  sanctified,  but  sanctification  and  a cause  of 
sanctity  to  the  recipient” 

Again,  “ How  did  the  Lord  will  to  make  Himself  known  ? By 
the  breaking  of  bread.  We  are  content  then ; in  the  breaking  of 
bread  the  Lord  is  made  known  unto  us.  In  no  other  way  is  it  His 
will  to  reveal  Himself.  Therefore,  although  we  shall  not  see  Him 
in  bodily  form,  He  has  given  us  His  flesh  to  eat”  S.  Augustine 
(Serm.  140  De  Temp.). 

This  passage  of  Holy  Scripture  is  a proof  of  the  use  of  one  species 
only  in  the  Eucharist,  for  it  is  clear  that  Christ  neither  consecrated 
nor  gave  the  cup  to  the  disciples.  After  He  had  blessed  the  bread,

and  given  it  to  them,  they  knew  Him,  and  immediately  He  vanished 
out  of  their  sight  S.  Augustine,  Chrysostom,  Bede  and  others. 

Ver.  31. — Their  eyes  were  opened.  “ See  here  the  power  and  effect 
of  the  Eucharist.  It  opens  the  eyes  of  the  mind  to  the  knowledge 
of  Jesus,  and  enables  it  to  comprehend  heavenly  and  divine 
mysteries.  For  the  flesh  of  Christ  possesses  a great  and  illuminative 
power.”  Theophylact  Hence. S.  Augustine  (Serm.  140  De  Temp.) 
says,  “ Whosoever  thou  art  that  believest,  the  breaking  of  bread 
consoles  thee,  the  absence  of  the  Lord  is  no  absence.  Have  faith, 
and  He  whom  thou  seest  not  is  with  thee.” 

Tropologically,  he  goes  on  to  say,  “ By  the  exercise  of  hospitality 
we  come  to  the  knowledge  of  Christ”  Again,  “ Let  him  who  wishes 
to  understand  what  he  has  heard,  put  in  practice  what  he  has 
understood”  “Behold  the  Lord  was  not  known  whilst  He  was 
speaking,  but  when  He  gives  them  to  eat,  He  allows  Himself  to  be 
recognised”  Gregory.  Or  according  to  the  Gloss : “ Truth  is  under- 
stood better  in  operation  than  by  hearing ; and  none  know  Christ 
unless  they  are  partakers  of  His  Body,  ie.  the  Church,  whose  unity 
the  Apostle  commends  in  the  sacrament  of  bread,  saying,  ‘we 
being  many  are  one  bread,  and  one  body.1”  1 Cor.  x.  17. 

And  He  vanished  out  of  their  sight,  afavret  fymrv,  absconditus 
ab  iliiSy  Arabic  version.  Christ  was  present  with  His  disciples,  but 
made  Himself  invisible  to  them : a power  possessed,  as  theologians 
teach  us,  by  His  glorified  body.  So  after  His  resurrection  He  was 
wont  to  appear  to  His  disciples  and  vanish  from  their  midst 
Calvin,  rashly,  denies  this,  and  contrary  to  its  meaning  translates 
&<f><t9Toc  by  “ He  withdrew  Himself.”  He  denies  this  somewhat 
craftily,  lest  he  might  be  compelled  to  acknowledge  that  Christ 
was  present  in  the  Eucharist,  but  hidden  and  invisible. 

The  causes  why  Christ  vanished  out  of  their  sight  directly  He 
was  recognised  by  the  disciples  are  these 2 — 

1.  To  show  that  He  had  risen  from  the  dead,  and  had  become 
glorified.  For  it  is  the  property  of  a glorified  body  to  appear  or 
disappear  at  will.  His  sudden  disappearance  therefore  was  a new 
argument  by  which  Christ  proved  the  truth  of  His  resurrection.

2.  To  teach  that  by  the  resurrection  He  had  passed  from  this 
mortal  life  to  a state  of  glory,  and  therefore  no  longer  held  familiar 
converse  with  men,  but  with  God  and  the  angels. 

3.  To  teach  us  how  we  ought  to  reverence  Christ,  and  those 
blessed  ones  who  have  entered  into  heaven.  For  we  are  bound  to 
render  to  our  glorified  Lord  the  worship  of  latria,  and  to  the  blessed 
saints  that  of  dulia, 

4.  That  the  disciples  might  return  to  the  Apostles,  who  were 
sorrowing  over  the  death  of  Christ,  and  comfort  them  by  the  tidings 
of  His  resurrection  and  appearing. 

Ver.  32. — And  they  said  one  to  another.  Did  not  our  hearts  bum 
within  us  1 This  was  a new  and  certain  proof  that  Christ  was  alive 
from  the  dead.  For  Christ  taught  not  as  Aristotle,  Plato,  and  the 
philosophers,  but  so  as  to  inflame  the  hearts  of  his  hearers  with 
divine  love.  Let  then  all  teachers  and  interpreters  of  Holy 
Scripture  imitate  their  Master,  and  seek  not  only  to  enlighten  the 
understandings  of  those  who  attend  upon  their  teaching,  but  to 
kindle  the  love  of  God  in  their  hearts  as  well.  Let  them  not  be 
content  with  being  as  the  Cherubim,  but  be  also  as  the  Seraphim. 
Let  them  be  as  S.  Francis  and  his  disciple  S.  Bonaventura,  who 
became  known  as  the  “ Seraphic  Doctor.” 

So  David  wrote,  “ Thy  word  is  very  pure  ” ( ignitum , Vulgate), 
Ps.  cm.  140 ; and  Solomon : “ Every  word  of  God  is  pure,”  Prov. 
xxx.  5;  and  Moses:  ((From  His  right  hand  went  a fiery  law,” 
Deut.  xxxiii.  2. 

So  also  Christ  declared,  “ I am  come  to  send  fire  on  the  earth.” 

S.  Luke  xii.  49.  Thus  the  Baptist  “ was  a burning  and  a shining 
light,”  S.  John  v.  35  ; and  Elias  the  prophet  “ stood  up  as  fire,  and 
his  word  burned  like  a lamp,”  Ecclus.  xlviii.  1.  Let  us  be,  each  one, 
an  Ignatius,  a burning  and  fiery  disciple  and  preacher  of  Christ, 
so  that  the  words  of  the  prophet  may  be  true  of  us,  “ Their  appear- 
ance was  like  burning  coals  of  fire,  and  like  the  appearance  of 
lamps.”  “ They  ran  and  returned  as  the  appearance  of  a flash  of 
lightning.” 

Ver.  33. — And  they  rose  up  the  same  hour  (Le.,  immediately  and

without  waiting  to  finish  their  meal)  and  returned  to  Jerusalem,  and 
found  the  eleven  gathered  together.  Actually  there  were  but  ten 
assembled,  for  Thomas  was  absent  and  Judas  had  hanged  himself 
But  the  Apostolic  college  is  spoken  of  as  “the  eleven,”  even  though 
some  of  the  members  may  not  happen  to  be  present 

They  “ returned  ” (wr'vsrp-fyat*)  quickly,  filled  with  an  eager  joy. 

Them  that  were  with  them.  The  other  disciples  who  were  tarrying 
at  Jerusalem  with  the  Apostles. 

Ver.  34. — Saying , The  Lord  has  risen  indeed,  and  has  appeared  unto 
Simon.  Christ  appeared  unto  Peter  before  He  showed  Himself  to 
the  two  disciples  and  the  rest  of  the  Apostles,  because  he  was  peni- 
tent, and  because  he  was  the  prince  of  the  Apostles.  See  verse  36. 

Ver.  35. — How  He  was  known  of  them  in  breaking  of  bread.  S. 
Luke’s  expression  for  the  Eucharist  So  also  S.  Paul,  1 Cor.  x.  16 : 
“The  bread  which  we  break,  is  it  not  the  communion  of  the  body 
of  Christ  ?” 

Ver.  36. — And  as  they  thus  spake,  Jesus  Himself  stood  in  the  midst 
of  them.  In  their  midst,  says  Euthymius,  that  He  might  be  seen  of 
all,  like  as  a shepherd  stands  in  the  midst  of  his  scattered  sheep  to 
gather  them  again  together  around  him.  Ezek.  xxxiv.  12. 

“ Peace  be  unto  you."  This  was  the  ordinary  salutation  of  the 
Hebrews,  who  under  the  name  of  peace  included  prosperity,  health, 
and  every  other  blessing. 

Very  fittingly  does  Christ  grant  them  His  peace,  to  take  the  place 
of  the  fear  and  perturbation  of  mind  which  His  death  had  caused 
them.  For  He  is  the  peace  of  all  His  people,  says  S.  Cyril  Because 
“doing  away  with  every  difficulty,  He  gathered  together  in  one 
the  merits  of  the  Cross,  which  are  peace,  because  all  hindrances  are 
taken  away.”  S.  Chrysostom  on  S.  Matt  xxviil 

Ver.  37. — But  they  . . . supposed  that  they  had  seen  a spirit. 
Because  of  Jesus’  sudden  appearance  in  their  midst  although  the 
doors  were  shut 

Hence  S.  Ambrose  says,  “ Although  Peter  believed  in  the  resurrec- 
tion, yet  it  was  but  natural  that  he  should  be  terrified  and  affrighted 
when  he  saw  that  the  Lord  had  the  power  of  suddenly  presenting

Himself  in  bodily  form,  in  a place  guarded  by  closed  doors,  and 
despite  of  obstructing  walls.” 

Ver.  38. — And  He  said  unto  them , . . . Why  do  thoughts  arise  in 
your  hearts?  ie.  why  do  you  give  way  to  them  and  permit  them  to 
arise?  “These  thoughts,”  says  Augustine  (serm.  69  Dt  Diversis) 
“were  earthly.  For  had  they  been  from  heaven  they  would  have 
descended,  not  ascended,  into  their  hearts.  Thus  Christ  showed 
that  He  knew  the  hearts  of  men,  (xaedtoywerjie,  Acts  L 24)  and  that 
He  was  God.”  Titus  and  Euthymius. 

Ver.  39. — Behold  My  hands  and  My  feet , &c.  If  you  cannot  believe 
your  sight,  believe  your  touch.  Let  your  hands  prove  whether  your 
eyes  have  played  you  false.  S.  Augustine.  For  the  sense  of  touch 
is  more  to  be  relied  upon  than  the  sight 

Handle  me  (•faXatfeari),  that  by  touching  my  body  you  may  be 
assured  of  the  reality  of  its  existence.  Hence  it  is  clear,  says  S. 
Gregory,  that  a glorified  body  is  immaterial  (subtile)  by  reason  of  its 
spiritual  powers,  but  material  (palpabile)  inasmuch  as  it  is  true  to  its 
nature. 

You  will  ask,  firstly,  how  the  glorified  body  of  Christ  could  be  at 
one  and  the  same  time  material  and  inmaterial  ? 

I answer.  First,  because  glorified  bodies  possess  (1)  the  property 
of  permeability,  and  hence  are  able  not  only  to  offer  no  resistance 
to  another  body,  but  even  to  penetrate  it  And  they  possess  (2)  the 
power  of  eluding  the  touch,  as  they  have  the  power  of  vanish- 
ing from  the  sight,  according  to  what  I have  just  said.  These  pro- 
perties or  powers  they  use  or  not,  according  as  they  are  inclined. 

Consequently,  glorified  bodies  can  be  apprehended  by  the  touch 
or  not,  according  as  they  will 

You  will  ask,  secondly,  whether  this  handling  of  Christ,  His  sitting 
at  meat  with  the  disciples,  and  such  like,  are  sufficient  proofs  of  His 
resurrection  ? 

I answer  that  these  proofs  were  not  absolutely  and  physically 
certain,  for  the  angels,  when  they  appeared  in  bodily  form,  were 
touched  and  handled  by  Abraham,  Lot,  and  others ; but  they  are 
certain  in  a moral  sense,  and  as  far  as  human  certainty  permits.

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXIV. 


1.  Because  on  this  account,  Christ  willed  to  abide  long  with  the 
Apostles,  and  to  manifest  Himself  after  His  resurrection,  as  in  His 
death,  to  their  hearing,  sight,  and  touch,  senses  which  are  held  by 
men  to  be  most  trustworthy. 

2.  Because  it  pertained  to  the  providence  of  God  not  to  let  these 
so  great  signs  pass  unnoticed,  but  to  take  away  all  pretence  of 
deception.  For  the  truth  of  the  Messiah  and  the  new  religion  was 
at  stake,  specially  the  point  as  to  whether  He  really  had  risen 
from  the  dead. 

3.  Because  these  signs,  taken  in  conjunction  with  the  miracles  of 
Christ,  and  the  prophecies  of  His  coming,  made  it  both  credible  and 
certain,  that  He  had  indeed  risen  from  the  dead. 

Ver.  40. — And  when  He  had  thus  spoken^  He  shewed  them  His 
hatids  and  His  feet — "pierced,  and  still  bearing  the  prints  of  the 
nails,”  says  Euthymius ; as  is  clear  from  S.  John  xx.  27.  For  Christ 
willed  that  these  five  wounds,  or  rather  wound-prints,  should  remain 
in  His  glorified  body  as  trophies  of  His  victory  over  sin  and  death 
and  hell. 

“ He  bore  them  with  Him  to  heaven,”  says  S.  Ambrose,  “ in  order 
to  show  them  to  God  the  Father,  as  the  price  of  our  liberty.” 
For  “ He  who  destroyed  the  kingdom  of  death  would  not  efface 
the  signs  of  death.”  In  like  manner  also  the  martyrs  will  exhibit 
their  scars  in  heaven,  as  so  many  glorious  tokens  of  their  victory. 

For  they  will  be  to  them  not  a disfigurement  but  dignity,  and  in 
their  bodies  a certain  beauty  will  shine  forth,  a beauty  not  of  the 
body,  but  of  merit ; for  such  marks  as  these  must  not  be  accounted 
blemishes.  S.  Augustine  (De  Civit.  Lib.  xxiL  cap.  xx.) 

You  will  ask  whether  the  disciples  actually  handled  and  touched 
the  pierced  hands  and  feet  of  Christ  after  His  resurrection  ? 

I answer  that  this  is  a matter  of  uncertainty,  because  Scripture  is 
silent  on  the  subject  But  it  is  probable  that  some  both  handled 
and  touched  the  Lord,  especially  those  who  were  the  more  doubtful 
concerning  His  resurrection,  because  they,  on  their  part,  were 
anxious  to  satisfy  themselves,  by  actual  touch,  that  it  was  no  phantom, 
but  Christ  alive  from  the  dead — because  also  Christ  Himself  bade

them  “ handle  ” Him,  so  that  there  might  be  no  room  for  doubt,  but 
that  the  Apostles  might  be  able  to  preach  to  the  Gentiles  that  Christ 
had  indeed  risen  from  the  dead. 

So  we  read,  “ That  which  we  have  looked  upon,  and  our  hands 
have  handled  of  the  Word  of  Life  . . . declare  we  unto  you.” 
1 S.  John  i.  i. 

Ver.  41. — And  while  they  ye/  believed  not  for  joy,  and  wandered. 
On  the  one  hand,  because  they  had  handled  Him,  the  disciples 
believed  that  Jesus  had  risen,  and  taken  again  His  true  body;  but 
on  the  other  hand,  so  great  was  their  joy  and  their  wonder  at  the 
strangeness  of  the  event,  that  they  could  scarcely  believe  that  it  was 
the  very  Jesus  who  had  been  so  recently  crucified.  They  rejoiced 
greatly  because  they  believed,  but  the  greatness  of  their  joy  reacted 
on  their  faith.  So  it  is  a matter  of  common  experience  that  if  a 
trustworthy  person  brings  us  some  unexpected  good  news,  our  joy 
is  so  great  that  we  refuse  to  credit  it,  lest  if  it  prove  untrue,  and  we 
find  that  we  have  been  deceived,  we  sorrow  as  much  as  we  before 
rejoiced.  We  restrain  our  joy  until  we  are  sure  that  it  is  well 
founded.  So  was  it  with  the  Apostles : “ their  exceeding  great  joy,” 
says  Vatablus,  “obscured  their  judgment” 

Have  ye  here  any  meat t Christ  appeared  to  His  disciples  “as 
they  sat  at  meat”  (S.  Mark,  xvi.  13),  and  they,  when  they  saw  Him, 
out  of  reverence  rose  up  from  the  table  and  ran  to  meet  Him,  full 
of  joy  and  astonishment,  and  therefore  doubtingly.  Hence  Jesus 
suffered  them  to  handle  Him,  and  since  they  did  not  even  then  fully 
believe,  asked  for  meat,  in  order  that  He  might  eat  before  them,  and 
so  show  that  He  was  alive  again. 

Ver.  42. — And  they  gave  Him  a piece  of  a broiled  fish,  and  of  an 
honeycomb  A proof  of  the  frugality  of  the  Apostles,  for  if  they  had 
had  any  better  food  they  would  have  offered  it  to  their  Master. 
But  as  fishermen  they  fed  on  fish,  just  as  Athseneus  (De  Cosnis 
Sapientum)  tells  us  the  frugal  men  of  old  were  accustomed  to  do ; 
and  in  point  of  fact  up  to  the  time  of  the  deluge  flesh  was  not 
known  as  an  article  of  food.  (See  Gen.  ix.) 

Symbolically , says  Bede,  “ the  broiled  fish  signifies  the  sufferings  of

S.  LUKE,  C.  XXIV. 


Christ.  For  He,  having  condescended  to  lie  in  the  waters  of  the 
human  race,  was  willing  to  be  taken  by  the  hook  of  our  death,  and 
was  as  it  were  burnt  up  by  anguish  at  the  time  of  His  passion. 
But  the  honeycomb  was  present  to  us  at  the  resurrection;  the 
honey  in  the  wax  being  the  divine  nature  in  the  human ; ” and  again 
“ He  ate  part  of  a broiled  fish,  signifying  that  having  burnt  by  the 
fire  of  His  own  divinity  our  nature  swimming  in  the  sea  of  this  life, 
and  dried  up  the  moisture  which  it  had  contracted  from  the  waves, 
He  made  it  divine  food  of  sweet  savour  in  the  sight  of  God,  which 
the  honeycomb  signifies.  Or  we  may  take  the  broiled  fish  to  mean 
the  active  life  drying  up  the  moisture  by  the  coals  of  labour,  and 
the  honeycomb  is  the  sweet  contemplation  of  the  oracles  of  God.” 
Theophylact.  “ By  the  command  of  the  law  the  passover  was  eaten 
with  bitter  herbs,  but  after  the  resurrection  the  food  is  sweetened 
with  a honeycomb.”  Gregory  Nyssen. 

Tropologically , says  the  Gloss:  “ Those  who  endure  tribulation 
( assantur  tribulaiionibus)  for  the  sake  of  God,  will  hereafter  be 
satisfied  with  true  sweetness.” 

Another  reason  why  Christ  ate  the  broiled  fish  is  given  by  an 
anonymous  writer  in  the  Greek  Catena:  “The  word  of  God  as  a 
new  and  unapproachable  fire,  by  the  hypostatic  union,  dried  up 
the  moisture  in  which  human  nature  as  a fish — because  of 
its  incontinency — was  immersed,  and  set  it  free  by  mixture  of  His 
passion,  fulfilling  so  sweetly  this  dispensation  as  to  make  ready 
sweet  food  for  Himself;  for  the  salvation  of  men  is  the  food  of 
God.” 

Hence  Christ  soon  after  He  had  eaten,  breathed  on  the  Apostles, 
and  bestowed  on  them  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Ghost  for  the  remission 
of  sins.  S.  John  xx.  22. 

Ver.  43. — And  He  took  if,  and  did  eat  before  them . Christ  truly 
ate  of  the  food,  and  not  in  appearance  only,  after  the  manner  of  an 
angeL  “ I did  neither  eat  nor  drink,  but  ye  did  see  a vision.”  Tobit 
xil  19.  Tet  He  was  not  thereby  nourished.  So  Theophylact  says, 
“ He  ate  by  some  divine  power  consuming  what  He  was  eating.” 
Similarly,  S.  Augustine : “ The  thirsty  earth,  and  the  burning  rays  of

the  sun  absorb  water,  each  in  a different  way ; the  one  because  of  its 
need ; the  other  by  its  power.”  So  D.  Thomas  and  the  Schoolmen. 

The  Vulgate  adds,  “sumens  rdiquias , dedit  eis  ; ” but  these  words, 
although  in  the  Arabic,  are  absent  from  the  Greek  and  from  the 
Syriac  versions. 

Ver.  44. — And  He  said  unto  them.  These  are  the  words  which  1 
spake  unto  you , while  I was  yet  with  you,  &c.,  Le.  that  I was  to 
suffer  death  upon  the  Cross  and  rise  again  the  third  day.  Acknow- 
ledge Me  then  as  the  true  Messiah,  inasmuch  as  My  words  have 
been  verified  to  the  letter.  Or  by  a metonomy  these  are  the  words, 
i.e.  the  things  which  I spake  to  you,  My  passion,  death,  and  resur- 
rection, which  ye  see  accomplished.  These  things  therefore  ought 
not  to  appear  to  you  strange  and  unexpected,  for  they  were  predicted, 
not  only  by  me,  but  in  time  past  by  Moses,  and  the  prophets,  and 
by  David  in  the  Psalms  concerning  Me. 

Some  think  that  S.  Luke  wrote  these  words  by  anticipation,  and 
that  Christ  spake  them  not  on  the  day  of  His  resurrection  but  on 
that  of  His  ascension.  For  it  was  then  that  He  bade  the  disciples 
remain  in  Jerusalem  (Acts  i.  4),  as  Luke  records,  verse  49,  going 
on  in  the  verses  following  to  describe  the  ascension.  But  perhaps 
the  words  were  used  on  both  occasions,  the  oftener  to  impress  them 
upon  the  Apostles  for  the  greater  confirmation  of  their  faith. 

Ver.  45. — Then  opened  He  their  understanding  that  they  might  under- 
stand  the  scriptures.  He  expounded  unto  them  in  all  the  Scriptures 
the  things  concerning  Himself,  as  He  had  done  before  at  Emmaus. 
See  ver.  27. 

Christ  did  this  both  to  confirm  the  Apostles  in  their  belief  and  to 
prepare  them  to  teach  and  to  preach  the  faith.  For  it  was  part  of  the 
apostolic  office  to  expound  the  Scriptures*  Hence  what  He  here 
began,  Christ  perfected  at  Pentecost,  by  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Ghost 

Hence  it  is  clear : 

1.  That  Holy  Scripture  is  not,  as  heretics  say,  easy  of  inter- 
pretation to  all. 

2.  That  it  is  not  to  be  interpreted,  as  they  contend,  according  to 
the  letter,  but  according  to  the  teaching  of  that  Holy  Spirit,  which

Christ  bestowed  upon  His  Apostles,  which  the  Apostles  delivered 
to  the  Church,  and  the  Church  has  handed  down  to  us.  Hence  S. 
Paul,  i Cor.  xii.,  tells  us  that  God  hath  set  teachers  in  the  Church, 
and  among  the  diversities  of  gifts  numbers  “the  interpretation  of 
tongues.11  And  so  in  former  times  the  Church  had  her  interpreters, 
whose  special  duties  are  described  by  Baronins,  voL  L pi  394. 

Ver.  46. — And  said  unto  them , Thus  it  is  written  (Isa.  liii.,  Ps. 
xxil  et  alib.)  and  thus  it  behoved  Christ  to  suffer, , &c.  See  how  by 
these  articles  of  faith  Christ  opened  the  understanding  of  the  Apostles, 
to  the  acknowledging  the  Scriptures,  which  foretold  these  events. 

Ver.  47. — And  that  repentance  and  remission  of  sins  should  be 
preached  in  His  name%  Le. — 1.  By  His  authority.  2.  At  His  com- 
mand. 3.  In  His  stead.  That  the  Apostles  should  continue  the 
teaching  of  Christ,  and  spread  the  doctrine  of  repentance  and 
remission  of  sins  throughout  the  world.  4.  In  His  name,  ie.,  in 
virtue  of  His  meritorious  death  upon  the  cross,  whereby  alone  God 
gives  the  spirit  of  repentance  and  remission  of  sin. 

Beginning  at  Jerusalem.  A command  to  the  Apostles  to  commence 
their  preaching  at  Jerusalem,  and  from  thence  to  go  unto  all  nations. 
u Beginning  ” (c^ct^iw,  incipientibus,  Vulgate).  The  Apostles  were 
to  begin  their  preaching  at  Jerusalem : 1.  Because  there  the  Syna- 
gogue was  flourishing,  and  there  the  Church  had  its  origin,  for  the 
old  Jewish  dispensation  was  transformed  into  the  Christian  Church 
by  the  preaching  of  Christ,  according  to  the  words  of  the  prophet : 
“ Out  of  Zion  shall  go  forth  the  law,  and  the  word  of  the  Lord  from 
Jerusalem.”  Isaiah  ii.  3.  And  again,  “ Arise,  shine ; for  thy  light  has 
come.’1  Ibid.  lx.  (Vulgate).  2.  Because  Christ,  with  all  the  bless-

Solomon  had  reigned  there,  and  Christ,  the  son  of  David,  had  come 
to  restore  their  kingdom,  but  in  a higher  and  a spiritual  sense  (see 
Acts  L 4).

JESUS’  ASCENSION  AND  PARTING  BLESSING. 


527 


i.e.  after  a few  days,  when  the  Feast  of  Pentecost  is  come,  I will  send 
you  the  Holy  Spirit,  who  will  teach  you  clearly  many  things  beside 
these,  and  enable  you  to  preach  the  gospel  to  all  nations. 

But  tarry  ye  in  the  city  of  Jerusalem  until  ye  be  endued  with  power 
from  on  high . dwd/Atv,  i.e.,  with  the  gifts  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  for  waa 
a general  does  not  permit  his  soldiers  who  are  about  to  meet  a large 
number,  to  go  out  until  they  are  armed,  so  also  the  Lord  did  not 
permit  His  disciples  to  go  forth  to  the  conflict  before  the  descent 
of  the  Spirit”  S.  Chrysostom  in  Catena. 

Tropologically , S.  Gregory  (Past  iii.  26)  says,  “ We  abide  in  a city 
when  we  keep  ourselves  close  within  the  gates  of  our  minds,  lest  by 
speaking  we  wander  beyond  them ; that  when  we  are  perfectly 
endued  with  divine  power  we  may  then  as  it  were  go  out  beyond 
ourselves  to  instruct  others.” 

Ver.  50. — And  He  led  them  out  as  far  as  to  Bethany , and  from 
thence  to  the  mount  of  Olives.  Bethany  was  about  fifteen  furlongs 
[stadia]  from  Jerusalem,  and  close  by  the  mount  of  Olives.  Christ 
went  to  Bethany  to  say  farewell  to  Lazarus  and  his  sister,  and  to 
bring  them  with  Him  to  mount  Olivet,  in  order  that  they  might 
witness  His  ascension,  and  share  in  His  triumph. 

And  He  lifted  up  His  hands  towards  heaven,  as  if  seeking  a 
special  blessing  for  His  disciples. 

And  blessed  them , signing  them  with  the  sign  of  the  Cross,  as 
Dionysius  the  Carthusian  and  others  think.  Indeed,  S.  Jerome, 
commenting  on  the  words,  “ I will  set  a sign  among  them,” 
Isa.  lxvi  19,  says,  Our  ascending  Lord  left  us  this  sign,  or  rather 
placed  it  on  our  foreheads,  so  that  we  may  freely  say,  “ The  light  of 
Thy  countenance  is  lifted  up  upon  us,  O Lord.”  For  the  Cross  is 
the  sign  of  Christ,  which  is  the  fountain  of  all  benediction  and 
grace.  Hence  the  tradition  which  has  come  down  from  the  time  of 
Christ  and  the  Apostles  that  in  giving  a blessing  the  hands  should 
always  form  the  sign  of  the  Cross. 

Therefore,  says  Theophylact,  we  should  learn  when  about  to  leave 
our  dependents  or  friends,  to  give  them  our  blessing,  and,  signing  them 
with  the  sign  of  the  Cross,  commit  them  to  the  keeping  of  God.

S.  LUKE,  c.  XXIV. 


Ver.  52. — And  they  worshipped  Him,  and  returned  to  Jerusalem 
with  great  joy.  They  rejoiced  greatly  because  they  had  seen  their 
Master  triumphantly  ascend  into  heaven,  because  they  eagerly  and 
without  doubting  looked  for  the  promised  gift  of  the  Comforter,  and 
because  they  had  good  hope  that  Christ  would,  in  like  manner,  after 
they  had  laboured  in  the  gospel  cause,  receive  them  to  Himself 
according  to  His  gracious  promise.  S.  John. 

Ver.  53. — And  were  continually  in  the  temple , praising  and  blessing 
God.  Amen.  “ Continually.”  We  may  either  take  this  word  to  refer 
to  the  time  of  the  descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  for  before  His  coming 
they  remained  at  home  for  fear  of  the  Jews,  or  we  may  take  it 
absolutely,  for  the  upper  room  in  which  they  dwelt  was  near  the 
temple,  so  that  they  could  easily  go  to  and  fra  Acts  L 13. 

In  midst  of  prayers  and  praises,  with  eager  preparation  of  heart, 
they  waited  for  the  promise  of  the  Spirit,  says  Bede,  who  also 
observes  “that  S.  Luke,  who  commenced  his  Gospel  with  the 
ministry  of  Zacharias,  the  priest  in  the  temple,  very  fitly  concludes 
it  with  the  devotion  of  the  Apostles  in  the  same  holy  place.  For  he 
has  placed  them  there,  about  to  be  the  ministers  of  a new  priest- 
hood, not  in  the  blood  of  sacrifices,  but  in  the  praises  of  God,  and 
in  blessing.” 

Morally , the  Apostles  and  the  disciples  teach  us  by  their  example 
to  make  the  Christian  life  a perpetual  round  of  praise  to  God 
and  Christ  For  thus  we  enter  upon  the  life  of  the  blessed,  to 
whom  the  ceaseless  praise  of  God  is,  as  I have  often  shown,  for 
everlasting  their  labour  and  their  rest  “ Blessed  are  they  that 
dwell  in  Thy  house  : they  will  be  alway  praising  Thee.”
