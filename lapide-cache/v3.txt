THE 


HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, 

ACCORDING TO S. MATTHEW, 


CHAPTER XXII. 

9 The marriage of the king's son. n The wedding garment. 15 Of paying 
tribute . 23 Of the resurrection. 

AND Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 

2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a 
marriage for his son, 

3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding 1 
and they would not come. 

4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden. 
Behold, I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fadings are killed, and all 
things are ready : come unto the marriage. 

5 But they made light of it , and went their ways, one to his farm, and another 
to his merchandise : 

6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew 
them. 

7 But when the king heard thereof he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies, 
and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 

8 Then saith he to his servants. The wedding is ready, but they which were 
bidden were not worthy. 

9 Go ye, therefore, into the highways ; and as many as ye shall find, bid to 
the marriage. 

10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all, 
as many as they found, both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with 
guests. 

1 1 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which 
had not on a wedding garment : 

12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in hither, not having a 
wedding garment ? And he was speechless. 

13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him

away, and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth. 

14 For many are called, but few are chosen. 

15 IT Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him 
in his talk. 

16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying. 
Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither 
carest thou for any man ; for thou regardest not the person of men. 

17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto 
Caesar, or not ? 

18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said. Why tempt ye me, yt 
hypocrites ? 

19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 

20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription ? 

21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore 
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. 

22 When they had heard these words , they marvelled, and left him, and went 
their way. 

23 IT The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no 
resurrection, and asked him, 

24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother 
shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 

25 Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first, when he had married 
a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother. 

26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 

27 And last of all the woman died also. 

28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for 
they all had her. 

29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, 
nor the power of God. 

30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but 
are as the angels of God in heaven. 

31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which 
was spoken unto you by God, saying, 

32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 
God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 

33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. 

34 IT But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to 
silence, they were gathered together. 

35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question , tempting 
him, and saying, 

36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law ? 

37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 

38 This is the first and great commandment. 

39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, 

40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. 

41 5 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

THE WEDDING FEAST. 3 

4 2 Saying, What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him, 
The son of David. 

43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord ? saying, 

44 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine 
enemies thy footstool. 

45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son ? 

46 And no man was able to answer him a word ; neither durst any man from 
that day forth ask him any more questions. 

And Jesus answered \ &c., refuting the incredulity of the Scribes. 
The meaning is : it is the same in the kingdom of Heaven, i,e, 9 in 
the Church militant here on earth, as if a king made a marriage for 
his son, &c. For in other respects the kingdom of Heaven is not 
directly and precisely like a king, but a kingdom. S. Gregory treats 
of this parable at length {Horn. 38, in Evang.). 

The parable is similar to that which Luke records (xiv. 16). 
Maldonatus thinks it is the same with that, and that Matthew has 
not here observed the historical order. With more reason S. Augus- 
tine (/. 2, de consens. Evang, c, 71), S. Thomas, Jansen, and others 
think that this is a different parable from that in Luke ; or if the same, 
that they were uttered upon two occasions, and in different words. 
It is clear on comparison that they have numerous differences. 
For, not to speak of other things, Luke says that the parable was 
spoken in the house of a Pharisee. Matthew here asserts that 
it was spoken publicly in the temple. This is plain from ver. 23. 
Again, Luke calls this marriage feast a supper; Matthew, a dinner. 

And sent his servants , &c. For marriage , the Syriac version has 
throughout feast, meaning marriage feast. 

The whole parable may be expounded and applied as follows : — 
1st The king is God the Father ; the son of the king, the bridegroom^ 
is God’s Incarnate Son, Jesus Christ, whose spouse is the Church, 
whose nuptials were begun in the Incarnation of Christ, for in it 
Christ espoused human nature to Himself, hypostatically, and the 
Church, that is, all faithful people, mystically, to be His Spouse 
by grace. But in Heaven these nuptials shall be consummated 
with glory. So Origen, SS. Hilary, Jerome, Gregory, and others. 
Wherefore, tropologically, “by marriage , understand,” says Origen, 
“the union of Christ with the soul ; and by offspring, good works.”

S. MATTHEW, C. XXII. 


ad. God the Father made a marriage feast for Christ, since in 
Judea, and in the whole world, He hath, through Christ, spread a 
table of evangelical doctrine and sacraments, especially the Sacra- 
ment of the Eucharist 

3<L To this nuptial feast the Jews were invited by God, through 
Moses and the prophets, as the servants of God, both before and 
after the incarnation of Christ, that they might believe first that 
it was about to take place, and then that it had taken place ; that 
so, believing in Christ, repenting and seeking grace from Him, 
they might obtain justice and salvation. 

4th. Bulls and fadings have only the general signification of rich 
provision for a banquet. They denote the grandeur of the doctrines 
of the Gospel, says S. Jerome, and of the Sacraments. 

Moreover, fallings {alt ilia, Vulg.) do not mean winged creatures, 
birds and fowls, but bulls and calves, and other creatures which 
are fed up. Altilia is derived from alo 9 to nourish. The Greek is 
cmerd, fallings. Wherefore the Arabic translates, and my calves 
are now fed , and have been killed, Gr. r«%4i*a, i.e, have been 
immolated. For in olden time, as now, weddings were wont to be 
inaugurated by a sacrifice, and marriage feasts were kept with 
victims slain and offered in sacrifice. So also the marriage feast 
of Christ, which is here parabolically described, took its beginning 
from the sacrifice of the Cross. Symbolically, by bulls (Vulg.) 
S. Gregory understands the Fathers of the Old Covenant, who, by 
the permission of the Law, smote their enemies with the horn of 
corporeal strength. But the failings , saith he, are the Fathers of 
the New Testament, raised by contemplation from the things of 
earth to things above. But Chrysostom says, “ failings are 
Prophets; bulls, those who were both Prophets and Priests.” As 
bulls are leaders of the herd, so are Priests the princes of the 
people. S. Hilary says, the bulls are martyrs, who, like victims, 
have been immolated. The fallings are spiritual persons, filled as 
it were with spiritual bread. Lastly, Origen says, the dinner is the 
word of God. Bulls signify the strong meat of the word ; failing s 
its sweeter portions.

THE SPIRITUAL BANQUET. 


5 


5th. The field, the farm, whither those who were invited went away, 
despising the invitation, signify temporal good things, which drew 
away the Jews from the faith of Christ, and from heavenly good things ; 
and which led them to slay the servants of God, yea, even Christ 
Himself Wherefore, God sent Titus, who slew the Jews as being 
murderers , and burnt up their city , namely, their capital, Jerusalem. 

Christ in this parable has an allusion to Isa. xxv. 6, “And in 
this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a 
feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things 
full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined;” and Isa. 
xxx. 23, 24, “Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that 
thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of 
the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall 
thy cattle feed in large pastures. The oxen likewise and the 
young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which 
hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.” 

Learn from hence that Christ always sets before us in the 
Church a rich spiritual banquet of holy doctrine and grace, 
abundantly seasoned with sacred lections, sermons, exhortations, 
and with innumerable examples in every kind of virtue, of Apostles, 
Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, with frequent receiving of the Sacra- 
ments, especially the Eucharist, which is “the corn of the elect, 
and the wine that maketh virgins,” as Zechariah saith (ix. 17) ; with 
the Sacrifice of the Mass, with such great adornment of the sacred 
ministers, altars, and temples, and with the heavenly harmony of 
music and organs, and many other things which feed, delight, 
inebriate the souls of the faithful, so that Christianity is to the 
pious one continual banquet, according to the words in Isa. 
lxvL 23, “The feast of the new moon shall be from one month 
to another, and from sabbath to sabbath.” 

Lastly, Christ Himself, Incarnate, is the perennial food and joy 
of the faithful. For He, through the Incarnation, really communi- 
cates to them not only all the gifts of His grace, but Himself, in 
all His fulness, and therefore His very Deity itself. And this He 
gives them to taste, to eat, to enjoy, as it is said in S. John vL 51,

S. MATTHEW, c. XXtt. 


<4 1 am the Living Bread, who came down from heaven. Whoso- 
ever shall eat of this Bread, shall live eternally.” This is the 
reason why Isaiah, when declaring beforehand the delights and 
happiness which were to come to the new Church from Christ 
Incarnate, everywhere rejoices and exults, and invites all Christians 
evermore to rejoice and exult with him. See chaps, ii. vil ; chaps, 
xxx., xxxv., lx., lxi., lxil, &c Let Christians therefore, and espe- 
cially Priests and Religions, take care to feed in these feasts in 
their souls; and serve Christ in righteousness and holiness, that 
thus they may begin that life of beatitude with Him now, which 
by and by will be perfected and consummated in Heaven. 

Ver. 8 . Then saith he, &c. This is the second part of the 
parable of the guests. Then, that is to say, when these who were 
invited, meaning the Jews, refused to come to the nuptial table of 
the evangelical doctrine of Christ, because they were not worthy of 
it, because they despised it — then saith the King, that is God, to 
His servants, the Apostles — 

Go ye into the highways ; Vulg. the ends of the ways; Gr. &*££- 
6ovs o 3Sp, the passages , the outlets of the ways. The meaning is, 
Traverse and run through all the ways, and the turnings, and corners, 
and bendings of the roads. Let there be no nook which you do not 
traverse. Do ye, O ye Apostles, travel over the whole world ; go 
into all the countries of the nations, that ye may preach the faith 
of Christ to them, and invite all men to it. He also bids the 
Apostles to transfer the Gospel from the invited guests, that is the 
Jews, to all nations. Wherefore He adds — 

And his servants went out , &c. The Apostles were to go and 
preach the Gospel in all nations unto the ends of the earth, 
according to the words in Ps. xix., “ Their sound is gone out into 
all lands, and their words unto the end of the world.” Mystically : 
the servants are angels who preside over the conversion of the 
Gentiles, says Origen. 

Symbolically: the highways are the various and contradictory 
errors and sects of the Gentiles, which the Apostles destroyed. 
So Remigius. ad. S. Chrysostom says, The ways are the various

THE WEDDING GARMENT.

professions of men in the world, as the profession of philosophy, 
arms, &c. Christ therefore bids that men of every profession 
shall be invited to believe. 3d. S. Hilary says, " The way is the 
time of the world. They are bidden to go out to the end, because 
the past is forgiven to all." 4th. S. Gregory says, The ways are 
actions : their terminations ( exitus ) are defects. 

They gathered together all \ &c. This is an ornament (emblema) 
of the parable, and only signifies that all men, without any dis- 
tinction whatsoever, are invited to the faith of Christ 

And the weddings &c. The Church has been filled with a 
copious multitude of ail nations. 

When the king came in , &c, that he might survey and examine 
them. This shall take place when God shall come to the general 
judgment at the end of the world, to judge, and reward or punish 
all mankind. So Origen, &c. 

And he saw . . . wedding garment ; Syr. a. festal garment The 
garment for the wedding , that is, one which is clean, precious, 
and splendid, is not faith, as the heretics say. For all who were 
at this feast of the Church, indeed, could not have entered in 
except by faith. Therefore this garment is charity, and holiness 
of life. A pure and holy life is like a clean and splendid robe, 
woven of virtues and good works, which are a glorious adornment 
of a man. So SS. Jerome, Hilary, Tertullian, and others. S. 
Gregory explains the not having a wedding garment to mean faith 
without works of charity, by which the Lord comes to unite the 
Church in marriage with Himself. But S. Augustine (lib. 2, contra 
Faust c. 19) explains it to mean one who seeks his own, not the 
Lord’s glory. But S. Hilary says, the wedding garment is the grace 
of the Holy Spirit, and the brightness of heavenly conversation, 
which being received by the good answer of confession, is pre- 
served spotless for the celestial company. S. Jerome says, works 
which are fulfilled out of the Law and the Gospel, form the garment 
of the new man. 

Many in the day of judgment who believed in Christ shall 
be found without this robe of charity and sanctity; yet one only

is mentioned, because this matter is spoken of, as it were, by 
the way. For the direct object of Christ in this parable was to de- 
clare that when the unbelieving Jews were rejected, the Gentiles 
were called to Christ This one, however, denotes all who are 
like Him. It also signifies that not even one wicked person can lie 
hid in the day of judgment, or go away unpunished. 

And said to him , Friend (Syr. my comrade ), &c. The word 
friend signifies that God will speak thus to the wicked, not out of 
hatred, or a desire to condemn them, but in a friendly manner, 
from zeal of justice S. Jerome adds, he calls him friend \ because 
he was invited to the wedding feast Therefore he rebukes him 
for his impudence, because he came in a rude manner without 
a wedding garment Whence S. Gregory says, “It is marvellous 
how he calls him friend , and yet rejects him.” It is as though 
he said plainly, “Friend, and not friend; friend by faith , but not 
friend by works . ” 

But he was speechless. For, says S. Jerome, that was no place 
of denial; for God shall there “bring to light the hidden things 
of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the heart,” 
according to the words, “I will search Jerusalem with candles” 
(Zeph. i. i a). 

Then said the king — to his servants , his angels, as is plain from 
Matt xiii. 39. And as Daniel saith concerning them, “Thousand 
thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten 
thousand stood before Him. 11 

Bind him 9 &c. This is an emblem, signifying that the damned 
cannot resist the sentence of God, nor from thenceforth do any 
good thing; altogether as if they had their hands and feet, their 
mouth and souls, their will and judgment bound. For as S. 
Augustine says (lib. n, de Trin.\ “The binding of an evil will is 
a chain.” And S. Gregory says, “ They who now are willingly in 
bonds to sin, shall then, against their will, be bound in punish- 
ment” 

Cast him . . . teeth. These are the teeth which delighted in 
gluttony, says S. Gregory. And again the same S. Gregory says

MANY CALLED: FEW CHOSEN. 9 

appositely, 44 The inner darkness is the darkness of the heart ; the 
outer darkness is the night of eternal damnation.’ 1 

Many are called, \ &c. Because all who were first invited and 
refused to come were rejected, that is to say, all the Jews, who 
would not believe in Christ, to whom this parable bears special 
reference. Besides these, one was rejected, even of those who 
were called, and did come, who entered in, not having a wedding 
garment, who represents all wicked Christians. For inasmuch as 
Christ did not intend in this place specially to refer to these, 
it sufficed that by naming one, He should refer to that matter by 
the way, to signify that not all who believe in Christ shall be saved, 
but those only who adorn their faith with a wedding garment, that 
is, with love and holy works. This saying of Christ ought to raise 
great fear and awe For no one knoweth whether he be elect 
or reprobate Every one therefore ought to strive, by means of 
good works, to make his calling and election sure 

S. Gregory gives the example of his three paternal aunts. The 
first of these was named Tharsilla. She lived in holy virginity, and 
was called away to Heaven by her grandfather, who was already 
among the blessed, in these words, 14 Come, that I may receive thee 
into this mansion of light” Then she, looking up, beheld Jesus, 
and cried aloud, “Depart ye, depart ye, Jesus cometh,” and so 
delivered up her soul to Him to be eternally blessed. The second 
sister, Emiliana, was called away to Heaven by Tharsilla herself 
on the Feast of the Epiphany; and being anxious about her third 
sister Gordiana, she answered, “And if I come alone, to whom 
shall I leave Gordiana?” Again she heard her sister’s voice say- 
ing, “Come, for Gordiana hath chosen her lot with the world.” 

For, shortly afterwards, Gordiana, forgetful of her consecration to 

♦ 

virginity, married her bailiff. 

Ver. 15. Then went the Pharisees . . . entangle, &c. For entangle, 
the Greek has vayidiveueii, Le., ensnare; for *ayid 1; are snares . 
And so the Syriac has prepare gins like bird-catchers. The Pharisees 
put captious questions to Christ with the design that whatever way 
He might answer, He should incur blame ; and that so they might,

as it were, entrap Him in His answer, and that He might be open 
to the charge of treason against either human or Divine Majesty. 
“They laid a plot by means of a dilemma,” says S. Augustine 
(/. i, contra Crescen . c. 17), that whichever He should choose of 
its two horns, He might be caught If He answered that it was 
lawful, He would be a traitor to the people of God ; but if He 
said it was not lawful, He would be punished as an enemy to 
Caesar. 

With the Herodians ; Syr. with those who were of the house of 
Herod. 

The Herodians were a Jewish sect, who favoured the Roman 
Caesar, and the payment of tribute to him. They were named 
from the first Herod of Ascalon, the infanticide, who was entirely 
devoted to Caesar, inasmuch as he had been made king of Judea by 
Augustus Caesar and the Roman Senate So S. Jerome, Origen, 
and others. S. Epiphanius (lib. 1, hceres. 20) andS. Jerome (Dialogo 
cont. Luciferanos ) add that these Herodians were Jewish sectaries, 
or heretics, who held that Herod of Ascalon was the Messiah or 
Christ promised by the prophets, because they saw that in him the 
sceptre had failed from Judah. Herod eagerly encouraged these 
flatterers. And the reason why he slew the infants at Bethlehem 
was that he might kill Christ, that no one but himself might be 
accounted Christ. For the same reason, he built a most magnifi- 
cent temple for the Jews, vieing with that of Solomon, as Josephus 
shows (Lib. Ant. 15, c. 14). Listen to S. Jerome briefly enume- 
rating the Jewish sects, “ I say nothing about the Jewish heretics, 
who, before the coming of Christ, made light of the law delivered 
to them. There was Dositheus, prince of the Samaritans, who 
rejected the prophets. There were the Sadducees, sprung from his 
root, who went on to deny the resurrection of the flesh. There were 
the Pharisees, divided from the rest of the Jews on account of 
certain superfluous observances. There were the Herodians, who 
took Herod for their king instead of Christ” Theophylact, 
Euthymius, and Philastrius say the same, with the exception, that 
for Herod of Ascalon, they substituted his son, Herod Antipas, who

put John the Baptist to death. But they are mistaken in their asser- 
tion that Herod Antipas was ever regarded by the Jews as Messiah. 

The Pharisees, therefore, who took the opposite side, namely, that 
Herod was not the Messiah, and that tribute ought not to be paid 
to the Roman Caesar, who put themselves forward as vindicators of 
the law of Moses and of Jewish liberty, suborned these Herodians 
to go together with their own disciples to Jesus, as to a prophet 
and teacher, and proposed this question to Him concerning giving 
tribute to Caesar. This they did with the crafty design that if Christ 
should assert that tribute ought to be given to Caesar, He would 
incur the hostility of the Jewish populace ; if, on the other hand, 
He should say that it was not to be paid, He might fall under the 
anger of Caesar and the Romans, who would condemn Him to 
death as being guilty of sedition. 

Master; Heb. Rabbi. Rabbi means not only a doctor of the 
law, such as are the Rabbins, but a potentate and a prince, endowed 
with authority. 

We know . . . the way of God, Le., the law of God. For the law 
is the way by which we go to God, and to His grace and glory. 
For the law teaches what is pleasing to God, what He wills us to 
do, that we may be justified and blessed by Him. 

And carest not, &c. Thou fearest neither the anger of Herod 
nor the power of Caesar, so as to be afraid to give a true answer, 
and deliver your opinion in behalf of your countrymen, even though 
you should expose yourself to the hostility of Herod and Caesar; 
even as John the Baptist, when he rebuked Herod’s adultery, did 
not shrink from incurring his anger. For they trusted that Christ 
would pronounce in favour of the Jews, as being faithful against 
Caesar, an unbeliever. So S. Chrysostom, “By means of flattery 
they hope to urge Him on to boldness, that He might say some- 
thing against the existing institutions, and the existing state of 
things;” “that He might come into collision with Caesar on a 
charge of rebellion.” 

For Thou regardest not the person; Syr. the face, &c. To look 
whether it be the face of a rich man and a prince, or a poor man

and a plebeian, so that Thou shouldest flatter and defend a prince, 
and condemn a poor man. Rather wilt Thou, as it were, shut 
Thine eyes, and give sentence in favour of truth and justice, and 
say, Caesar is My friend, but truth is a greater friend.” The Gr. 
wgoeuxo* signifies both person and face. 

Tell us therefore . . . tribute ; Syr. capitation-tax, because each 
head or each person was assessed. The Jews, as God’s faithful 
people, held aloof from the Gentiles, as idolaters. And many of 
them thought that it was not lawful for them to acknowledge Caesar 
as their lord, and pay him tribute; because God alone was their 
Master, to whom they paid tithes and tribute. By Caesar, Tiberius 
Caesar, the successor of Augustus, is meant 

The occasion of this question being propounded to Christ, was 
as follows. About this time one Judas, of Galilee, had taught that 
it was not lawful for the Jews to be in subjection to the Romans, 
and pay them taxes. Now Christ and the Apostles were regarded as 
Galilaeans; and the Jews professed to look upon them as upholders 
of this teaching of Judas the Galilaean, as being their countryman. 
And for this reason they frequently repudiated this error of theirs. 
Hear S. Jerome (i> i cap . 3, ad Tit. ver. 1), 41 1 think,” says he, “this 
precept was given by the Apostle, because at that time the teaching 
of Judas the Galilaean was still in vogue, and had many followers. 
Among their other tenets, they held it probable that, according to 
the law, no one ought to be called lord, except God only ; and that 
those who paid tithes to the Temple ought not to render tribute to 
Caesar. This sect increased to so great an extent as to influence a 
great part of the Pharisees as well as the rest of the people, so that 
they referred this question about the lawfulness of paying tribute to 
Caesar to our Lord, who answered prudently and cautiously, Render, 
&c. S. Paul’s teaching is in agreement with this answer, in that he 
bids believers be in subjection to princes and powers.” 

When Jesus knew, &c. It is as though He said, “You pretend 
to be friends, and to desire to maintain a good conscience, that 
you may know what you ought to do in this case truly and justly, 
according to the law of God, when all the while you are My enemies,

and are thirsting for My blood” “The prime virtue,” says S. 
Jerome, “in one who gives an answer is to know the mind of him 
who asks the question.” 

Ver. 19. Show Me the coin of the census . That is, Show me the 
coin which Caesar exacts as a tax from each person. The Arabic 
has, Show Me the figure of the denarius . And they brought unto 
Him a denarius . You will say that, according to chap. xviL 17, it 
appears that the Jews paid a capitation-tax of a didrachma, or a 
half shekel. But the Roman denarius was only worth about half a 
didrachma , or ninepence. My answer is, that the didrachma was, 
for the sake of convenience, divided into two denarii , and that each 
individual paid two denarii \ or one didrachma . So Jansen and 
Maldonatus. Lastly, it would appear that Tiberius and the other 
emperors ordered a denarius of this value to be struck off, which 
coin they required to be paid by the Jews in the way of tribute. As 
Baronius shows from Lampridius, the Romans were in the habit of 
striking off coins of such weight and value as they required to be 
paid in the way of tribute, and of greater or less value, according to 
the necessity of times and requirements. 

And fesus saith . . . superscription ; Gr. ; for which the 

Vulg. in Mark has inscription . For coins are wont to be stamped 
with the name and image of the prince who coins them. Hence 
the Arab, has, Whose figure and inscription is this t 

They say unto Him , Ccesads, i.e., Tiberius Caesar’s, who then 
reigned. Christ already knew this, but He put the question that 
He might draw from their own mouth a reply which He could turn 
against them and convict them. The cognomen Caesar was first 
given to Julius Caesar, from whom it passed to the succeeding 
emperors. Servius and Spartianus, and from them Charles Sigonius 
(lib. de Nomin . Horn.), say that Caesar was called originally from 
the slaughter of an elephant For Caesar signifies elephant in the 
Punic tongue. I have seen on some silver coins, on one side an 
elephant, with the inscription Caesar; on the reverse, instruments 
by means of which the Romans were wont to slay elephants. 

Then saith He, &c. As though He said, “ Since ye, O ye Jews,

are now subject to Caesar, and use his coins, do ye not so much give 
as render or restore (reddite) to him the denarius which is due to him 
as tribute. But spiritual things, that is to say, worship and piety, 
give ye (date) to God For this God exacts as what is rightly His 
due. So shall it come to pass that ye will offend neither against 
God nor Caesar.” 

Observe : that Christ is here unwilling to enter into the question 
whether the Jews were justly or unjustly subjects and tributaries of 
the Romans. For this was a doubtful question. For prima facie % 
the negative, that they were not justly subject, would seem the more 
correct For Pompey, who first reduced the Jews under the Roman 
yoke, was only called in by Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, the grandsons 
of Simon the high priest, to decide between them which of the two 
was to succeed to the Jewish sovereignty and high-priesthood. By 
what right then did Pompey pass them over, and transfer the sove- 
reign power over Judea to the Romans ? For this is Turkish justice. 
For when the Turk is called in to aid them by Christian princes 
quarrelling between themselves, he seizes upon and enslaves both. 
And yet, if we examine what happened more carefully, we shall 
perceive that the contrary proposition is the more probable, namely, 
that Pompey seized upon Judea by the right of a just war. For 
when Pompey had justly decided in favour of Hyrcanus, as being 
the elder, his younger brother, Aristobulus, atacked Jerusalem, and 
filled it with his soldiers, who fought against both Pompey and 
Hyrcanus. Then Pompey took Jerusalem by storm, and made it 
subject, with the consent of Hyrcanus, to the Roman yoke. Hyr- 
canus being unable to keep it by himself delivered it to Pompey, 
with the consent of the elders and nobles of the Jews, who pre- 
ferred to be subject to the Romans rather than to Hyrcanus and 
Aristobulus. For they saw that without the Romans, the Jewish 
state would be annihilated by schisms and seditions. See the rela- 
tion in Josephus (lib, 24, c, 5, &c.). 

Lastly, prescription was on the side of the Romans, for they had 
been in peaceful possession of Judea for about a hundred years, 
with at least the tacit assent of the Jewish people. And without

doubt the position of the possessor is the stronger. Wherefore, if 
the Pharisees wished to deprive the Romans of this possession, the 
onus probandi lay upon them of showing that they had acquired it 
unjustly. Since they were not able to do this, the Romans rightly 
retained possession. For when the accuser does not prove his 
charge, the accused is absolved. In this case the accusers were 
the Pharisees, the accused the Romans, whom the accusers wished 
to deprive of their possession. Christ therefore, in this place, does 
not choose to enter into the question whether the Roman dominion 
over Judea, and their imposition of tribute, was just or unjust : but 
He takes for granted that, as a matter of fact, that which was 
strengthened and confirmed by the various titles specified above 
was just For the Pharisees, in propounding this question about 
the payment of tribute to the Romans, did not put forward the plea 
of justice , but of religion and piety ; that is to say, that it was neither 
lawful nor becoming that they, who were the alone people of God, 
should pay tribute to Caesar, a Gentile and a heathen. They do 
not ask, “Are we bound to pay tribute to Caesar?” but, “ Is it law- 
ful to pay tribute to Caesar?” And they imply that to do so was 
contempt of God, a disgrace to the Jews, and an injury to their reli- 
gion. Christ answers, on the contrary, that it was not an injury to 
God and the faith, nor an indignity to a faithful nation, if the people 
of God were subject to Caesar, a Gentile ; and that the Jews them- 
selves might both profitably and honourably obey both God and a 
Gentile prince, if they would but render to both their due ; and if 
they would do this with prudence, so as to arouse against them 
neither God nor Caesar, and so destroy their whole nation, as they 
did not long afterwards. For it is better to pay money than to lose 
life and everything. 

Render therefore , &c. That is, give to Caesar the didrachma , which 
he rightly exacts from you to sustain the burdens of the state, and 
especially to maintain soldiers to defend you against the attacks of 
enemies. But give God also the didrachma — tithes , oblations , victims , 
as S. Jerome says, such as are prescribed in Leviticus, which He, 
by the right of supreme dominion, demands of you as His creatures,

S. MATTHEW, C. XXII. 


and as faithful to Him. “Because,” says Origen, “a man renders 
to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, it is not a hindrance to him in 
rendering to God what belongs to God.” The rights which belong 
to Caesar are different from those which belong to God. Political 
obligations are not adverse to religion ; neither is religion adverse 
to political duties. “ Wherefore, since Tiberius Caesar reigns over 
you, and you are his subjects, which clearly is the case, because he 
has the right of coining money, I mean the denarius of such a weight 
and value as seems good to him ; and inasmuch as you yourselves, 
by receiving the coin of the census from Tiberius, as your prince, 
acknowledge that you are his subjects, and bound to pay his taxes, 
— therefore by this very fact you are under obligation to pay.” 
“What Christ spoke with His mouth,” says S. Bernard ( Epist. 42), 
“ He was careful to fulfil in act This Creator of Caesar delayed not 
to pay tribute to Caesar.” Hear Tertullian {lib. de idololat. c. 15), 
“ Render to Ccesar the things of Ccesar , and to God the things of God, 
i.e.y the image of Caesar, which is in money, to Caesar; and the 
image of God, which is in man, to God ; so that thou mayest give 
money to Caesar, to God thyself.” And S. Chrysostom, “When 
thou hearest that the things of Caesar must be rendered to Caesar, 
doubt not that those things only are spoken of which do no harm 
to piety and religion to pay them. For the tribute, or toll, which is 
opposed to virtue or the faith, is the tribute and revenue of the 
deviL” And S. Hilary says, “If we have nothing in our possession 
which belongs to Caesar, then we are free from the obligation of 
giving him that which is his.” Which is as though Christ said, “ If 
ye wish to be exempt from tribute, renounce all things, as I and the 
apostles have done ; for where there is nothing, there Caesar hath 
no right.” 

Politically : Christ here tacitly admonishes Caesars and sovereigns 
that, being contented with what belongs to them, they mpst not 
intermeddle with the affairs of God and the Church. Wisely and 
piously did Constantine the Great, as Eusebius testifies ( Vita Con- 
stant iv. 24), say to the prelates of the Church, “ You are bishops 
within the Church ; I have been appointed by God a bishop without

the Church.” And Valentinian the Eider said, “It is not lawful 
for me, who am a layman, to interfere in such matters as this.” 
When his son, Valentinian the Younger, was instigated by his 
mother, Justina, who was an Arian, to ask for a church from S. 
Ambrose (as he himself relates, Epist. 33, ad Marccllinam), he heard 
the following reply: “Do not burden yourself, O emperor, by 
thinking that you have any imperial rights over things divine. Do 
not lift up yourself ; but if you desire a long reign, be subject to 
God ; for it is written, * Give the things of God to God, the things 
of Caesar to Caesar.’ To the emperor pertain palaces, but churches 
to the priest You have authority over fortifications, not sacred 
buildings.” And Hosius of Cordova said to the Arian emperor Con- 
stantius, “Do not intermeddle with matters ecclesiastical, neither 
give us orders with respect to such things, but rather learn them 
from us. To thee God has entrusted the imperial power, to us the 
things of the Church.” And Theodosius the Younger said (Epist 
ad Cone , . EpJusin.), “It is wickedness for one who has not been 
enrolled in the catalogue of the holy bishops to thrust himself into 
ecclesiastical affairs and deliberations.” 

Tropologically : S. Hilary says, “We are bound to render unto 
God the things of God, our body, soul, and will ; for the coin of 
Caesar is in gold, in which his image is engraven ; but God’s coin 
is man, in whom is the image of God. Give your money then to 
Caesar, but keep for God the consciousness of your innocence.” And 
S. Augustine says, “To God must be given Christian love, to kings 
human fear.” And S. Bernard, or whoever was the author of the book 
on the Lord’s Passion, says (cap. 3), “ Render unto Caesar the penny 
which has Caesar’s image ; render unto God the soul which He created 
after His own image and likeness, and ye shall be righteous.” 

Symbolically: the author of the sermon to the Brethren in the 
wilderness (apud S. Augus. tom . 10, sum. 7) says, “Then do we 
render to Caesar the things of Caesar, when we pay to the Saints 
the reverence ( dulia ) which is due to them ; and we give the things 
of God to God, when we render unto Him that Divine worship 
( latria ) which is due to Him alone.”

Lastly: S. Augustine (in Sententiis , Sent 15) rightly applies 
these words to vows, and those who make vows. “ Whosoever 
thinks well of what he may vow to God, and what vowing pay, let 
him vow and render himself. This is required, and this is due. 
Let Caesar’s image be rendered to Caesar, God’s image to God. 
This is what the Psalmist commands when he says, ‘ Vow, and 
pay unto the Lord your God; all ye who are round about Him 
bring presents’” (Ps. lxxvi. 12). 

Ver. 22. And when they heard, they marvelled, &c. They 
marvelled at the wisdom of Christ, who thus easily extricated 
Himself horn the snare which to the Pharisees seemed so im- 
possible of escape, and twisted it round their own necks, who 
had laid it, according to the words of the Psalm, “In their own 
net which they laid privily is their foot taken.” And again it is 
said (Prov. xxi. 30), “ There is neither wisdom, nor prudence, nor 
counsel against the Lord.” 

Ver. 23. Then there came unto Him , &a The Sadducees had 
heard Christ teaching the Resurrection, and by means of it per- 
suading men to repentance and a holy life. They oppose Him 
therefore with this question, which seemed to them unanswerable, 
in order that they might confute and overthrow Christ and His 
doctrine by the absurdities in which they thought to involve Him. 

Ver. 24. Saying, Master, &c. Seed ’ i.e., posterity , a son, as the 
Syriac translates, who should be called after the name of the dead, 
that so the dead man might seem still to survive in him. This law 
is found in Deut xxv. 5. 

The Sadducees expected by this question to confound Christ 
For if He should say the woman was the wife of one of the men, 
it would incite the other brothers to wrath, and envy, and perpetual 
strife, since there was no reason why she should be given to one 
more than another. For the first husband, who might seem to 
have had the best right to her, lost his right by death. If, on the 
other hand, Christ had said that she was the wife in common of all 
the seven, they would have accused Him as a teacher of shameful 
doctrine and public incest It was as though they said, “Such

are the absurdities which follow from the doctrine of the Resurrec- 
tion. Thou therefore, O Christ, ought not to assert it And thus 
your silly followers imagine, in their stupidity, that you are wise.” 
Then Christ, by a word, brushes aside their fallacy, as it were a 
spider's web, and shows them their ignorance, by adding what these 
men with their crass and carnal minds never took into considera- 
tion, namely, that in the world to come this widow would be no 
one’s wife at all. 

Know not the Scriptures , which clearly declare the Resurrection, 
as Job xix. 25 ; 2 Macc. vii. 9 et seq. and xiL 44; Isa. xxvi 19 
and lxvi. 14; Ezek. xxxvil 1, 9; Dan. xiL 12, &c. 

The power of God ; Gr. dum/m. He means, “ Ye know not that 
God is omnipotent, and therefore can raise to life again the bodies 
which have been reduced to dust, even as He created them out of 
nothing at the beginning. For greater power is required to create 
a thing out of nothing than to raise it from the dead.” Christ here 
touches upon the double root of the Sadducean error. The first was 
ignorance of the Scriptures, which clearly teach the Resurrection. 
The other was ignorance, or want of consideration, of the omni- 
potence of God. This caused them to interpret the Scriptures 
which treat of the Resurrection as referring to a mystical resurrec- 
tion from vice to virtue. 

In the Resurrection % i.e., in the world to come, in Heaven, and 
celestial bliss. Nor are given in marriage ; for women who are 
good and modest do not choose husbands for themselves, but are 
given to husbands by their parents. 

But they shall be as the angels , &c. The blessed in Heaven after 
the Resurrection shall be like the angels, not by nature, but, 1, by 
purity ; 2, by spiritual life, for they live by spiritual not corporeal 
food ; 3, by incorruption and immortality ; 4, by happiness and 
glory, in which, like the angels, they will continue for all eternity. 
Wherefore there will be no need then of marriage and generation ; 
for these things have been instituted for the perpetuation of the 
race and the individual, by means of children. Because the father 
is mortal, therefore he begets a son, that after death he may live

and continue in his son. But in Heaven there shall be no death, 
and they shall live for ever. Marriage, therefore, and procreation 
of children would be without an object there. Wherefore S. Luke 
adds (xx. 35), Neither can they die any mare. Appositely says 
S. Augustine (Quasi, Evang, in Luc. xx. 35), “Marriage is for the 
sake of children, children for the sake of succession, succession on 
account of death. Where, therefore, death is not, marriage is not” 

S. Luke adds, And they are the sons of God \ being the sons of the 
Resurrection, Blessed are they that rise again ; they shall be like 
God both in body and soul; for they shall be spiritual, glorious, 
immortal, and eternal as God is, forasmuch as they are bom the 
sons of the Resurrection, and are born again to a blessed and 
endless life, wherefore they shall neither need nor delight in the 
procreation of children. 

From this passage Auctor Imperfecti teaches that chastity is the 
most angelic of all the virtues. The angels know not by experience 
the meaning of lust And S. Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat, 12) calls 
“virginity the conversation of angels and the purity of incorporeal 
nature.” Wherefore S. Basil (de Virginit. 79) teaches that virginity 
is the seed of future incorruption ; yea, that virgins anticipate here, 
and begin that future likeness with the angels in Heaven, and 
desire to be rewarded with its perfection there, by constant 
struggling with and victory over the flesh here. S. Basil adds that 
chastity makes us like not only to the angels, but to God Himself. 
“How great and glorious a thing,” saith he, “is virginity, which 
makes a corruptible man most like unto God, that he should 
receive the similitude of God in himself, as in a most clear mirror, 
from God Himself, with His favours flowing unto him after the 
manner of a most sweet ray (of light) 1 ” 

Elegantly and piously saith S. Bernard, “What is more beautiful 
than chastity, which makes clean what hath been conceived unclean, 
which makes a servant of an enemy, and, in short, an angel of a 
man ? For a chaste man differs from an angel only in felicity, not 
in virtue. Although the chastity of the one has more happiness, 
the chastity of the other is stronger. Chastity stands alone in

ARE THERE THE SEXES IN HEAVEN?

this — that in the place and time of mortality it represents the state 
of immortality. In the midst of marriage rites, it alone asserts the 
customs of that blessed country, in which they neither marry nor 
are given in marriage, affording here on earth some experience of 
that celestial converse.” 

Lastly, from this place S. Hilary, S. Athanasius (Serm. 3, cont 
Arian .), S. Basil (in Ps. cxiv.), S. Jerome (in Eph. iv. 13), upon 
the words, “ until we all come ... to a perfect man,” seem to assert 
that after the Resurrection, in Heaven, there will be no female sex, 
as there is none in the angels, so that all females will be changed 
into males, and rise again in the male sex. S. Augustine testifies 
that many held this opinion in his own day (de Civit xxii. 19). 

But S. Augustine himself teaches the contrary. So does SL 
Chrysostom in this passage and Tertullian (lib. de Resurrect, ;), also 
S. Jerome and the Scholastics, passim. The a priori reason is, 
that the female sex is not a defect (vitium\ but a natural condition. 
It existed in a state of innocence in Paradise. For Eve was 
created by God to be “the mother of all living,” as Adam was 
created a man. Now, in the Resurrection the same nature shall 
rise again altogether in every one whatsoever; and with this the 
difference of sex has much to do. Sex, therefore, shall then 
remain, lest different individuals, different men from what they 
were in this life, should seem to rise again. The same thing is 
clear from the words of Christ They neither marry nor are given 
in marriage . They neither marry , spoken of males, nor are given in 
marriage , of females. Christ, therefore, so far from denying, pre- 
supposes that there will then be females ; but in such manner that 
sex will not be used for the purposes of marriage and generation. 
And this is what is to be understood as the meaning of the Fathers 
above cited, who seem at first to hold a different opinion. 

Vers. 31, 32. But concerning the resurrection of the dead , &c. 
Christ, not satisfied with having refuted the Sadducean objection 
to the Resurrection, proceeds to prove it to them by the words of 
God to Moses, 1 am the God of Abraham , &c Although Christ 
might have cited clearer proofs of the Resurrection from Job,

Isaiah, &c., He preferred this from the Pentateuch, because it only 
did the Sadducees receive. They rejected the Prophets. So 
Origen, Bede, and others. Josephus says of the Sadducees, “They 
are of opinion that nothing besides the Law is to be observed." 
Although in that passage Josephus may be more properly taken as 
speaking of the Law as opposed, not to the Prophets, but to 
traditions (Ant 18. 2), and to include the Prophets under the Law. 
For otherwise they would have been manifest heretics, and would 
have been disavowed as such by all the rest of the Jews. Where- 
fore a better reason for this quotation would seem to be, that the 
authority of Moses was of greater weight with the Jews than that 
of the Prophets. The highest veneration was given to Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, as their great forefathers, whom also they 
regarded not as dead, but as living with God, and taking care of 
the Hebrews, their posterity. Whence no one would dare openly 
to assert that they had ceased to exist 

I am the God of Abraham. First, as though it were said, “I am 
God, who boast of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as of My faithful 
prophets and friends ; and who entered into covenant with them, 
to give the land of Canaan to them, that is, to their descendants. 
And this, dwelling with Me in the Limbus of the Fathers, they 
continually ask of Me. And I should not glory in them unless 
they were alive, forasmuch as I am especially the living God, and 
the Giver of life. They therefore themselves live as to the soul, 
and in consequence shall live in the Resurrection as to the body 
also ; and that too in a very short time, even as it were in a few 
days, when I shall rise from death. Then shall I raise them 
also from the dead, and shall carry them with Me in triumph to 
Heaven." See S. Matt xxvii. 52. 

Here observe that the Sadducees and Epicurean philosophers 
denied the Resurrection, because they denied the immortality of the 
soul. The two things are closely connected. For if the soul is 
immortal, since it naturally has an interpendence with that ( pro- 
pendeat) of which it is the form, it verily behoves that the body 
should rise again. Otherwise the soul would continue always in an

unnatural condition, and would only possess, as it were, a semi- 
existence. 

ad. S. Chrysostom, Irenaeus (/. 4, c 11) say that Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob do not signify the souls only of those Patriarchs, 
but the entire men. They therefore, though they be dead to men, 
are living unto God. They are, as it were, asleep ; and God shall 
shortly awake them out of sleep, to a blessed and eternal life. 
Thus Luke adds, by way of explanation, For all live unto Him. 

But when the Pharisees had heard , &c. They wished to humble 
Him, as imagining Him to be puffed up with His victory over the 
Sadducees, and to hurl back upon Himself the charge of ignorance 
of the Scriptures which He had brought against the Sadducees. 
But these foolish men only kicked against the pricks. For Christ 
is the eternal Truth and Wisdom, who reveals to all men the dark- 
ness of their ignorance. 

' . And a certain lawyer asked Him , &c This was one of the 
Pharisees, who put himself forward to propose a most difficult 
question to Jesus, in order to try whether or not He was skilful in 
the Law and in the Scriptures ; not only in speculative matters, such 
as was the question of the Sadducees, but in practical matters 
likewise. The word tempting means the same as trying , making 
proof. For this man, although he pretended, in the presence of 
the Pharisees, that he wished to catch and entrap Jesus, yet in his 
heart desired to hear what Jesus would reply to this most difficult 
question, about which he himself hung in doubt So, when he 
heard Jesus answer, that love of God and our neighbour is the 
greatest of the commandments, he immediately expressed his 
approval by saying, Well, Master, Thou hast said the truth f &c. 
And Jesus said to him , Thou hast answered wisely : thou art not far 
from the kingdom of God 

Master, which is the first commandment in the Law ? Bede says 
(in Mark c. 12) that this was a much debated point of controversy 
among the Jews in the time of Christ. Many of them thought 
that the chief commandment of the Law was concerning sacrifices 
and victims to be offered to God according to the Levitical Law f

S. MATTHEW, C. XXII. 


because by these God is properly worshipped as Lord above all. 
And this was why the Pharisees told children to say to their 
parents, corban . This, too, shows why the lawyer, when he heard 
Christ’s answer, said accordingly, To love (God), and onds neighbour 
as onds self, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices 
(Mark xii. 33). 

Ver. 37. Jesus saith to him , &c. Moses, in Deut. vi. 5, and from 
thence Mark and Luke add, with all thy strength. The Persian 
has, with the utmost power of thy mind . This answers to the 
Hebrew meodecha of Deuteronomy. 

Observe, as against Calvin, that this precept is in every one’s 
power as possible to keep. For the complete and highest love of 
God, in its utmost extent, is not that which is here spoken of, but 
that only which is to be understood comparatively. Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy hearty and soul , and mind, is 
the same thing as to say, Thou shalt love God with thy whole 
will, namely, 1st Comparatively , that thou shalt give no portion 
of thy love to an idol, or to anything whatsoever that is contrary 
to God. 2d. Finally , that altogether thou shouldst wish God to 
be the final object of all thy thoughts, actions, and thy love; 
and that thou shouldst choose Him as thy chief Good and Last 
End, before all things whatsoever. 3d. Appreciatively , that thou- 
shouldst esteem nothing as of so much worth as God, in such 
manner that thou shouldst apply thy whole heart, that is, thy will, 
to fulfil all His precepts, and to be obedient to Him in all things. 
What is here spoken of as the whole heart , is called in other pas- 
sages an entire and perfect heart . Hence the expression so often 
repeated, His heart was perfect with God. (See 1 Kings xiv. 8, &c) 
This is what S. Bernard says in his Treatise on the love of God 
“ The measure of loving God- is, to love without measure.” 

Ver. 38. This is the greatest and first commandment For the 
greatest virtue, and the queen of all virtues, is charity Wherefore 
charity is more noble than religious worship (religione). For it 
is more noble to love God with all the heart than to offer Him 
sacrifices. You may add fhat charity, like a queen, commands

LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR.

sacrifices and all other acts of religion. Lastly, love is the most 
noble affection and act (of the soul), and is more excellent than 
fear, honour, and all others. 

The second is like, &c., as thyself; Syr. as thy soul. Second — not 
in order of legislation, but of dignity and perfection, although far 
below the first For God is far more to be loved than all angels 
and men, and all creatures whatsoever. But after God, among 
creatures, our neighbour is to be loved above all things. Like, in 
love and affection, and in the duties and offices which spring from 
them. 

Christ here omits love of ourselves. For this is innate with all, 
and a natural property, as it were ; in such wise, that if thou hast 
charity towards others, thou shouldst exercise it first to thyself 
“For he who is bad to himself to whom will he be good? 1 ’ 
Whence Christ here presupposes that love of oneself, yea, appoints 
it, as it were, the ideal and the measure of love to our neighbour, 
saying love as thyself Wherefore S. Augustine says {lib. i, de 
Doct. Christ, c. 27), “ Love of thyself is not here omitted, for it is 
said. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” 

In the first place, then, God is to be loved with the whole heart 
above everything. Secondly, one’s own self. Thirdly, one’s 
neighbour. In the expression, as thyself, the word as does not 
signify equality, but similarity of love. For we ought to love our- 
selves more than our neighbour; but yet the same things which 
we desire for ourselves we ought to desire for our neighbour. 
(See Lev. xix. 18, where I have expounded the law.) The Hebrew 
PI properly signifies companion. But the Vulgate translates neigh- 
hour, in order to give a great stimulus of love to every one ; because 
every man, which is what is here meant, is very near, and most 
closely united to us, and, as it were, out brother. This is both by

Father; as also by re-creation, because we have been regenerated

Body and Blood in the Eucharist.

heart ; and our neighbour , not with the whole heart, but as ourselves. 
This does not mean — ist. That thou shouldst love thyself only, 
and neglect thy neighbour, which is what self-love, arising from a 
nature corrupted by sin, suggests ; but that thou shouldst extend to 
thy neighbour the love wherewith thou lovest thyself. 2d That 
as thou dost not love thyself frigidly, nor feignedly, but ardently 
and sincerely ; so, in like manner, shouldst thou love thy neigh- 
bour. This is what Christ sanctioned when He said, 44 Whatsoever 
ye would that men should do unto you, do likewise unto them.” 
And what Tobias, when he was dying, commanded his son ( Tob. iv. 
16), “What thou hatest that another should do unto thee, take 
heed that thou do not to another.” 44 For this is the law of love,” 
says S. Augustine {de Vera Religion . c. 46), that the good things 
which a man wishes to come to himself, he should wish likewise for 
his neighbour. And the evils which he wishes not to happen to 
himself, he should be unwilling for them to happen to him.” Dost 
thou wish that thy property, thy honour, thy wife, thy life should be 
taken from thyself? Do not take them from others. Dost thou 
wish that they should be given and preserved to thyself? Do thou 
likewise preserve them for others. 

On these two, , &c. All the precepts of the Law and the Prophets 
rest upon these two commandments of love. Indeed, they spring 
and grow out of them, just as many branches spring from one tree 
and one root. Wherefore in these two precepts all are contained, 
as in their principles and premisses. For all commandments are 
included in the Decalogue. And the Decalogue contains nothing 
else except precepts of love to God and our neighbour. The three 
commandments of the first Table deal with love to God. The seven 
commandments of the second Table deal with love to our neighbour, 
as S. Augustine says {lib. 8, de Trin . c. 7). Wherefore the Apostle 
says {Rom. xiii. 9), 44 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, 
Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false 
witness, Thou shalt not covet ; and if there be any other command- 
ment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt 
love thy neighbour as thyself” For all the precepts of mercy, and

of all the other virtues, natural and supernatural, have to do with 
these two commandments of love to God and our neighbour, and 
are contained in them. The precepts of faith, hope, and charity, 
and of religious worship, are included in love to God. The precepts 
of justice, truth, fidelity, friendship* mercy, gratitude, are included 
in love to our neighbour. Christ, therefore, signifies that these two 
precepts ought to be always in every one’s heart, and ought to 
direct their whole life. 

Ver. 41. When the Pharisees were gathered together, \ &c. This 
was in the Temple, as appears from Mark xii. 35. Christ made use 
of this occasion of the Pharisees tempting Him to instruct them 
concerning the Person and dignity of Messiah, that He might teach 
how to return good for evil, and turn a temptation into an occasion 
of instruction. He taught them that Messiah, or the Christ, was 
not a mere man, as they supposed, but the God-Man. They must 
not wonder, therefore, that He asserted Himself to be the Son of 
God. 

Ver. 42. Whose Son is Christ ? They say unto Him , David's. 
They ought to have said, that Christ, as God, will be the Son of 
God ; Christ, as man, will be the son of David. But as to the first, 
the Pharisees were either ignorant or unbelieving. Wherefore they 
only made the second reply. But even from it Christ draws and 
proves the former. When Peter was asked, whom he thought 
Christ to be, being inspired by God he answered, Thou art the 
Christ the Son of the Living God. But the Pharisees were devoid 
of the Divine inspiration, wherefore they savoured only of human 
things, and believed Christ to be only a man. 

Observe: Luke and Mark relate these things somewhat dif- 
ferently; but the apparent discrepancy is to be reconciled by 
considering that the meaning of the two former Evangelists is, that 
Christ, in the first place, asked the Pharisees, “ Whose son was 
Christ?” They replied that the Scribes, or Doctors of the Law, 
said, “that He was the son of David.” Then Christ rejoined, 
“ How say the Scribes that Christ is the son of David, when David 
calls Him his Lord?”

S. %ATTHEW, C. xxn. 


David in Spirit, being inspired by the Holy Ghost For the 
Holy Ghost dictated the Psalms to David, endued him with their 
living sense. Therefore it was not so much David in Spirit, as 
the Spirit in David, which thus spake. 

Calleth Him lord, for the son is less than his father. Wherefore 
the father is not wont to call the son his lord, but the son his father, 
as is common with the Italians and other nations. From this 
passage the modern Rabbins are confuted, who expound this 
noth Psalm not of Messiah, or Christ, but of Abraham, or David, 
or Hezekiah. For the Scribes and Pharisees of Christ’s time 
understood it of Christ, and regarded it as a prophecy of Him. 
For had they not done so, they would have replied that Christ 
wrongly applied the Psalm to Messiah, when it ought to be under- 
stood of Abraham or David, &c. That it does apply to Christ is 
evident from the 4th verse of the same Psalm, With Thee is the 
beginning (secum principium , Vulg.), the headship , which is the force 
of the Heb. ntonj, nedabot, and the Gr. d>x*i, in the day of thy 
strength, in the splendours of the saints : from the womb, before the 
day-star , / have begotten Thee (Vulg.). This can refer to no one 
save Christ. Lastly, Jonathan, the Chaldee, Rabbi Barachias, R. 
Levi, and the ancient Rabbins take it as referring only to Christ 
Ver. 44. Saying, The Lord said, &c. From this verse Christ 
clearly proves that the Messiah was not a mere man, as the Pharisees 
believed, but that He was David's God, and therefore his Lord. 
The meaning therefore is as if David said, “ The Lord God hath 
said to my Lord, even Christ, Sit on My right hand, in that after 
the Death and Resurrection of Christ He will raise Him up, and 
exalt Him above all powers and principalities, and will set Him 
next to Himself in Heaven, that He may reign with the most perfect 
happiness, glory, and authority over all created things.” 

The Heh. for said is DtO, neum, Le., pronounced, spoken pro- 
phetically, decreed by the Lord concerning David’s Lord, and there- 
fore something fixed, certain, immutable. For neum is, by metathesis, 
the same as Amen, or sure and faithful. And the meaning is, that 
“ God the Father from eternity hath firmly and inviolably decreed

concerning Christ His Son, not as He is God, but in that He 
became Incarnate and was made man (for this is the force of the 
Heb. Adoni), that He is, by virtue both of the Hypostatic 
Union and of the Redemption which He accomplished on the 
Cross, of all men, and therefore of David, the Lord.” He hath said , 
interiorly in His own mind, from all eternity. But He said also, in 
the sense that He will say at the time of the Ascension of Christ 
in triumph into Heaven, “ Come and sit on My right hand ; reign 
and triumph in the glory of My majesty.” So S. Jerome, Theodoret, 
and others. For this noth Psalm celebrates the most “ glorious 
Kingdom of Christ both in Heaven and earth — that kingdom in 
which Christ, after His Ascension, began from Zion and Jerusalem 
to reign over all nations, and by His Apostles to bring them to His 
faith and worship, until He shall put down all His enemies, that is, 
all the wicked, under His feet in the day of judgment.” 

Thy footstool \ This means, reign with Me in glory, until I make 
all Thine enemies subject unto Thee. Thus it is said that Sapor, 
king of Persia, made use of the Emperor Aurelian, whom he had 
taken captive in battle, to mount upon his horse, placing his foot 
upon the back of the emperor, as upon a kind of footstool. 

The expression until here does not signify end or conclusion, 
but continuation and amplification of sitting and reigning. Reign 
even in the time which seems contrary and opposed to Thy King- 
dom, even when Thine enemies shall seem to reign rather than 
Thee. Reign even in the midst of crosses, persecutions, and the 
tumults of Satan and his ministers. 

And no one was able to answer Him a word ; Syr. to give Him 
a reason; because, as I have said, they believed Messiah to be 
a mere man. “They were silent,” says S. Chrysostom, “being 
smitten with a mortal blow.” “They preferred,” says S. Augus- 
tine, “to be broken to pieces in their swelling taciturnity, rather 
than to be instructed by lowly confession.*

32 S. MATTHEW, C. XXIII. 

Then Jesus spake , &c. Then, that is to say, when, by His most 
wise answers and reasonings, He had confounded the errors of the 
Scribes and Pharisees, and had proved that He was the Messiah, 
— then, I say, He put to rebuke their persistent effrontery by this 
powerful and pathetic speech, by which He uncovered their feigned 
appearance of sanctity, and showed their lurking dishonesty, so that 
the people might avoid it 

Saying, &c By seat we here understand the honour , dignity, and 
authority of teaching and commanding, which Moses had with the 
Jews, and to which the Scribes had succeeded. We gather from 
S. Luke iv. 16, that the Scribes not only sat, but sometimes stood 
when they taught. In like manner, the chair of S. Peter is used to 
signify the power and authority of teaching and ruling all the faithful 
throughout the world, in which the Roman Pontiffs succeed S. Peter. 
For otherwise no Pontiff ever sits now in that actual wooden chair 
in which S. Peter sat, but it is religiously preserved in his basilica, 
and is shown to the people every year on the Feast of S. Peter’s 
Chair, to be venerated. Hence S. Jerome said to Damasus, “ I am . 
united in communion to your blessedness, that is, to the chair of 
Peter.” For although as a private man the Pontiff may err, yet 
when he defines anything ex cathedra, that is, by his Pontifical 
authority concerning the faith, he cannot err, because he is assisted 
by the Holy Ghost 

Observe, many of the Scribes and Pharisees were priests or 
Levites, whose duty it was to teach the people (Mai. ii. 7). But 
Christ did not wish to name the Priests, because He would not 
derogate from the sacerdotal honour. 

All things therefore whatsoever, &c. He means, of course, all 
things not contrary to Moses and the Law. For the doctrine of the 
Scribes, when they taught men to say corban to their parents, was 
contrary to the Law, as Christ showed (xv. 4). In like manner, it 
was contrary to the Law of Moses to teach, as the Scribes did, that 
Jesus was not the Messiah, or the Christ. For Jesus showed those 
very signs and miracles which Moses and the Prophets had foretold 
Messiah would perform. In such things, therefore, the people

must not follow the doctrine of the Scribes, nor be obedient to 
them; but in other things, in which their teaching was generally 
conformable to the Law of Moses, it was their duty to obey them. 
Christ therefore here teaches that all the other dogmas of the 
Scribes, which were not repugnant to the law, even though they 
were vain and foolish, and therefore not binding (for that a law 
should be obligatory, it must command something honest and 
useful, as Civilians and Theologians teach in their treatises upon 
laws, also D. Thomas, i. a, quasi. 95, art 3), such as were the 
frequent washings of the hands and other parts of the body, might 
yet serve for the merit of blind and simple obedience, and for 
reverence of the sacerdotal order. So Jansen, Franc Lucas, and 
others. But Maldonatus restricts the word all to such commands 
alone as are contained in the Law of Moses. Certainly these were 
what Christ chiefly referred to. 

For they say , Le., command \ and do not They teach and order 
well, but they live ill. They both break the law, and scandalise 
their subjects by their evil example, and thus incite them likewise 
to break the law. For as one hath said, " The whole world com- 
ports itself according to the king's example," we may add, of the 
Teacher's likewise For men give more credit to deeds than they 
do to words. Christians ought to bear in mind these words of 
Christ when they see certain Bishops, Pastors, and Magistrates not 
living in accordance with the law of Christ 

For they bind . . . upon men f s shoulders; Arab, upon their necks ; 
Gr. ditfitOwti, Le., they bind and \ as it were 9 gather them together in 
heaps . This signifies both the multitude and the heavy weight of 
the precepts with which they burden the people. 

Unbearable ; Vulg. Gr. dve/3oL<rraxra t as English version, difficult 
to be bome 9 rather than impossible . Such were the numerous precepts, 
beyond what the Law required, concerning oblations, tithes, first- 
fruits, &c. Consider only the vigorous observance of the Sabbath, 
which they enjoined, so that they would not allow Christ to heal 
the sick on that day, nor suffer His disciples to satisfy their hunger 
by plucking ears of corn.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIII. 


Move them; Vulg. Syr. and English Version, touch them . As 
S. Chrysostom says, “ He shows that theirs was a double wicked- 
ness, both because they wish the multitude to live in the strictest 
possible manner, without the least indulgence, and because, indulg- 
ing themselves inordinately, they assume great licence. Which 
things are the very opposite of what is required in a good prince. 
For such a one permits himself no indulgence, but is mild towards 
his subjects, and ready to bestow pardon.” 

All things that they may be seen ; Gr. Ot*drj vcu, Le., be a spectacle. 
He notes their vain ostentation of sanctity in praying in the public 
streets, &c Christ here touches upon the root of the incredulity 
of the Scribes, that they would not believe in Him, because they 
sought after vainglory and the applause of men. “For it is im- 
possible,” says S. Chrysostom, “ that he who covets the earthly glory 
of men should believe in Christ preaching heavenly things.” 

They make large their fringes ; Vulg. They prolong the fringes 
of their cloaks; Syr. They, the Jews, interpreted too literally the 
words of Deut. vi. 8, “ Thou shalt bind them, *>., the precepts of 
God, for a sign upon thine hands, and they shall be moved (Vulg.) 
before thine eyes.” They bore certain pieces of parchment about 
their arms and foreheads. Whence they were called armlets and 
frontlets. They did this that they might strike against their eyes 
and foreheads, and admonish them to meditate upon and keep the 
Divine Law. The words inscribed upon the pieces of parchment 
were, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.” “Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy strength.” They were called phylacteries, from 
faXdrru, to guards to keep % because they put them in constant 
remembrance of observing the law. 

For a similar reason, in Num. xv. 38 and Deut xxil 12, the Lord 
commanded the Jews to wear fringe^ threads depending from the 
lowest skirt of their garments, and that they should be of a light 
blue or dark blue colour, as men who professed and lived the 
heavenly life by keeping the law. S. Jerome adds that the more 
devout Jews were wont to insert very sharp thorns in these fringes,

that being pricked by them as they walked, they might be always 
reminded of the Divine Law. All these things the Pharisees wore 
larger and broader than other people, that they might appear to all 
to be stricter observers of the law, although they made but little of 
it in their minds. “Not understanding,” says S. Jerome, “that 
these things should be carried in the heart, not in the body, for 
bookcases and chests have books, but have not therefore the know- 
ledge of God.” Moreover, S. Chrysostom, by phylacteries , under- 
stands amulets worn to preserve health, for such the Scribes 
esteemed the pieces of parchment described above. In the same 
way, some Christians wear the Gospel of S. John about their necks 
as a kind of charm to preserve health. 

And salutations in the market-places ; Vulg. in the forum. S. 
Chrysostom says, “They love the first salutations, not only as 
regards time, that we should salute them first, but also as regards 
the voice, that we should cry out, * Hail, Rabbi ; * and as regards 

the body, that we should bow the head to them ; and as regards 

place, that we should salute them in public.” Wisely saith R. 
Matthies in Pirke Avoth, “ Always be the first to salute every one. 
Be the tail of lions, and not the head of foxes ; that is, be the 

lowest among good and honourable men, not the chief among 

deceitful, proud, and impious ones.” 

Rabbi ’, from 3T, ue., much or great, because a great man, such as 
a Rabbi, or Doctor of the Law, was equivalent to many persons, as 
excelling others in learning and authority. Well saith R. Benzoma 
in Pirke Avoth, “ Who is a wise man ? He who willingly learns of 
all, according to the words, * 1 had more understanding than the 
aged, because I sought Thy commandments.' Who is the mighty 
man ? He who rules over anger, and his own spirit, according to 
the saying, ‘ Better is the patient man than the strong, and he that 
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city ' (Prov. xvi. 32). Who 
is the rich? He that is contented with his own, as it is said 
(Ps. cxxviii.), 1 Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands ; O well 
is thee, and happy shalt thou be.' Who is honoured? He that 
honoureth others, as it is written, * Him that honoureth Me I

will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly 
esteemed.* ” 

But be not ye called Rabbi 9 &c. He forbids the ambition of the 
Scribes and Pharisees, who desired to be honoured and called 
Rabbi above Christ, yea, even to the exclusion of Christ. But it is 
lawful to desire a doctor’s degree, as a testimony of learning, that 
by it we may obtain authority, and preach, and have influence with 
the people, and by this means gain the greater fruit Wherefore 
the Council of Trent (sess. 24, c. 12) orders that all dignities, and at 
least the half of canonries in cathedral and collegiate churches, 
should be conferred only upon masters and doctors, or at least 
licentiates in theology or canon law. Christ does not say, do not be, 
but do not be called , Rabbi. 

Christ does not forbid the doctor’s degree, but the proud ambi- 
tion of the name, that by it a man should please himself and 
despise others, as though he had his knowledge and learning from 
himself, and not from Christ, which was what the Scribes did. 
Therefore He adds the reason, for one is your Master , even Christ. 
He means, there is one chief Rabbi over all, of whom all others 
are the disciples, and all are brethren, equal one to another. 
Therefore let none of them proudly lift himself above the rest, 
and wish to be called Rabbi, as though he were of himself a 
doctor and master of others, for this is a wrong done to Christ, 
who alone has all wisdom in Himself, and is the only supreme 
Doctor of all, who indeed makes them doctors. And in this 
lower sense Paul himself, as S. Jerome says, with modesty calls 
himself the doctor of the Gentiles. 

Call no one your father upon earth , &c. He means in the sense 
of the prime author of life and the preserver of all things, as 
though ye entirely depended upon any but God. This was what 
the Gentiles and Atheists did, and others who trusted in men rather 
than in God. That this is the meaning, is plain from the reason 
which He subjoins, for one is your Father , &c. “ Of whom the 

whole family in Heaven and earth is named” ( Eph . iii. 15). God 
therefore is the only real Father of all, forasmuch as He only gives

soul and life, creates, and preserves. In comparison of Him, says 
S. Jerome, earthly fathers are only so in a figurative sense, and 
ought not therefore insolently to command their children, but 
ought to submit themselves together with their children to God, 
the chief Father of alL 

Neither be ye called, , i.e., be not ambitious of being called masters; 
Vulg. magistri ; Gr. xatojyjjra/, or governors , moderators; Syr. 
rulers ; for One is the Ruler and Orderer, Gr. xa<h)yr)rTjg, of your 
life, that is, Christ. He Himself, in the first place, by Himself 
teaches us, and leads us by the way of virtue to heavenly glory. 
All others teach as they have been first taught by Him. Secondly, 
all others only teach in words that sound in the outward ears, like a 
tinkling cymbal; but Christ makes known their meaning inwardly 
to the mind. For, as S. Chrysostom says, “ it is not man who gives 
man understanding by teaching, but exercises by means of admoni- 
tion what has been ordained by God.” Thirdly, all others only 
show what the law commands and what God requires ; but Christ 
gives grace to the will, that we, when we hear the things which ought 
to be done, may indeed constantly fulfil the same. 

He that is the greater of you t &c. “ He teaches,” says S. 

Chrysostom, “that the disease of vainglory must be got rid of by 
humility.” And Origen says, “If any one ministers the divine 
words, knowing that it is Christ who produces fruit by His means, 
he by no means holds himself forth as a master, but a minister.” 
Whence it follows, He that is the greatest &c., because even Christ 
Himself who is the true Master, hath professed Himself to be a 
minister, in that He saith, I am among you as he that ministereth ; 
and well does He add after the whole saying, He that exalteth 
himself shall be abased ; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted 
These words are true as applied both to God and men, says 
Remigius. For both God and men exalt the humble and depress 
the proud. “ Glory follows them that flee from it, and flees from 
those who pursue it God will bring down insolent pride from its 
lofty height, and will raise up humility to glory,” says S. Hilary. 

Blessed Peter Damian gives a memorable example ( Epist . 15).

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIII. 


There was, he says, a certain bold and warlike clergyman, who 
became great by means of his pride and his arms. And he had 
in consequence a quarrel about certain estates with another 
powerful man, which he determined to decide by the fortune of 
war, and the troops of both were drawn up in battle array. The 
clergyman before the battle went into a church and heard Mass. 
It chanced that the words of the Gospel were read, He that exalteth 
himself shall be abased. When he heard them he said insolently, or 
rather blasphemously, “ These words are falsified in me, for if I 
had humbled myself I should never have become as great as I am.” 
By and by, in the heat of battle, his horse being very thirsty, ran, 
contrary to his wish, to some water that was near. He struck his 
horse with his shield, in order to cause it to return into the battle, 
when, behold, an enemy’s sword transfixed that blaspheming mouth 
of his like a thunderbolt, and slew him, humbling his pride and 
casting him down to the ground, showing that the words of Christ 
are indeed true. 

Ver. 13. Woe unto you , Scribes , &c. Observe that, as Christ 
enumerated eight beatitudes, repeating the word blessed eight times 
in S. Matt, v., so does He here bestow eight maledictions upon 
the impious Scribes, eight several times repeating the word woe. 
Christ the new Lawgiver imitates Moses, the ancient lawgiver, who 
promises many blessings to those who keep the law, and threatens 
with as many curses those who break it. Thus Origen. 

Moreover, the word woe is partly prophetic of the grave punish- 
ment which should fall upon the wickedness of the Scribes, and is 
partly condoling and pitying in its signification. Whence Basil 
says, “ This word woe, which is prefixed to intolerable pain, applies 
to those who were soon afterwards to be destroyed by dreadful 
punishments.” The word woe therefore presupposes a deadly fault, 
for it threatens the punishment of hell, as Christ explains in ver. 33. 

For ye shut , &c “ I indeed open to all the kingdom of Heaven ; 
for I preach, repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand. For 
this kingdom has been shut for four thousand years, through 
Adam’s sin. I, expiating that sin by My death, will now open it,

that whoso believeih in Me and followeth My life, may enter into 
the open kingdom. Wherefore many of the Jews, being aroused by 
My preaching, are striving to enter in. But you, O ye Scribes, turn 
them away, and shut Heaven against them by your vain and per- 
verse traditions, which ye instil into their minds.” For, as S. 
Chrysostom says, “The kingdom of Heaven is Holy Scripture; the 
door is the understanding of Scripture, or Christ ; the bearers of the 
keys are the Scribes and Priests ; the key is the word of knowledge ; 
the opening of the door is interpretation. Ye also cause men to 
offend by your wickedness and evil example; and because ye 
calumniate and persecute Me, and draw them away from believing 
in Me, which is the road to Heaven. For I am the door, because 
by Me alone there is entrance into Heaven.” 

Tropologically, they shut up the kingdom of Heaven who 
excommunicate any one without cause. 

For ye enter not in yourselves, &c This is a grievous sin. For if, 
says S. Chrysostom, it is the part of a doctor to recall the erring, 
he who draws those who are going on safely into error is altogether 
a son of perdition, yea, he is a pestilence itself. Wherefore such a 
doctor deserves, and brings upon himself as many hells as the 
number of souls whom he corrupts and destroys, because he is not 
a teacher and promoter of salvation, but a betrayer. 

Ver. 14. Woe unfo you, & c. Because ye devour, that is, exhaust, 
the substance of widows, in extracting money from them by selling 
them under a feigned appearance of sanctity your long public 
prayers. This is why He adds in explanation, making long prayers.

Wherefore ye shall receive greater damnation . The Syriac trans- 
lates, ye are about to receive the extremest judgment ; both because 
ye rob from widows, and because, as Chrysostom says, ye paint 
avarice the colour of religion, that iniquity may be loved, being 
esteemed as piety. Ye also imbue widows with your own errors 
and wickednesses. Wherefore ye ought to receive the punishment 
of your own sin and the guilt of their ignorance, as S. Hilary says.

Syriac has here and in the verses which follow, acceptors of persons. 
Proselyte means the same in Greek as advena , or stranger , in Latin, 
A proselyte was one who was converted from heathenism to 
Judaism, and became attached to the Jewish Church and religion. 
In Hebrew proselytes are called gerim. Christians call such persons 
neophytes . The Scribes strove to turn many Gentiles to Judaism, 
for the sake of ambition as well as avarice, that they might augment 
their oblations. Sea and land \ that is, the whole world. 

Ye make him the son , that is, guilty, worthy of hell \ twofold more 
than yourselves ; Gr. btr\6r%^ ufiw. For, as Euthymius says, it 
is the same as in nature, that scholars easily surpass their teachers 
in vice. “ Because,” as Chrysostom says, “ being provoked by the 
evil example of their teachers, they become worse than them, 
especially when they are stirred up by the words and examples of 
their teachers.” Again, many proselytes, when they see your evil 
doings, return to heathenism. For he who relapses commits a 
greater and, as it were, a double sin . 

Ver. 16. Woe unto you, &c. . . . but if he shall swear by the gold 
of the temple , &c., the gold, that is, which he has vowed to pay. 
Instead of he is a debtor, the Arabic translates he has sinned, that 
is, he does not pay what he has sworn. 

Observe (from the words in Matt v. 34), that the Scribes 
thought from what God had commanded, that they should swear 
by Him alone, — an oath by any creature was not an oath, nor 
obligatory; but being blinded by avarice, they excepted such 
things as, being offered to God, filled their own coffers, as if these 
alone were to be accounted most sacred Wherefore they are 
rightly called by Christ blind guides. Moreover, the Scribes were 

wont to say that the oblations were more holy than the Temple 
itself, “ that they might make men more ready for offerings than 
for prayers,” says the Gloss. He calls the gold which was cast into 
the treasury of the Temple for maintaining its ministers the gold of 
the Temple. Truly says the Gloss, u He that swears by a creature, 
swears by the Deity which presides over the creature.” 

Ye fools and blind, &c. This reasoning of Christ is clear, and

convicts the Scribes of folly. Holiness is properly interior virtue* 
and the grace which sanctifies the soul. But the Temple is here 
called holy by metonymy, because it is set apart for holy things, 
such as the offering in it of prayers and sacrifices to God. This, 
therefore, was only an external holiness which the temple com- 
municated to the other things offered in it to God. Wherefore the 
Temple was more holy than anything offered in the Temple, and 
therefore an oath made by the Temple was more binding than 
an oath made by the gold offered in the Temple. 

And whoso shall swear by the altar , &c. The same reasoning 
applies to the altar which Christ has already applied to the Temple. 

The altar which sanctifieth , Syr. consecrates , , the gift. A gift 
offered to God is not properly sanctified \ so that it should be in 
itself righteous or holy, but it is said to be sanctified extrinsically, 
because it is offered to God, and thus sanctified. 

Mystically: S. Augustine says (1 Qucest. Evang. 34), “The 
Temple and the Altar is Christ. The gold and the gifts are the 
praises and sacrifices which are offered in Him and by Him.” 
Origen says, the altar is the heart ; the gifts are prayer and 
fasting, which the heart makes holy. 

Whoso shall swear by the temple , &c. That is, he swears 
by God, who has His throne in the Temple, that He may be 
worshipped there. For the sacred majesty and holiness of God 
are supposed by men to abide in the Temple. Whence, S. 
Nilus says, “ Come to the church as to Heaven.” 

And he that sweareth by heaven , &c. For by the common usage 
and belief of men, he who swears by God, who only is infallible, 
and the uncreated Truth itself, calls Him to attest what he says 
or promises. Wherefore, he who swears by Heaven, swears by 
God, the King and Lord of Heaven, and calls Him to witness. 

Ver. 23. Woe unto you, &c. Tithes were sanctioned by God 
in the law. Whence R. Achiva says in Pirke Avoth, “ Tithes are 
the bulwark of riches,” because they defend and preserve them. 
“Tradition is the bulwark of the law. A vow is the bulwark of 
abstinence ; silence, of wisdom.”

Mint, a herb of sweet smell, which is often put into broth. 
Anise, says Pliny, is of efficacy against flatulency and p&ins

And ye have left , &c. . . . judgment , justice and equity, 
passing unjust sentences, so as to favour your own friends and 
those who offer you gifts. Afercy, because ye rigidly and cruelly 
exact tithes of widows and the poor. And fat thy i.e., fidelity in 
words and compacts. Or faith in God, and Christ who has 
been sent by Him. Therefore, ye are unbelievers, in that ye 
lack faith, hope, and charity, which are the things that God 
above all requires, according to the words in Micah vi. 8, “ I 
will show thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord 
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to 
walk humbly with thy God ? ” 

These are the things which ye ought to have done, and not 
to omit the others, such as the tithing of minty which was either 
commanded or permitted by the law. 

Ye blind guides which strain out, &c. ; Gr. divTJ^ovrtg, i.e., 
straining , purifying, draining wine, milk, or oil from gnats or 
other impurities or dregs, by means of a strainer of linen, or 
other such material As Apuleius says of the Gymnosophists, 
“They know not how either to cultivate land or to strain gold.” 
Swallow a camel \ For camel, Cajetan puts wrongly asilum , a 
gadfly , an insect which makes a horrid noise. All the codices, 
Greek, Latin, Syriac, and Arabic have camel, which is properly 
opposed to gnat, as something very large to something very 
small The sentence is proverbial, and means, “Ye have exact 
care of trifling things, such as tithing of herbs, lest any one should 
defraud you in the smallest possible degree ; but you at the same 
time commit, without any scruple, all manner of injustice, rapine, 
and other wickednesses, as big, as it were, as camels, which ye 
may be said to swallow down.” As it is said in Job xv. 16, 
“Who drinketh iniquity like water.” “Christ derides the seal 
of the Scribes,” says Origen, “in being so scrupulous about 
very trifling things, and so free and bold in the commission of

great crimes; in being superstitious about ceremonial washings, 
but devoid of true religion and charity.” They have those 
who are like them among Christians even now, who scrupu- 
lously recite the rosary, and fast in honour of the Blessed 
Virgin, and withal are guilty at the same time of luxury, rapine, 
theft, &c. 

Proverbs with a similar meaning are: “To draw water from 
a fountain to fill the sea.” “To strip one who is bare, to heap 
garments upon those who are clothed.” “He takes a candle 
to add to the sunlight.” “ To hunt a dog with a lion, a hare 
with an ox.” 

Mystically: S. Gregory understands by the gnat , Barabbas; by 
the camel , Christ. This is what he says (lib. i, Moral c. 6), 
“The gnat wounds in humming, but the camel of its own accord 
bends to receive its burden. The Jews, therefore, strained out 
the gnat, because they asked that the seditious robber might be 
set free. But they swallowed the camel , because by their cries 
they strove to destroy Him, who of His own will had come down 
to bear the burdens of our mortality.” 

Ver. 25. Woe unto you , &c. This is another parable, in which 
Christ calls man a cup and a plate. The body and external 
goods He calls the outside of the cup and the platter. The soul 
and the conscience He calls that which is within. The meaning 
is, “You, O ye Pharisees, studiously wash and cleanse your 
hands, your bodies, the cups and plates and glasses out of which 
ye eat and drink, but ye fill your conscience with the unclean- 
ness of rapine and every sort of wickedness. Whereas ye ought 
to take chief care that your conscience should be purified, for it 
is that alone which makes us clean in the sight of God, as it is 
also that from which flows all impurity of acts and deeds. It 
is the conscience which is the source of the goodness or wicked- 
ness of actions. Wherefore, if the conscience be clean, all other 
things will be clean also.” 

Briefly and simply we may explain thus: “Ye are zealous to 
cleanse the external cups and plates, out of which ye eat and

drink; ye neglect to cleanse by repentance the interior cups 
and dishes of the conscience, which are filthy with sin.” 

Full of uncleanness , Vulg. The translator had in his Greek 
text, axadape/ag, where we now read abtxiag, or axoaelag, i.e., in- 
temperance. It means, “Ye think ye are defiled, if ye drink out 
of a dirty cup ; but ye do not think ye are denied by intemper- 
ance, when ye are drunken. But it is intemperance which defiles 
the soul, not a dirty cup.” 

Thou blind Pharisee , &c. “O thou who art a teacher of 
others, and art blind thyself, cleanse first thine own mind and 
inward conscience, then shall all outward things become clean 
unto thee.” 

Vers. 27, 28. Woe unto you . . . full of iniquity ; Gr. atopic^ 
i.e., perversion of the law . “Ye simulate an outward zeal for 
the law, whilst inwardly ye despise and pervert it” Appositely 
says Auctor Imperfects \ “Tell me, O hypocrite, if it is good to 
be good, why do you not wish to be what you wish to appear? 
It is more base to be what it is base to appear: and what it is 
beautiful to appear, it is beautiful to be.” 

“Moreover, there are many in our days like the Pharisees," 
says S. Chrysostom, “who take the greatest care of cleanliness 
and outward adorning, but whose souls have no ornaments; 
yet who fill their souls with worms and gore and an inexpressible 
stench ; who fill them, I say, with wicked and absurd lusts.” 

Ver. 29. Woe unto you . . . because ye build ; Vulg. who build, 
the tombs , &c. For although this was in itself a holy and 
religious thing, yet in the Scribes it was vicious and wicked. 
S. Chrysostom gives three reasons — 1st He says Christ does 
not blame the work, but the intention. They did it for pomp. 
But as regards pomp, what does it profit them to be praised 
when they are not, and to be tormented when they are, in hell? 
2d. Because, without reason, he honours the just, who despises 
justice; and the Saints cannot be the friends of those to whom 
God is an enemy. 3d. Because the martyrs take no pleasure in 
being honoured with money which has caused the poor to weep.

ANECDOTE OF CAfcACALLA. 


45 


For the Scribes exacted money from the poor, that they might 
build with it magnificent monuments to the Prophets, or rather for 
their own glory. And a 4th, and principally, Christ here blames 
the Scribes for building monuments to the Prophets, because at 
the very time they did it, they were thinking how they might 
kill other and greater prophets, such as Christ Himself and His 
disciples. And this was why they seemed to imitate the murders 
and the sacrileges of their fathers, and to give an implied consent 
to them. As though He had said, “Ye bury the prophets who 
were slain by your fathers; and ye have a like desire to kill and 
bury Me. Rightly, therefore, do ye bury the Prophets whom 
your fathers slew; just as the sons of robbers bury those whom 
their fathers have murdered, that they may conceal the crime.” 
So Origen, S. Jerome, and others. 

By adding the word hypocrites , He intimates that they built 
the tombs of the Prophets, not from true, but merely pretended 
piety, that they might hide their own wickedness ; and that they 
might appear religious defenders of the law, and that it was 
out of zeal for righteousness that they persecuted Christ unto 
the death, as though He were a breaker and an enemy of the 
law. And herein was a twofold wickedness. First, the com- 
passing the death of Christ; secondly, hypocrisy, because of 
the pretence that they did it in order to vindicate the law. 
Somewhat similarly, when the Emperor Caracalla had slain his 
brother Geta upon his mother’s bosom, being persuaded by his 
servants to enrol his brother among the gods, with the object 
of veiling the crime, cried, “ Let him be a god if you please, 
so long as he is not alive.” Thus the Scribes did not wish 
Christ and the Prophets to live, lest they should reprove their 
evil deeds. They preferred to kill them, and to cover the 
crime by building them magnificent sepulchres. Wherefore, 
Auctor Impcrfccti says, “The Jews always held departed Saints 
in honour, and despised and persecuted living ones.” There are 
persons who act in a like manner among Christians even now. 

Ver. 30. And say , &c They deceive themselves, and utter

falsehoods. For if they killed Christ, the Prince of the Prophets, 
because He reproved their wickedness, surely they would have 
killed the Prophets, who were wont to do the same. 

Wherefore ye testify against yourselves , &c. That is, you testify 
that you are the sons of those who murdered the Prophets, and 
consequently that you have the same disposition and the same 
propensity to kill those who rebuke your vices, which they had. 
For children are like their parents. For a father is wont to 
transmit his inclinations, talents, and views to his children. 
Hence children “ favour their parents.” Also there is the example 
and training of parents, by means of which they influence their 
children to do the same things that they do themselves. 

Ver. 32. Fill ye up then ; Arab, ye fill up , &c. That is, by killing 
Me and the Apostles, as your fathers killed the Prophets. These 
words of Christ are not a command, but a prediction. It is as 
though He said, “ I do not command, but I permit and foretell 
that you, O ye Scribes, by killing Me, will fill up the measure of 
your fathers, who slew the Prophets ; and when this measure has 
been filled up, God will, at one and the same time, avenge both 
your own and your fathers’ crimes, by the extreme destruction 
which He will bring upon Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian.” 

From this and the 35 th and 36th verses Theologians teach that 
God has decreed to kingdoms and states and individuals a certain 
measure of sins, before He fully and perfectly punishes them. But 
by and by, when they have been completed, then He punishes all 
at the same time most fully. Thus Christ looked for the killing of 
Himself and His Apostles before Jerusalem was overthrown. So 9 
also, God said to Abraham (Gen. xv. 16), “The iniquity of the 
Amorites is not yet full.” Auctor Impetfecti says, God does not 
immediately punish a nation or a city when they sin, but waits 
for many generations, and sometimes threatens, and sometimes 
chastises in part, that the longer He waits the more just may be 
His judgment But when God does determine to destroy that city 
or nation, He seems to avenge upon them the sins of all the 
preceding generations; as though that generation alone suffered

WHY SINS VISITED ON CHILDREN. 


47 


what all the previous ones deserved. Thus God commanded Saul 
to blot out the posterity of Amalek on account of the wickedness 
of their parents, and their perpetual hostility to Israel (i Sam. 
xv. 16). The reason is, because children and descendants are 
counted as one with their parents ; hence the merits or demerits of 
the parents are imputed to the children, when, indeed, children 
imitate the wickedness and manners of their parents. Then, 
indeed, when the measure of sins predetermined by God is filled 
up, they suffer for their own and their fathers’ sins. 

Observe, however, that children are not punished more grievously 
than their own sins deserve, but because they imitate their parents’ 
sins, and fill up the measure of iniquity. Hence it comes to pass 
that the anger of God burns against them when it would not have 
so fiercely burned unless they had filled up that measure. And in 
this sense and for this reason children are said to have visited upon 
them the sins of their parents, because God, in punishing, looks to 
the offences of both, according to Deut v. 9, “A jealous God, 
rendering the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the 
third and fourth generation of them that hate Me.” 

Ver. 33. Ye serpents , &c. ... the damnation of hell, wherewith 
1 will condemn you in the day of judgment as Christicides and 
Deicides. He calls the Scribes serpents and vipers , because of their 
serpentine disposition, and wish to slay Himself and His Apostles. 

Ver. 34. Therefore , behold, \ I send, &c. Observe the word therefore, 
that it expresses from the preceding verse an effect, as it were, from 
a cause. It means, “because ye, as serpents and vipers, will kill 
Me, your Messiah, for which wickedness ye will be cut off and 
condemned to hell I have had pity upon you, and will send to 
you My disciples after My death, that they may avert from you this 
destruction, that they may arouse you to repentance and faith in 
Me. But I foresee that ye will slay them also, as I have predicted 
in the 33d verse.”

Apostles . S. Jerome says “This marks the various gifts of Christ’s 
disciples: Prophets , who foretell things to come; wise nun , who 
know when they ought to speak the word ; Scribes, those learned in 
the law.” 

Some of them ye shall kill , as S. Stephen by stoning, James the 
greater by the sword; and crucify , as S. Simeon, Bishop of 
Jerusalem, successor of S. James (see Euseb. H. E . ii. 32) ; and 
some of them ye shall scourge , as Peter and the Apostles (Acts iv. 
and v.), and persecute from city to city , like Paul and Barnabas 
(Acts xiii. and xiv.). 

Tropologically : Origen says (horn. 23, in Num .), “ And I, this day, 
if I will not hear the words of a Prophet, if I despise his warnings, 
stone that Prophet, and as far as in me lies, kill him.” 

Ver. 35. That upon you may come , &c., righteous blood. That is, 
of the righteous men who have exhorted others to live justly and 
holily, both by word and example. Whence S. Luke has, the blood 
of the Prophets ; for a Prophet in Scripture frequently denotes a just 
and holy man. S. Austin gives the reason for what Christ says in 
this verse, “ Because the imitation of wicked men causes people 
to obtain not only their own deserts, but the deserts of those whom 
they imitate.” Moreover S. Chrysostom says, “ Even as the 
rewards which all the preceding generations deserved were bestowed 
upon those who received Christ, so what their wicked ancestors 
merited came upon the latest Jews.” 

Which was shed, &c. Because, although Cain, who slew his 
brother Abel, was not a Jew by race, yet by his wickedness in 
killing righteous Abel he afforded an example to the Jews, who 
were most prone to follow it, in killing the holy Prophets. Thus 
Cain the fratricide was not the natural, but the symbolical father 
of the Jews who slew their brethren, Christ and the Prophets. By 
a like analogy the devil is called the father of all the proud and the 
wicked. 

The Jews, even though they knew the Divine vengeance which 
pursued Cain’s fratricide, not only imitated it, but far transcended 
it by slaying Christ, the Son of God, and His Apostles. We may

add, that although Cain was not a direct forefather of the Jews, he 
was one of their collateral ancestors. He was the brother of Seth, 
from whom Abraham and the Jews were sprung. But the posterity 
of Seth married the daughters of Cain, as Abulensis saith (Quast. 
260) (see Gen. vi. 2). This is probable, but not certain. All that 
Scripture says is, that from them the giants were sprung, who were 
the cause of the Deluge, in which they perished. But it does not 
say that other children were not sprung from them. 

There were persons who praised this fratricide of Cain, and for 
that reason were called Cainites, as S. Augustine says (lib, de harts, 
c. 18), “The Cainites are so called because they honour Cain, 
saying that he was a man of the greatest virtue.” They also think 
that the traitor Judas was something divine, and account his 
wickedness a benefit They assert that he knew beforehand how 
great a benefit the Passion of Christ would be to the human race, 
and for that reason betrayed Him to the Jews to be put to death. 
They are also said to honour the Sodomites, and those who made 
a schism amongst the ancient people, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 

Zacharias the son of Barachias. You will ask who was this 
Zacharias? There are three opinions. The first that of S. 
Chrysostom (Horn, de Joan. Bapt.), Vatablus, Arias Montanus, &c. 
They think that he was the Zachariah, the last but one of the 
twelve minor Prophets. For he was the son of Barachiah, but we 
nowhere read that he was slain between the Temple and the altar. 

The second and more probable opinion is, that he was the 
Zachariah who was the son of Jehoiada, who, with base ingratitude, 
was slain in an awfully sacrilegious manner by King Joash in the 
most holy place, — that is to say, in the court of the Priests, which 
was between the Temple, or the holy place, and the altar of burnt- 
offering; for this altar was in the court of the Priests (2 Chron. 
xxiv. 21). So Abul. ( Quasi . 215), S. Jerome, Bede, Tertullian 
(Scorpiace, c. 8), “Zachariah is slain between the Temple and the 
altar, marking the stones with indelible spots of blood.” For 
although there were other Prophets slain by the Jews after 

Zachariah, he is the last whose murder is related in Scripture, 
vou in. d

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIII. 


Add to this that Scripture makes mention only of the blood of 
Abel and this Zacharias as crying for vengeance. Of Abel’s it is 
said (Gen. iv. io), “What hast thou done? The voice of thy 
brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground.” And of 
Zacharias (2 Chron. xxiv. 22), “Who, when he was dying, said, 
‘The Lord look upon it, and require it.’” Chrysostom says, “ He 
makes mention of Abel to show that they would kill Christ and 
His Apostles out of envy, as from envy Cain slew Abel; of 
Zacharias, because the holy man was slain in the holy place.” 

You will say, this Zacharias was the son of Jehoiada, not of 
Barachias. S. Jerome answers that Jehoiada was also called 
Barachiah, perhaps because Barachiah in Hebrew signifies “the 
blessed of the Lord.” And it is plain that Jehoiada, who was a 
very holy man, was such. S. Jerome adds, “ In the Gospel which 
the Nazarenes make use of, we find, instead of the son of Barachias, 
the son of Jehoiada.” 

The third opinion is, that this Zacharias was the father of John 
the Baptist, concerning whom there is a tradition that he was slain 
by the Jews because he proclaimed the advent of Christ, saying in 
his Canticle, “ And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the 
Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare 
His ways and because he had hidden his son John from Herod, 
the murderer of the innocents, who sought to kill him on account 
of the miracles which happened at his birth. For this Zacharias was 
the last of the Prophets. For John, his son, was rather an index to 
a present Christ than a Prophet of a future one. Again, that this 
Zacharias was the son of Barachias is attested by S. Hippolytus, 
the martyr, who is cited by Nicephorus (H. E. ii. 3). S. Jerome 
rejects this as apocryphal; but the same thing is asserted by S. 
Cyril, against the Anthropomorphites, Peter of Alexandria (in regula 
Eccles . can. 3), S. Epiphanius (lib. de vit. et obit. Prophet.), Baronius 
(in apparat. Ann.), S. Thomas (in Catena). Origen, Theophylact, 
Euthymius, and S. Basil (Horn, de humana Christi general .) add 
that this Zacharias was slain by the Jews because, after the birth of 
Christ, he placed the Blessed Virgin as a virgin among the virgins

and benefits, — the law, the Temple, priesthood, doctrine, enriched 
with a kingdom, Prophets, miracles, — thou hast always been un- 
grateful for all these things. Thou hast slain the Prophets, and 
joon thou wilt kill Me and My Apostles. Wherefore thou hast 
become a wicked and lost city, destined by God to be destroyed 
and burnt by the Romans.” By city , the inhabitants, especially the 
Priests and magistrates, who chiefly were guilty of the blood of the 
Prophets, are meant 

That killest the prophets. S. Luke says that Christ added, it 
cannot be that a Prophet perish out oj Jerusalem; it was the 
appropriate work of Jerusalem to kill the Prophets. 

How often have I wished , formerly by the Prophets, and now by 
Myself and the Apostles, to gather into My bosom, to bring back 
to the one God and the one faith, thy sons % — that is, thy citizens, 
who are scattered unto various errors, and are hurling themselves 
into the perils of Gehenna. For nothing disperses like sin, and 
nothing so gathers us to God as virtue, says Theophylact 

As a hen gathereth her chickens , wandering in different directions, 
under her wings , to cherish and warm them, and defend them from 
the hawk. 

Christ compares Himself, and His love and solicitude to save 
the Jews, to a hen cherishing her chickens under her wings. First, 
because hens love their young ones above all other birds, and 
manifest the greatest care and protection over them, says S. 
Chrysostom. Thus a hen calls and clucks, so that even if she 
cannot see her chickens , they may recognise their mother by hei

call. Whilst sparrows, swallows, storks, are only recognised by the 
parent birds whilst they are in their nests. Christ has loved us with 
supremest love, “ being made Himself,” says S. Hilary, “ as it were, 
an earthly and domestic bird, being anxiously solicitous for us all 
through His life, teaching, sighing, and groaning, in order that 
He might save us.” 

2. Neither sparrows, nor thrushes, nor ducks, nor any other birds 
become so weak when they have young as the hen does, whose voice 
“becomes hoarse,” says S. Augustine (in Ps . 59): “the whole body 
becomes neglected, the wings droop, the feathers become loose, 
and all this is the effect of maternal love. Thus Christ gathered 
all nations, like a hen her chickens, Who became weak for our 
sakes, receiving flesh from us, that is, from human nature, was 
crucified, despised, slapped with the hand, beaten, hung on the 
cross, wounded with a lance. Therefore this is of maternal infir- 
mity, not loss of majesty, that inasmuch as He shared with us in 
our infirmity, He might release us from our sins.” 

3. The same Augustine says on the words in the 91st Psalm, 
“Thou shalt be safe under his feathers,” “If a hen protects her 
young ones under wings, how much rather shalt thou be safe under 
the wings of God, against the devil and his angels, who fly round 
about like hawks, that they may carry off the young chickens.” 

4. The word in the Greek for hen is lou^ which is a generic 
name for any bird, but the Vulg. does well to translate it by 
gallina , a hen. For, as S. Augustine says, it is wonderful what 
love almost all birds, but especially the hen, show in cherishing 
and protecting their young. 

5. A hen with a branch of rue under her wings, says Pierias, is 
the hieroglyphic of security. Afranius, in the particulars which 
Constantine ordered to be collected about agriculture, says that 
hens will be safe from the cat if a little bunch of wild rue be 
tied under one of their wings. Democritus says further, that 
the same herb will protect them from foxes, and from every 
other hostile animal. Such security, only in a far higher degree, 
does Christ afford to His people.

MYSTICAL MEANINGS OF HEN. 


53 


6. A hen is the symbol of fruitfulness. It often lays an egg a 
day, and sometimes two in a day. And one egg occasionally 
produces two chickens. What is more fruitful than Christ ? 

Again, a cock and a hen are the symbol of watchfulness and 
guardianship. What is more watchful than Christ ? 

Tropologieally : a hen is the Church and her Priests. For, as 
Audor Imperfecti says, “ As a hen that hath young ones does not 
cease to call them, but with assiduous clucking checks their stray- 
ing away ; so also ought Priests not to cease by their teaching and 
zeal to correct the negligence of an erring people. And as a hen 
that hath chickens not only warns her own young ones, but even 
loves as her own the young of any bird excluded from those to 
whom they belong ; so likewise does the Church not only study to 
call her own Christians, but Gentiles and Jews also, if they be 
brought to her; she quickens them all with the warmth of her 
faith. She regenerates them in baptism, she nourishes them by 
preaching, and she loves them with maternal charity.” 

7. There exists the figure of a hen with the motto, “ Where Christ 
has been received, there is nothing sad.” Also, 

8. The eggs of hens are said to be useful in various complaints, 
such as pains in the eyes and gout So likewise is Christ the best 
Physician of all the infirmities of souls. 

9. When a hen is in any peril which threatens herself alone, as 
from a kite, or a cat or dog, she flees. But if she fears danger for 
her young ones, she gathers them under her wings, and strives to 
protect them by every means in her power. She will often fight 
for them with her wings, her beak, and her whole body. So Christ 
fought for us against the devil and sin unto death, even the death 
of the cross. 

And ye would not : because ye will pursue Me with hatred even 
unto death, and will not suffer your citizens to be converted unto 
Me and your God. This, as I have already observed, is especially 
addressed to the Scribes and rulers. 

Ver. 38. Behold your house 9 &c. That is, the Temple, says S. 
Jerome and Theophylact ; but more correctly, the city of Jerusalem

and the whole region of Judea, which, as the punishment of such 
black ingratitude, was to be laid waste by the Romans, under Titus, 
There is an allusion to Jer. xii. 7, “ I have left my house, I have 
forsaken my inheritance.” For when Jerusalem was forsaken by 
God, it became the synagogue of Satan, and so the prey of the 
Roman eagles under Titus and Vespasian, who partly slew the 
Jews, partly led them away captive, and partly scattered them 
over the whole world. 

For I say unto you , &c. u I will withdraw Myself from you into 
Heaven ; and ye shall see Me no more upon earth, until the Day of 
Judgment, when I will condemn your unbelief.” Some take this 
verse to refer to Christ's solemn entry into Jerusalem on Palm 
Sunday, when the Jews cried aloud to Him, Hosanna , , Blessed is 
He that eometh in the name of the Lord \ But this is clearly an 
erroneous opinion, for this triumphal entry was already past, as 
is plain from chap. xxi. 1, &c. These words were spoken by Christ 
after Palm Sunday, three days before His crucifixion. So the 
Fathers and Commentators, passim . 

I say then that Christ is here speaking concerning the end of 
the world and the Day of Judgment This is the opinion of S. 
Chrysostom, Theophylact, S. Augustine (de consens . Evang. lib . 2, 
cap . 75)- As though He had said, “You, O ye Scribes, who con- 
stantly contradict and calumniate Me, saying that I am not the 
Messiah, but that I cast out devils by Beelzebub, shall not see Me 
from by and by , that is, after the few days before My death, in which 
I shall be conversant among you, until the Judgment Day, when 
ye shall be compelled, even against your will, to acknowledge Me 
as Messiah, the Son of God, and your Judge as well as the Judge 
of all men ; and to cry Hosanna, if not with your outward lips, at 
least in your hearts and minds, though against your will. Then 
shall ye see that I was, and am Blessed, I who came in the Name 
of the Lord, inasmuch as I was sent by God the Father to redeem 
and save all mankind, then, I say, when ye ought to have wor- 
shipped and adored Me.” 

Secondly, it is possible that this passage may be understood of

the Jews, who about the end of the world shall be converted to 
Christ by the preaching of Elias, and who, when He shall presently 
come to judgment, will acknowledge Him to be Messiah, the Blessed 
of the Lord. As though He said, “ You, O ye Jews, do not wish to 
acknowledge Me as Messiah, and persecute Me as a false Christ, 
even unto death ; but your posterity in the end of the world will 
acknowledge and worship Me. On them, therefore, I will bestow 
My grace and glory, but you I will condemn to everlasting punish- 
ment. And, this will be to my praise and honour and glory, but 
to your shame and everlasting contempt.” Thus does Christ prick 
the hard and unbelieving hearts of the Jews. This was prophesied 
by Osee iii. 4, &c., to which Christ here makes allusion.

CHAPTER XXIV. 

I Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple : 3 what and hem gnat calamities 
shall he before it: 29 the signs of His coming to judgment, 36 And because 
that day and hour is unknown , 42 we ought to watch like good servants , 
expecting every moment our master’s coming. 

A ND Jesus went out, and departed from the temple : and his disciples came 
***■ to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. 

2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto 
you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be 
thrown down. 

3 IT And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him 
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the 
sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world ? 

4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive 
you. 

5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ ; and shall deceive 
many. 

6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : 
for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet 

7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom : and 
there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 

8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 

9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you : and ye 
shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. 

10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall 
hate one another. 

1 1 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 

12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 

13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 

14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a 
witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come. 

15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of 
by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth, let him under- 
stand):

THE HOLY GOSPEL OF S. MATTHEW.

16 Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains : 

17 Let him which is on the house-top not come down to take any thing out of 
his house : 

18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. 

19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in 
those days 1 

20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath 
day: 

21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning 
of the worlds to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 

22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be 
saved : but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. 

23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there ; believe 
it not. 

24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great 
signs and wonders ; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the 
very elect. 

25 Behold, I have told you before. 

26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert ; go not 
forth : behold, he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not. 

27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the 
west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 

28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. 

29 IT Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, 
and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and 
the powers of the heavens shall be shaken : 

30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then 
shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming 
in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 

31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they 
shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to 
the other. 

32 Now learn a parable of the fig-tree 5 When his branch is yet tender, and 
putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh : 

33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, 
even at the doors. 

34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things 
be fulfilled. 

35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. 

36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, 
but my Father only. 

37 But as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 

38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drink- 
ing, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the 
ark, 

39 And knew not, until the flood came and took them all away; so shall 
also the coming of the Son of man be. 

40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other 
left.

58 S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 

41 Two women shall he grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken, and the 
other left. 

42 Watch therefore ; for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 

43 But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in what 
watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have 
suffered his house to be broken up. 

44 Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of 
man cometh. 

45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler 
over his household, to give them meat in due season ? 

46 Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so 
doing. 

47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. 

48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his 
coming ; 

49 And shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the 
drunken ; 

50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, 
and in an hour that he is not aware of. 

51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypo- 
crites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

And Jesus went out \ & c., according to His custom at eventide, 
to the Mount of Olives, to pass the night, and partake of food at 
Bethany, in the house of Martha and Mary, after He had been 
teaching all day without food in the Temple. 

And His disciples , &c. The occasion was because Christ, at the 
end of the preceding chapter, had predicted the destruction o; 
Jerusalem, and consequently of the Temple. The disciples there- 
fore, being amazed at this desolation of so great a city, show Him 
the wonderful fabric of the Temple, its beauty and magnificence, 
which seemed worthy of lasting for ever, in order that they might 
move Christ to pity, and to revoke the sentence of destruction. 
For this Temple was the wonder of the world, as Josephus says (de 
Bello Jud. vi. 6), “ Its exterior had everything for the mind and the 
eye to admire. The roof was entirely covered with very heavy gold 
plates. At sunrise it was seen from afar with such a fiery splendour 
as to dazzle the eyes of beholders, as though they were gazing at 
the sun itself.” See S. Hilary, “After Christ had threatened the 
destruction of Jerusalem, they show Him the magnificence of its 
construction, as if He could be moved by the desire of it” So, top,

BEAUTY OF THE TEMPLE.

Origen, S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, Jansen, and others. But 
none of this magnificence moved Christ to recall His sentence. 
In like manner God overthrew all the magnificence of Babylon, 
Nineveh, Antioch, and Rome, as well on account of the wickedness 
of their inhabitants, as that He might show that all such splendour 
is transitory, and of little worth, that so He might draw the minds 
of men to regard and desire the magnificence of Heaven, which is 
far greater, as well as eternal 

Truly and piously saith S. Augustine, “ He will not be a great 
man who thinks it much that wood and stone should fall and 
mortals die.” Such were the thoughts with which S. Austin was 
wont to comfort himself, when Hippo, the city of which he was 
bishop, was besieged by the Vandals, and which was taken by 
them and burnt after his death. 

But Jesus said, & c. One stone shall not be left upon another \ 
This is a hyperbole, meaning, there shall be utter and total destruc- 
tioa The Romans did not spend so much time upon the destruc- 
tion of Jerusalem and its Temple as not to leave a stone upon a 
stone ; but yet it was burnt by them, and destroyed in so effectual 
a manner, that it was razed to the ground, and a plough caused to 
pass over its site, as S. Jerome testifies on Zech. viii., and Josephus. 
And this is what Christ here indicates. 

Listen to Josephus (/. 7, Bell \ c. 18), “Titus bid them utterly 
destroy the city and the Temple. But there was left standing the 
three towers, Hippicus, Phaseius, and Mariamne, and that part of 
the wall of the city which defended it on the west This was done 
for the sake of the garrison which he left. And the towers were 
allowed to stand, in order to be a witness to posterity how strongly 
fortified was the city which the valour of the Romans had captured. 
But the remainder of the fortifications they so completely levelled 
with the ground, that persons who approached would scarcely have 
believed that the city had ever been inhabited.” 

And as He sat, &c. Disciples : Mark speaks of four, viz., Peter, 
James, John, and Andrew, who were on more intimate terms with 
Christ, and admitted to His secrets. Privately, apart not only from

the multitude, but from the rest of the Apostles. The Syriac has, 
between themselves and Him . For it was a matter full of danger to 
prophesy, indeed even to speak about, the destruction of the Temple, 
on account of the Scribes and the Magistrates. It was on account 
of this that the Jews stoned S. Stephen. This is plain from Acts 
vL 14. 

Tell us: the Disciples here ask two things; the first, that Christ 
would tell them when Jerusalem was to be destroyed ; the second, 
when the destruction of the world and the Day of Judgment would 
be, when He should come to judge all men. The Disciples thought 
that Jerusalem and the Temple would be destroyed at the glorious 
Advent and reign of Christ at the end of the world, as if He were 
about to destroy them in punishment and vengeance for His death. 
For they supposed that these three things, namely, the destruction 
of the city, the end of the world, and the Day of Judgment would 
all take place at the same time. And as they knew from the words 
of Christ that the destruction of the city was nigh at hand, they 
thought that the end of the world and the Day of Judgment was 
also at hand. They seemed to come to this conclusion from the 
words of Christ (Matt xxii. 7, 8, and xxiiL 5), where He seems to 
join all those events together, and speak of them unitedly. 

Let no man seduce you (Vulgate), i.e., from faith in Me and My 
Gospel. 

For many shall come , &c. Such were, 1. that Theudas, of whom 
in Acts v. 36. a. That Egyptian impostor, of whom Josephus (L a, 
Bell, cap . 12) and Acts xxi. 38. 3. Simon Magus, of whom Acts 
viii. 10, who, as S. Jerome asserts, was wont to say, “ I am the word 
of God : I am beautiful : I am the Paraclete : I am Almighty : I 
am all in all.” For this Simon, as Irenaeus testifies (lib. 1, c. ao), 
used to say that he had appeared in Judea as the Son, in Samaria 
as the Father, and had come down among the Gentiles as the Holy 
Ghost Thus this proud Titan, as it were another Lucifer, was wont 
to say that he was not only Messiah, or Christ, but the whole Blessed 
Trinity. He it was who, by his magic spectres, so deluded Nero 
and the Romans, that a statue was erected to him at Rome, between

‘two bridges, with this inscription, To Simon, a great god, 4. Such 
were Menander, Satuminus, the Gnostics, and the rest who sprang 
from the family of Simon. Lastly, such will be Antichrist, who will 
proclaim himself to the Jews to be Christ, according to the words 
of the Lord in John v. 43, “If another shall come in his own name, 
him ye will receive,” which every one understands of Antichrist, as 
S. Augustine says (Serm. 45, de Verb . Bom.). 

When ye shall hear of wars , &c Rumours: Gr. dxodc, reports ; 
Arab, news, which are often more miserable than the battles 
themselves, and more thoroughly torment the mind with the fear 
of evils to come, even though they do not come Here is another 
sign given by Christ, prior to the destruction of the city and the 
world, viz., tumults, wars, seditions, &c. Josephus shows that such 
took place before the destruction of Jerusalem (lib. 2, de Bello, cap . 
11). As S. Chrysostom says, 44 He declares there shall be a twofold 
war, one by the seducers, the other by the enemies.” 

Take heed, &c That through fear of the enemy ye do not depart 
from My faith, or by despairing of fruit give up preaching the 
Gospel; but with generous minds struggling against fear and all 
opposition, go forward and proclaim faith in Me and My Gospel 
He adds the reason why the Apostles must not be troubled, saying, 

For all those things must be. The Greek has all, which the Vul- 
gate omits. But the end is not yet, the end of Jerusalem and the 
Temple, much less of the world, also of the battles and evils prior 
to the destruction of both. For the end of any one battle or 
trouble will be but the beginning of some greater one, as Josephus 
says happened at the siege of Jerusalem. Be not troubled, or lose 
confidence, but have greater courage, that ye may be prepared for 
the greater evils which shall follow, so as to sustain and overcome 
them. Do not hope for peace on earth, but by bearing troubles 
here, pass on to the eternal and happy rest of Heaven. 

For nations shall rise, &c. For, as S. Jerome and Bede observe, 
and S. Augustine (Epist. 80, ad Hesych.), Christ answers His Apostles, 
who were asking in a confused manner about the destruction of 
the city and the world, mingling the two events together, after the

same way that they asked. This He does as far as the 15th 
verse. And He did it with this object, that the Apostles and 
the faithful might always be in suspense, and so carefully prepare 
and fortify themselves for both events. From the 15th verse He 
treats expressly of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the signs 
which should precede it, up to the 29th verse. After that, up to 
the end of the chapter, He speaks of the signs which shall pre- 
cede the end of the world. Now that He is speaking both of the 
destruction of the city and the world in this verse, and as far as 
the 15th, is manifest from the signs themselves, which were to pre- 
cede both. Therefore S. Hilary and S. Gregory (Horn. 1, in Evang .), 
and Irenaeus (/. 5, c. 25), understand them of the destruction of the 
world. For it shall be preceded by the most dreadful tumults, 
battles, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, false Christs. Again S. 
Chrysostom, Euthymius, Theophylact, rightly understand them of 
the destruction of Jerusalem. This is plain from S. Luke xxi. 8, 12, 
“ But before all these things they shall lay their hands upon you, and 
persecute you, bringing you into the synagogues .” Which happened to 
the Apostles before the destruction of Jerusalem, as we learn from 
the Acts of the Apostles. Before that event, 1. " nation rose up 
against nation.” After the Jews had captured and slaughtered the 
Roman garrison of Jerusalem, almost immediately the inhabitants 
of Ascalon, Ptolemais, Damascus, Alexandria, the Syrians, Romans, 
and all the neighbouring nations rose up against them. And this 
state of things continued until the most miserable destruction of 
Jerusalem. See Josephus, Bell. Jud. passim . 

2. That Judaea was afflicted with famine before the destruction of 
the capital, is plain from Acts xi. 28. 

3. Although Josephus says nothing about pestilences or earth- 
quakes, yet it is certain from this prophecy of Christ that they must 
have happened. And both are usual concomitants of war and 
famine. 

S. Luke adds, ** fearful sights and great signs shall there be from 
Heaven ” That these shall precede the destruction of the world is 
plain from Apoc. chaps, viii. and ix. It is equally certain that they

preceded the destruction of Jerusalem. For, 1. a dreadful comet, 
in the shape of a sword, hung over Jerusalem a whole year before 
its destruction. 2. At the Passover, when the people were gathered 
together, three hours after midnight, a light as bright as noon-day 
shone for half an hour in the Temple. 3. A bullock that was 
about to be offered in sacrifice brought forth a lamb. 4. The 
eastern gate of the Temple, made of brass, and so heavy that it 
could be with difficulty closed by twenty men, opened of its own 
accord at the hour of midnight 5. There was seen in the air 
the appearances of armies, chariots, and battles. 6. There was 
heard at Pentecost the voices of angels, saying in the Temple, 
“ Let us depart hence.” 7. An ignorant man of the lower orders, 
Jesus the son of Ananus, began suddenly to cry aloud, “ A voice 
from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a 
voice against Jerusalem and the Temple, a voice against the bride- 
grooms and the brides, a voice against the whole people.” And 
this he continued to cry night and day without ceasing, perambulat- 
ing all the streets of the city. This he did for seven years, crying 
with a dreadful voice, like one astonied, " Woe, woe to Jerusalem,” 
until at last, when the city was besieged by Titus, as he was crying 
upon the wall with a louder voice than usual, “ Woe to Jerusalem, 
to the Temple, to the people, and to myself,” he was struck by a 
stone hurled from one of the military engines of the besiegers, and 
killed. For all these things, see Josephus, Bell. 7. 12, and Eusebius, 
H. E. iii. 8. 

Ver. 8. All these . . . of sorrows ; Gr. parturition pangs, 

as S. Jerome renders in his comment. That is to say, the greatest 
possible pains, such as women suffer in childbirth, and from which 
many die. For like as it is in people about to die, disease and 
pain increase gradually until the time of death ; so did wars, 
famine, pestilence increase until the final destruction of Jerusalem, 
as we know from Josephus. Thus also shall it be before the end 
of the world. Says S. Ambrose, “ Because we are in the last times, 
diseases of the world shall go before ” (in Luc \ xxi. 9).

The Syriac puts hate first, because hate begets oppression. “ They 
shall torment and afflict you with various torments. You will seem 
to be given up and dedicated to tribulation. All nations in all 
places shall persecute you as revilers of their gods, and as 
preachers of a new God, Christ crucified.” This was fulfilled 
under Nero, who raised the first persecution, and slew the princes 
of the Apostles, S. Peter by the cross, S. Paul by the sword, and 
burnt alive in the circus many Christians, smearing them with 
grease and pitch, and setting them on fire, so that they acted the 
part of lamps to give light during the night. (Tac. Ann. I 15.) 
Antichrist will do yet more horrible things before the end of the 
world.

And shall deliver one another up (Vulg.); Syr. and English, 
shall betray one another. Apostates and other heathen, to curry 
favour with the emperors and princes, shall betray their Christian 
friends and relations. This is now the case in England, Scotland, 
and Japan. Such are false brethren, of whom S. Paul complains, 
2 Cor. xi. 26. “You see,” says S. Chrysostom, “there shall be a 
triple war, one by enemies, a second by seducers, a third by false 
brethren.” 

And many false prophets— false teachers , heresiarchs , such as 
Simon Magus, Menander, Arius, Luther, and Antichrist the head 
of them all. Shall seduce many (Vulg.), not by the strength of the 
seducers, but by the negligence of the seduced. Thus S. Paul 
foretold, Acts xx. 29, 30, “ For I know this, that after my depart- 
ing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the 
flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking per- 
verse things, to draw away disciples after them.”

that is to say, infidelity, heresy, persecution, tyranny, and every 
kind of impurity, the love of many shall grow cold ; Syr. shall 
languish; Arab, shall be diminished. It means, that they who 
aforetime were warm with love to Christ and Christians, when they 
see so many persecutions and afflictions of Christians, will cease 
to be warm. Yea, they will grow cold. Their love will be turned 
into hatred and disgust. Christ foretells all these things that He 
may strengthen believers against all hardships and trials, and make 
them firm as an adamantine rock. 

But he that shall endure , viz., in the faith and love of Christ, 
unto the end: both of tribulation, and persecution, and of life, and 
who is of invincible patience, so as to yield to no terrors, or 
blandishments, or torments, shall be saved. The one only remedy 
and triumph over all these evils is a generous constancy and per- 
severance in faith and charity. For he who endures all these 
things is he who conquers and overcomes, as appears by the 
Apostles, S. Laurence, S. Vincent, S. Sebastian, and the rest 
of the martyrs. Therefore this saying should be adopted by 
a believer, "Yield not to calamities, but advance boldly against 
them.” 

Ver. 14. And this Gospel , &c. This was fulfilled before the de- 
struction of Jerusalem, for a witness unto all nations. For thereby 
God testified unto all nations His love towards the Jews, and 
their perfidy to Christ. And the calling of the Gentiles for that 
reason into their place, and this election of the Gentiles in place 
of the Jews, was just, as S. Chrysostom proves from Rom. i. 8, 
“Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world 5” and 
“Their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words unto 
the ends of the world.” And from Col. i. 6, "Which (Gospel) is 
come unto you, and beareth fruit in you, as it doth in all the 
world.” 

But this must be understood hyperbolically, meaning, that before 
the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, the Gospel was promulgated 
in the greatest number and chief countries and provinces of the 

world, not in every small and remote spot. Wherefore S. Jerome, 

vou ill. E

Bede, and other Fathers teach that this will clearly and fully take 
place before the end of the world. “The end ” must here be 
taken absolutely ; and before the end of the world the Gospel will 
be preached throughout the whole world, so that Churches will 
be founded among all nations, and dioceses and bishops created. 
This it is allowed did not take place before the destruction of 
Jerusalem. And all this shall be done for a witness , or testimony 
to all nations \ God will thereby make known unto all nations 
His loving Providence, in that He hath shut out no nation, 
however barbarous and impious, from faith in Christ, from grace 
and salvation, but hath loved all, and cared for all, and hath 
called them at suitable times, and therefore hath omitted nothing 
which is needful for the salvation of all nations. And likewise, in 
the day of judgment, He will condemn all nations, who have refused 
to believe in Him, and obey Him. 

From this prophecy of Christ, S. Jerome, Suarez, and others 
teach that this will be a sure sign of the near approach of the 
end of the world, namely, the preaching of the Gospel throughout 
the whole world in such a manner, that the Church shall be 
founded everywhere, and shall have everywhere Christian members, 
clergy, temples, Priests. And although Maldonatus and Franc. 
Lucas deny this as to its full extent, as being in this place 
certainly declared by Christ, yet it is absolutely true, thus far, 
that the Church shall be founded in all nations, and will for 
some time before the end be established amongst them. But for 
how long a time is uncertain, and known only to God. 

Moreover, because we see that about 150 years ago, a new 
world, America, was discovered by the Spaniards, and that 
Christopher Columbus and Vespucci sailed to and opened out 
the West Indies, which constitute half the globe, and that the 
Gospel has been propagated in almost every portion of this new 
world, we may gather from hence that we are sensibly coming near 
to the end of the world. For of the rest of the globe, no part 
remains which has not, at some time or other, received the 
faith of Christ, except perhaps China. And even there Nicolas

ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION.

Trigaltius shows by certain proofs {Lib. de Fide in China pro* 
pagata) there were formerly Christians and Christian Churches. 
The same thing is proved by the inscription upon a stone which 
has lately been discovered in China, which plainly testifies that 
the Gospel was preached there by Apostolic men. 

Ver. 15. When therefore . . . the abomination of desolation^ i.e., the 
abominable desolation; Syr. the unclean portent of destruction. What 
this was I have explained at length on Dan. ix. 27. Some under- 
stand by it an idol placed in the Temple ; others, Antichrist himself, 
who will desire to be worshipped in the Temple as God ; others, 
more correctly, the Roman armies which besieged Jerusalem, and 
which, shortly afterwards, when it had been captured, fearfully 
wasted it, and made it desolate. The profanation of the Temple 
by the murders and other crimes which were perpetrated in it by 
the seditious and wicked Jews, who called themselves Zealots of 
the law and of liberty, may also be intended. 

Thus far Christ has given His Apostles signs in common, which 
were to precede both the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of 
the world. He now goes on to give special signs which were to 
precede the siege of Jerusalem by Titus. Wherefore Christ warns 
Jews and Christians alike, when they beheld these signs, to flee 
immediately to the mountains — not of Judaea, for they were 
occupied by Roman soldiers (Jos. Bell. 1 . 3. c. 12, and /. 4. c. 2), 
but those beyond Judaea, that they might thus escape the ap- 
proaching overthrow of the city. In this way the Christians, 
mindful of this prediction of Christ, and warned by a Divine 
orac’.e (Eus. H. E /. 3. c. 15), fled across the Jordan, to a city 
named Pella (S. Epiphan. Hares. 29 and 30), and even carried 
their property thither, as well as the episcopal Chair of S. James. 
Eusebius says that this Chair was preserved down to his own time 
(H. E. 7. 15). If this Chair had remained at Jerusalem, it must 
have been burnt with everything else. In these events we may 
see the singular providence of God over Christians, and His 
anger against the Jews. For, when the Roman army came, the 
Jews and Galileans fled in crowds to Jerusalem, as to a place

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


of refuge, thinking that there they would be safe. But God 
gathered them together there that they might be killed by the 
Romans. 

Let him which is on the house-top — for the Jewish roofs were flat, 
so that they could walk and sleep upon them — not come down , but 
flee suddenly, so that he may save his life, and lose everything else. 
For so great and so sudden shall be this destruction of Judaea and 
Jerusalem by the Romans, that it were better for a man to flee 
away naked, than, by wishing to save his goods, to expose himself to 
danger. The sentence is hyperbolical, signifying how swiftly men 
ought to fly from the fearful impending calamity. Thus, “ Let him 
that is on the house-top not come down gradually by means of 
ladders, but let him descend by one leap, or let himself down, 
very swiftly by a rope, that he may escape the coming destruction.” 
For, hyperbole apart, the Jews had some little time given them to 
escape. In the first place, Cestius Gallus, who was sent by Nero^ 
besieged Jerusalem, but he was routed by the Jews, and put to flight. 
Six months afterwards, Vespasian was sent by the same emperor, 
Nero. He subdued Galilee, and stormed all the other Jewish cities 
except Jerusalem. In this work he spent three years. When he 
was preparing for the siege of Jerusalem, tidings came to him of the 
death, of Nero. Then Vespasian was proclaimed emperor by the 
army, and returned to Rome, to take charge of the State, commit- 
ting the conclusion of the war to his son Titus, who, after half a 
year, besieged Jerusalem at the time of the Passover, and took it in 
six months, and burnt and destroyed it This half-year, in which 
the Romans carried on the war less vigorously, was spent by the 
Jews in internecine strife. For, first, the Zealots seized the Temple, 
filling it with the murdered corpses of their fellow-citizens. To the 
Zealots succeeded Simon of Gerasa, the head of a new sedition. 
Being sent by the people into Jerusalem to restrain the Zealots, he 
turned his hand in slaughter and rapine against the citizens. There 
was then sufficient space after the approach of the Roman armies 
for the Jews to save their goods and flee; but Christ advises 
immediate flight, as well to signify how dreadful the calamity would

be, as well as because, when the Roman armies were once in 
Judaea, and spreading themselves over the land, there would be 
no safe place to flee unto. For the fugitives constantly fell into 
the hands of the Roman soldiers, by whom they were despoiled 
and slaughtered, as Josephus relates at length in the history of 
the Jewish wars. 

This most dreadful destruction of Jerusalem was an express type 
and prelude of the end of the world, just as were Noah’s deluge, 
the burning of Sodom, and the drowning of Pharaoh and his host 
in the Red Sea. 

Mystically: Pope Adrian I., in his Epistle to Charles, King of 
France, says, “He upon the house-top is he who, leaving carnal 
things, lives spiritually, as it were, in a free atmosphere. This 
man’s furniture lies idle in the house, because with his mind rising 
above the body, by the force of his understanding being, as it were, 
placed upon the house-top, he enjoys through the perspicuity of his 
wisdom an unbroken view, as it were, of heaven.” 

He that is in the field . . . clothes ; Gr. //aar/or, *>., cloak or outer 
garment For men who labour in the fields are wont to leave their 
upper garments at home, so as to be able to work more expedi- 
tiously. In like manner, when the destruction of Jerusalem is 
impending, flee away swiftly, and half-naked, if you are so at the 
time, that you may escape the great and terrible slaughter. The 
expression is hyperbolical, and similar to the one in the previous 
verse. Both signify that they were to leave everything, even their 
clothes, and flee away as swiftly as possible, for so the greatness 
of the calamity is intimated. The prophets make use of a similar 
expression under similar circumstances. Thus Jeremiah, in the 
slaughter of the Egyptians by the Chaldeans (xlvi. 5), “ Wherefore 
have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? And their 
mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not 
back : for fear was round about, saith the Lord” *

burden of their children would hinder their flight, so that they 
would be taken and slain by the savage Roman soldiers, together 
with their little ones. So S. Chrysostom and others. Theophylact 
adds that there is a further allusion to the severity of the famine, 
by reason of which some women were constrained to devour their 
infants in the siege of Jerusalem. As Josephus testifies (Bell. 7. 8), 
Christ declares the fearfulness of the vengeance and destruction 
of Jerusalem, that even women with child and infants would not 
be spared, as is customary in the siege and capture of other cities. 

But pray ye, &c. In winter; because flight is difficult, on account 
of the cold, snow, rain, and tempests. For this reason flight is 
then impossible to the sick and aged. Or, if attempted, it ends in 
death. On the Sabbath: because then it was not lawful for the 
Jews to walk more than about 700 paces, as I have shown in 
Acts i. 12. 

You will say that the Sabbath, as well as other ordinances of the 
Law, had been already abrogated by Christ when Jerusalem was 
destroyed by Titus; and even if they had not been abrogated, it 
would have been allowed by the law of nature that persons should 
go many miles to save their lives. 

I answer: Christ is speaking of Jews, and Christians who still 
judaized, who were wont to observe the Sabbath with such over- 
scrupulosity, that they preferred to die rather than flee or defend 
themselves against the attacks of their enemies upon the Sabbath 
(see 1 Mate. ii. 34, &c.). And the Jews and judaizing Christians 
would observe the Law although it had been abrogated by Christ 
before the capture of Jerusalem. I may add that when the legal 
observances were abrogated by Christ at Pentecost, they were 
thenceforward dead, and were no longer binding ; but they did not 
immediately become deadly , but it was permitted the Jews who 
were converted to Christ still to keep them for several years, out 
of reverence for Moses and the Law, until, being better instructed 
in evangelical liberty, they passed into perfect union with the 
Gentiles in the Church of Christ, as I have said in Gal. ii So 
S. Chrysostom. Theophylact, Euthymius.

THE GREAT TRIBULATION. 


71 


Christ here alludes to the capture of Jerusalem, which was to 
take place upon the Sabbath, as Dio Cassius asserts in his account 
of Nero. Indeed, one Gaspar Sanchez (in Zach. 14, nunu 27) 
takes the words literally, as though Christ foretold that the Jews 
would take to flight upon the Sabbath, because Jerusalem was to be 
taken on that day. But Christ is here giving signs which were 
to precede the destruction of Jerusalem, so that men might flee 
away and escape, as I have already said. But in the actual siege 
and destruction, Titus had so completely encompassed the city by 
a wall, that it was impossible to flee out of it, as Josephus testifies. 

Then shall be great tribulation , &c. Some, with S. Augustine 
(Epist. 80, ad Hesych.) y confine the words, such as was not , nor ever 
shall be , to the Jews (for Christ thus far has been speaking of them), 
meaning that neither in the Egyptian, nor the Assyrian, nor the 
Babylonian, nor the Syrian distress under Antiochus Epiphanes, 
bad they suffered such slaughter as they should suffer under Titus 
and the Romans; yea, that they never would suffer anything so 
terrible, because Titus would bring upon them the extremity of 
destruction and desolation which were to continue until the end of 
the world. 

With greater latitude others think that this destruction of the Jews 
by Titus is to be considered as more terrible than the destruction 
and punishment which befell any other nation whatsoever. For 
the Jews were not from the beginning of the world, but took their 
rise from Abraham and Jacob. In this way the meaning would be, 
that neither the burning of Sodom, nor the drowning of Pharaoh, 
nor the destruction of the Canaanites by Joshua, nor the overthrow 
of Nineveh or Babylon, or of any other nation, however dreadful 
and terrible, which ever has been or shall be, was so dreadful as 
this destruction of Judaea, which was to take place under Titus. 
I have spoken of separate and individual nations, because the 
destruction of the whole world by the general Deluge in the time 
of Noah, and the general conflagration at the last day, with the 
common destruction of all, surpasses in horror the destruction of 
the single nation of the Jews. In like manner, the persecution of

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


Antichrist will be more horrible, forasmuch as it will be a general 
persecution of all Christians who in all nations believe in Christ. 

Christ therefore compares the destruction of the one nation of 
the Jews with that of any other nation whatsoever, but not with the 
destruction of all nations, or of the whole world. That these things 
were so, is plain from the seven books which Josephus compiled 
( de Bell. Jud.). Thus he says expressly (6. n), “To speak briefly, 
I am of opinion that no other city ever suffered such calamities, 
nor in any other nation of which there is memory among men was 
the wickedness of the seditious more ferocious.” 

S. Chrysostom assigns as the reason of this most dreadful de- 
struction of the Jews, the awful nature of their crime, by which they 
crucified their own Messiah, Christ, the Son of God. Wherefore, 
from this destruction and unceasing desolation of the Jewish nation, 
you may prove to the Jews that Christ has come already, and that 
it is He whom they have slain. For God has never punished any 
other crime, either among the Jews or any other nation, so fearfully 
as He has punished this, their Christidde and Deicide. Whence 
rightly, Auclor Imperfecti , “ Until Christ, although the Jews were 
sinners, yet they were accounted as sons, and as sons they were 
punished. But after the Lord was crucified they ceased to be 
sons, and were treated as enemies, and as such were rooted out, 
without any hope of salvation. For inasmuch as they had com- 
mitted a crime, the like whereof had never been committed, nor 
yet would be committed again, so there came upon them such a 
sentence as never has been passed, nor ever will be passed upon 
any others.” This is what S. Luke says, Then shall he the days 
of vengeance, i.e., for the death of Christ There shall be great 
affliction and wrath upon this people. Josephus adds {Bell. 7. 16) 
that Titus recognized this vengeance of God, and attributed the 
capture of Jerusalem, not to his own power, but to Him. For en- 
tering into the captured city, when he saw the height and solidity 
of the bulwarks and towers, he exclaimed, “ It is evident that God 
has helped us to fight It was God Himself who cast down the 
Jews from those mountains. For what power of man, or what

machines, would have been able to do so ? ” The same Josephus 
(Bell. 6 . 14) adds, that when Titus went round and saw the ditches 
full of the corpses of the dead, he groaned aloud, and lifting up his 
hands to Heaven, called God to witness that it was not his work. 

Luke adds, xxl 24, 1st. They shall fall by the edge of the sword \ 
i.e., they shall be slain by the swords of the Romans. Josephus 
asserts that, besides innumerable others slain in all parts of Judaea, 
there fell in the siege of Jerusalem alone 1,100,000 souls, who 
died by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. 

2d. And they shall be carried captive among all nations . The 

same writer says that 97,000 Jews were taken captive at that time. 
And he adds that the multitude of the Jews who flocked together 
at that time to the Passover out of all the world, amounted to 
2,700,000 souls. Wherefore he adds, that the whole nation was 
as it were shut up in a prison by fate ; and the city was besieged 
when it was crammed full of people. Therefore the number of 
those who fell, including those whom the Romans killed or took 
captive, exceeded the number who fell by any other divinely sent 
judgment, or destruction wrought by man. For, opening the 
sewers, and uncovering the sepulchres, they slew those whom they 
found there. In addition to these, there were found in those 
places 2000 who had fallen by their own hands, or by wounds 
received from one another. 

3d. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the 
times of the Gentiles are fulfilled , i.e., until the end of the world and 
of all nations. For when the number of the Gentiles, according to 
God’s decree, has been completed, all the people and the number of 
the Gentiles shall be finished together with the world. So Euthy- 
mius ; or as Bede, until the plenitude of the Gentiles shall enter 
into the Church of Christ. For when this shall be accomplished, 
then “all Israel shall be saved,” as the Apostle says (Rom. xi.), 
which shall be in the end of the world. For Christ has regard to 
the desolation of Jerusalem. This was foretold by Daniel (ix.), 
where it is said, “ The desolation shall continue unto the consum- 
mation and the end,” meaning that Jerusalem, after being razed to

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


the ground and laid desolate by Titus, shall be no longer the capital 
city of the Jews, but shall belong to the Gentiles, and after that to 
the Christians, and after that to the Saracens and the Turks, as it is 
at present. And this state of things shall continue until the end of 
the world, when Antichrist, the king and Messias of the Jews, shall 
fix the seat of his empire at Jerusalem, as is plain from Apoc. xi. 8. 
And then shall Enoch and Elias resist Antichrist, and convert many 
of the Jews to Christ. After Antichrist is slain, all the Jews shall 
be brought to Christ by the disciples of Enoch and Elias, and shall 
publicly worship Christ in Jerusalem, as may be easily gathered from 
Apoc. xx. 8. 

Eusebius adds (If. E. 4. 6), that Adrian, who succeeded Trajan 
as emperor of Rome, made a severe edict that all Jews whatsoever 
should depart out of Judaea, so that it should not be lawful for any 
of them to see Judaea. He adds, “ This was done, so that after the 
ruin of the Jewish nation, the inhabitants of the city being changed, 
the name of Jerusalem itself was changed to Elia, from the cogno- 
men of the Emperor ^Elius Adrianus.” Behold, this is what Christ 
foretold— Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles. 

From these words of Christ S. Cyril of Jerusalem rightly con- 
futed the Jews, who, at the instigation of Julian the Apostate, set 
about rebuilding the Temple. He predicted that all their labour 
would be in vain, because Christ had declared out of Daniel that 
the desolation of Jerusalem and of the Temple would continue unto 
the end of the world. And he was a true seer. For fire coming 
down from Heaven consumed all the tools of the workmen. And a 
great earthquake tore up the foundation-stones and dispersed them, 
and destroyed the adjacent buildings. On the following night, 
impressions of the sign of the cross, shining like rays of the sun, 
appeared impressed upon the garments of the Jews, which by no 
efforts were they able to efface. (So Socrates , H. E. 3. 20.)

who are all those who shall be saved. Both classes may be here 
understood, but especially the second. For these are they who are 
perfectly elected And whosoever are elected to final grace, so that 
they persevere in it to the end of life, are those who are also elected 
to glory. The sense is — unless God from eternity had decreed, and 
had fulfilled the same in time, that the days of the wasting of Jud&a 
should be shorter — shorter, I mean, than the sins of the Jews and 
the anger of the Romans demanded, all Jews would have perished 
For if the time of the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of 
Judaea had lasted longer, no flesh, no Jews, would have survived 
For the rage of the Romans against the Jews was very great, as 
against a rebellious and obstinate nation ; and unless the gentleness 
of Titus had somewhat restrained them, the Romans would have 
slain all the Jews. God therefore shortened this time of slaughter 
for the elects sake ; that is, partly for the sake of those Christians who 
had not been able or willing to flee away from Jerusalem, partly on 
account of the Jews who, in the great slaughter of the siege, had 
been converted to Christ, as well as for the sake of those who were 
afterwards to be sprung from them and converted to Christ What 
is meant is this, “ If this tribulation of the Jews had lasted longer, 
none of them would have continued alive, and would not, by conse- 
quence have persevered in faith and grace in this life, and so no 
one of them would have survived to be elect and saved. In order, 
therefore, that some may survive, who by the predestination of God 
shall be saved, those, namely, whom God foresees and foreordains, 
shall remain in this tribulation, and be converted to Christ, and so 
be saved, for this cause, I say, God will abbreviate and cut short 
these days of tribulation.” 

That such was the case appears from Josephus (Bell. 7. 15). He 
testifies that more than forty thousand Jews were saved by Titus in 
the destruction of Jerusalem. Where observe that God, for the 
sake of His elect and believing ones, saved alive many Jews who 
did not believe, but were obstinate and reprobate. “ Therefore,” 
says S. Chrysostom, “let not the Jews say that these things 
happened to them because of the preaching and worship of Christ

He shows not only that Christians were not the cause of these evils, 
but that if there had been no Christians, all Jews would have per- 
ished. For if the war, by Divine permission, had been prolonged, no 
remnant of the Jews would have escaped. But in order that the 
believing Jews might not be destroyed with the unbelieving, God 
put a more speedy end to the war than He would have done.” 
Tropologically : Learn from hence how great is God’s love and care 
for His elect. For them He spared many Jews. For the elect’s 
sake God created, and still preserves the whole world, and all the 
things that are therein. Yea, for their sake He caused Christ, His 
own Son, to become man, and willed that He should suffer death 
upon the cross. Wherefore S. Paul saith (i Cor . iii. 22), “All 
things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, 
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. 

Ver. 23. Then if any man , &c. Some think that Christ here 
passes from the signs of the destruction of Jerusalem to those 
before the end of the world. But it is better to refer them to the 
destruction of Jerusalem, of which He has been speaking thus far. 
This is the force of the word then, 

Lo , here is Christ The Jews knew that the advent of the 
Messiah was now nigh at hand, because the sceptre had been 
transferred from Judah to aliens, Herod and the Romans, accord- 
ing to Jacob’s prophecy {Gen. xlix. 10). Wherefore, many at that 
time flattered Vespasian by saying that he was the Messiah, as we 
learn from Suetonius. Others gave Herod the same flattering title. 
Moreover, there were at that time in Jerusalem, as Josephus and 
S. Jerome testify, three factions, which had each its own leader, 
who boasted himself to be the Messiah, who would defend the Jews 
against the Romans. These chiefs were Eleazar the son of Simon, 
John the son of Levi, Simon the son of Goria, who all contended 
for supremacy amongst themselves. Such also was the impostor 
who, under Adrian, pretended to be Messiah, and wished to be 
called Barchochabas, the son of a Star, as though in him was 
fulfilled the prophecy of Balaam, “ A star shall rise out of Jacob.” 
Of this man Eusebius says {H. E. 4. 6) : “ Barchochabas, a wicked

and cruel man, was the leader of a Jewish army. And referring 
to the signification of his name, he persuaded them, as if they had 
been vile slaves, that he was a great star for their salvation, and 
that he bore the succour of light to sick mortals and those who 
were doomed to long darkness.” 

Such in our own age were David George ; also John of Leyden, 
who seized a monastery in a city of Westphalia, where he made 
himself Christ, a king, and created twelve apostles, whom he sent 
into all the neighbouring cities, that they should bring all men to 
him as Christ. But being besieged by the Catholics and captured, 
he was hung alive in a wickerwork cage from the top of a tower, 
and being eaten by flies and wasps, he died a.d. 1536. There 
shall be many more such in the time of Antichrist. Tropologically : 
such are heresiarchs, who proclaim another Christ, in that they 
affirm other doctrines, which are not the doctrines of Christ, but of 
Antichrist For although the word then properly denotes the time 
of the destruction of Jerusalem, yet it may be taken indefinitely, 
so as to denote any period whatsoever, from the fall of Jerusalem 
to the end of the world, as S. Chrysostom observes ( Horn. 77). 
Moreover, the heretics foolishly say that by the words, if any man 
thall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ , Catholics are denoted, because 
they say of the Eucharist, “Lo, here is Christ.” For Christ is 
here speaking of visible heretics and false prophets, who shall call 
themselves Christs, and draw away disciples after them. He is not 
speaking of the Eucharist, where Christ is invisible. 

Ver. 24. For there shall arise false Christs , &c. Signs, wrought by 
art magic, by the power of the devil, whom many heresiarchs have 
had as a familiar spirit, as I have shown in 1 Tim. iv. 1. Such 
was their great prince Simon Magus, who deluded Nero and the 
Romans, so that they erected a statue to him at Rome; but at 
length he himself flying through the air by the aid of the devil, 
was dashed down to the earth by the prayers of S. Peter, and falling 
upon a stone, broke his knees, “ so that he who had attempted to 
fly was not able to walk; and he who had taken wings, lost his 
legs,” as S. Maximus says (Horn. 5, de SS. Petro et Paulo \

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


So as to deceive — even the elect Understand this of final falling 
away, in such a sense that the elect should finally fall from grace, 
and be lost For there is no surer sign of reprobation than that 
any one should apostatize from the faith. Falsely, therefore, does 
Calvin infer from this passage that the elect cannot sin. They 
do sin, but they repent and rise again. 

If it were possible. So great shall be the tribulation and the 
temptation of the false Christs and heretics, their power, deceit, 
guile, and speciousness, that, if such a thing were possible, even 
the elect would be seduced by them, and come over to their 
errors and heresies, and so fall from the faith and be damned. 
But this can never happen, because of God’s more powerful 
protection, and His infallible predestination, as S. Augustine 
says (de Civ. xx. 19), and according to Christ’s own words, “I 
give unto them eternal life, and they shall not perish eternally: 
and no one shall pluck them out of My Father’s hand,” S. John 
x. 28 (Vulg.). For it is not possible that the elect should fall 
away so as to become reprobate. I do not speak of any physical 
or absolute necessity, but of that moral foreknowledge and pre- 
destination of God, by which He so works, and so disposes it, 
and combines it with the issue of future events, that there is 
necessity in a composite sense, as Theologians say. For although 
the elect are free, and free to sin, to go astray, and be lost, 
nevertheless, inasmuch as it has been laid down that God has 
predestinated and foreseen that they cannot sin, go astray, and 
be damned, it is impossible that they should sin, go astray, and be 
damned. For the predestination of God is most sure, and cannot 
fail. These two things, therefore, cannot co-exist, that a man 
should be predestinated, and yet be damned; that God should 
foreknow that such a man will die in His grace, and be saved, 
and also foreknow that he will die in sin, and be damned. In a 
similar manner S. John speaks of the Jews (xiL 39), “ Wherefore 
they could not believe, because Isaiah saith again, He hath 
blinded their eyes:” not as though Isaiah’s prophecy were the 
cause why the Jews did not believe in Christ, but because bis

prediction of the incredulity of the Jews was incompatible with 
their believing in Christ And S. Paul says (i Tim, ii. 19), “The 
foundation of God (concerning the elect) standeth sure, having 
this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.” 

Moreover, those Theologians who say that the elect unto glory are 
persons who have been elected independently of all prevision of 
their works, ascribe the force of this election, this necessity of their 
being saved, to the Divine decree ; but the others, in order not to 
take away man’s free will, must take the matter in a composite 
sense. They must combine the constancy and perseverance of the 
elect with God’s decree to bestow this perseverance upon them, in 
such manner as not to interfere with their free will, and with His 
carrying this out in time, that is to say, by giving them in time 
grace of congruity and grace efficacious, whereby they may effectu- 
ally, but of their own free will, resist heretics, and persevere in the 
faith and grace of God. Nor is it more wonderful that those 
cannot fall whom God wills not to fall (for who hath resisted His 
will ?), than that they cannot fall whom God has foreseen will not 
fall. For God’s prescience and His will are both infallible. 

Some by the elect in this place understand those who are especially 
beloved and chosen of God, and who, on that account, are wont to 
suffer dreadful things from the devil and heretics and wicked men ; 
but they bravely and constantly resist and overcome them. It is 
meant, that so great shall be the temptation, that even most holy 
men, religious and apostolic, who are especially dear to God, would 
fall away from the faith, if such a thing could be, and the more 
powerful grace and sure election of God did not prevent it. 

Ver. 26. ]f therefore> they shall say, &c. Christ here denotes Simon 
of Gerasa, who collected a multitude of robbers and soldiers in the 
deserts and mountains, on the pretext that, being Messiah, he would 
defend the Jews against the Romans. He was admitted into 
Jerusalem to be a check upon the Zealots, but he acted as tyranni- 
cally towards the citizens as the Zealots themselves. (Josh. Bell, 
5 - 7 -) 

In the secret chambers; that is, the innermost and secret places

of the Temple, where God is accustomed to manifest His presence 
and aid the Jews, that He may now protect them by means of His 
Messias from the Romans. Christ here signifies Eleazar and John, 
the leaders of the Zealots, who occupied the inner court of the 
Temple, on the pretext of defending the city against the Romans, 
but in reality that they might rule over it and despoil it So 
Josephus (de Bell. 6. i and 4, and 7. n). He relates that when 
the Temple was on fire, many Jews fled to the porch without the 
Temple, because a certain false prophet had said that those who 
fled to the Temple on that day would be safe under God's protec- 
tion. But those all perished— either by the flames or the sword of 
the Romans. 

Luke adds, The days shall come when ye shall desire to see one of 
the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see it. That is, “The 
time shall come when ye shall desire my Presence which ye have 
now, both for your consolation in so great tribulation, and for the 
manifestation and confutation of the errors and heresies which shall 
arise.” 

Ver. 27. For as the lightnings &c. Ye must not give credit to 
wanderers, who shall say, Messiah, the Saviour of the Jews from the 
Romans, is hidden in desert places, or in secret chambers in the 
Temple ; for when He shall come the second time to judgment to 
bless the saints and condemn the wicked, He will appear publicly 
to the whole world. The Judge of all will appear like the lightning, 
radiant with great glory and majesty, so as to dazzle the eyes of all, 
and turn them upon Himself, in such a manner that no one will be 
able to doubt that He is the Christ the Saviour of the world. He 
means, “My advent, My return to judgment, will be like the 
lightning, because — 1st, it will be sudden ; 2d, it will be unex- 
pected ; 3d, it will be manifest to all ; 4th, it will be glorious ; 5th, 
mighty, so that no one can resist it ; 6th, it will not be on the earth, 
but in the air, like the lightning, which makes itself plain to view ; 
not in a corner, but to the world in a moment of time.” For Christ 
» here replying to the mind and thoughts of the Apostles. For 
they thought that Christ would inaugurate His glorious Kingdom

THE CARCASE.

upon earth immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem. So S. 
Chrysostom, “For as the lightning needs no preacher nor mes- 
senger, but appears in a moment to all, so shall that advent be seen 
everywhere alway to shine immediately.” Also Auetor Imperfectly 
“As lightning traverses all things in the twinkling of an eye, so 
likewise shall the Son of God not seem to be coming, but to have 
come. For if the sun, which has been created for our service, 
possesses such splendour, that in whatsoever part of the heavens 
it may be, it appeareth everywhere present ; how much more shall 
Christ, the Spiritual Sun, when He cometh, be seen by all the world, 
or rather, the world be seen by Him ? ” 

This author adds, that Christ here makes mention of lightning, 
because lightning shall go before Him when He comes to judg- 
ment, according to the words of the Psalm, xcvii. 4, 5, “His 
lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the 
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.” 

Wheresoever the carcase is , &c. There is an allusion to Job 
xxxix. 33, And wheresoever the carcase (Heb. the slain) shall be , 
he will be there. After the metaphor of lightning, he subjoins the 
parable of the eagle; both because, as the eagle is not struck by 
lightning, so the elect will not be affected by the thunderbolt of 
the sentence and the curse with which Christ shall condemn the 
wicked to hell in the Day of Judgment, as also in order that the 
Apostles might not suppose that the glorious Advent of Christ 
should, like lightning, pass away, and should ask, “What reward 
will accrue to us therefrom ? ” Christ gives the assurance that He 
will indeed appear like the lightning unto all, but that He will 
abide with His elect, and will feed them with His glory, as an eagle 
feeds upon a body as its prey and food. 

Carcase . The Vulg. seems to have read <r 5 ,ua, as some copies 
still have it. But a better reading is rrupuiy which properly signi- 
fies ruinyfally and from hence comes to mean a carcase . IT ru/ia

a hare, or some such thing as eagles hunt This is called nrSt/Mt, 
because the bodies of those creatures which eagles capture fall 
upon the earth. For the eagle is too noble to eat carrion, or the 
dead body of anything save of what it has itself captured and 
killed. 

Aristotle, however (lib. 9, Hislor. Anim. c. 32), enumerates six 
kinds of eagles, and amongst them the ywrcefrot, or vulture-eagle, 
that is to say, a species which seeks out dead bodies. Hence the 
LXX. in Job xxxix. 27 translate by ykj/. This is the bird of which 
Christ here speaks, according to Aldrovandus and others. Both 
meanings and readings suit this passage, as I will presently show. 

The words constitute an enigmatical parable, signifying that 
Christ cannot be hid. As though He had said, “As eagles discern 
the bodies upon which they prey, even from on high, and fly 
towards them, and as a vulture smells a carcase even when it is 
very far off ; so in like manner shall My glorious return to judge the 
world not be hidden or secret, but manifest to all. Wherefore the 
faithful and righteous at that time, like eagles of most piercing 
sight, and like vultures of most acute scent, shall, by divine power, 
scent Me out, that is, they shall perceive Me beforehand They 
shall discern Me with their eyes, and fly to Me, that they may 
most happily feed upon Me and upon My glory, and be refreshed 
and blessed for ever.” And in truth there shall be no need 
then to search where is Christ. For His Advent shall be glorious, 
and visible to all the world. This is what Paul says, “We shall 
be snatched up into the clouds, to meet Christ in the air, and so 
shall we ever be with the Lord ” (1 Thess . iv. 17). 

Christ compares Himself to a carcase, that He may signify His 
death, by which He merited glory for us. He compares Himself 
also to a body made alive again, that He may signify His glorious 
Resurrection, by which He will feed and bless His elect Where- 
fore S. Hilary gathers from this passage that the universal judgment 
of Christ will take place on that spot where He hung a corpse upon 
the cross, and where He was buried, — that is to say, near Jeru- 
salem, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, as Joel teaches (iii. 2). Hear

THE EAGLES. 


83 


& Hilary, "He called the saints eagles, from the flight of the 
spiritual body, whose gathering together by the angels He showed 
would be in the place of His Passion. And rightly may His 
glorious Advent there be expected, where for us He procured an 
eternity of glory by the sufferings of the body of His humility." 
And S. Jerome says, " Eagles are they who take wings to fly to the 
Passion of Christ." It is agreeable to reason that Christ should 
there judge all men, where He was unjustly judged for all ; and 
that His glory should be there seen, where His lowliness and 
humility were witnessed ; that He should descend from Heaven 
in the place where He ascended into Heaven, and that so the 
whole work of our salvation should be completed and finished in 
that same spot where it was begun. 

Moreover, the saints are rightly compared to eagles, because 
the eagle is the king of birds, as the lion is the king of beasts. 
So likewise are the Saints kings, not of earth, but of Heaven. 
Hear Origen, " He said not, where the carcase is, thither shall the 
vultures or the crows be gathered together, but the eagles, to 
signify that those who have believed in the Passion of the Lord 
are all great and regal." 

Here also Auctor Imperfectly who for eagles understands vultures , 
"Concerning vultures, the Scripture saith in the Book of Job, 
Wheresoever the carcase is, there will be found the vulture’s young 
ones. For this is the natural property of vultures. As some say, 
they can scent a corpse even across the sea. But because vultures 
are foul birds, Christ adopted the name of eagles to the habits of 
vultures, that thus might be shown the gathering together of the 
Saints to the Advent of Christ, that in the royal eagles the regal 
dignity might be shown. For in this manner are the Saints like 
unto eagles, because as eaglets are proved by the sun, in such 
manner, that if without blenching they can look straight up at the 
sun, they are considered legitimate offspring, but if they cannot 
do this, they are regarded as spurious ; so, also, the sons of God 
are proved by the justice of Christ If they are able fully to 
accept the words of His justice, they are understood to be

S. MATTHEW, c. XXIV. 


legitimate ; but if not, they are understood to be the offspring of 
the devil.” 

2. Because, as S. Ambrose says (in S. Luke xviii.), eagles renew 
themselves. So also the Saints are renewed here by grace, and 
hereafter by glory, according to those words of the Psalm, “They 
shall renew their strength like eagles.” 

3. Because there is something divine about the eagle. As Aris- 
totle says (lib. 9, Hist. Anirn. c. 32), “Eagles fly on high, that 
they may see to the farthest possible extent. Wherefore men 
say that the eagle is the only bird which is divine.” Hence 
by eagles S. Chrysostom understands the multitude of Angels, 
Martyrs, Saints, who all, as it were divine spirits, shall be gathered 

together to Christ their God in the Day of Judgment, that they 

* 

may ascend up with Him in glory to Heaven. 

4. The saints are eagles, because they fly above the earth, and 
mount up to Heaven, that they may behold heavenly things, and 
look down upon earthly things as far beneath them. Whence they 
say with S. Paul, “ Our conversation is in Heaven.” 

5. As eagles possess sharp and strong sight, so as to be able with 
unblenching eye to gaze at the sun ; thus do the Saints assiduously, 
with the keen eyes of their minds, contemplate Christ, who is the 
Sun of justice. 

Allegorically : the Body of Christ is the Church, in which are 
eagles , that is, spiritual persons of heavenly life and doctrine. So, 
on the contrary, heretics are like black crows and ch&ttering daws ; 
or like moles, wholly conversant with earth and earthly things. 
Hear S. Ambrose (in Luc. c. xvii. last ver.\ “ Do not the eagles seem 
to thee to be about the Body, when the Son of Man shall come in 
that Day with clouds of them that understand? When every eye 
shall see Him, and they also that pierced Him? This is the Body 
of which it has been said, ‘ My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood 
is drink indeed/ Round about this Body are the true eagles, who 
fly with spiritual wings. There likewise fly the eagles who believe 
that Jesus is come in the flesh. ‘For every spirit that confesseth 
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.’ For where there

is faith, there is the sacrament, there is the abode of sanctity. This 
is the Body of the Church, in which by the grace of baptism we are 
renewed in spirit, and the decay of age is renewed by the return of 
youth.” 

Anagpgically : the Blessed, in the Day of Judgment, after the 
Resurrection, shall be gathered together to the Body, *.*, to Christ 
risen and glorified, that they may fiy with Him to life in Heaven. 
By eagles is denoted the swiftness of the Blessed, according to the 
words in Isa. xL, “They shall fly like eagles.” Wherefore S. Gregory 
expounds thus (S. Thom . in Catena ), “ Wheresoever the Body? &c. 
As though Christ had said, “Because I, incarnate, preside in the 
heavenly seat, I sustain with flesh the life of My elect, I lift 
them up to Heaven.” And S. Ambrose (in Ps. xlix. sub finem ), for 
body , reading ruin, or fall, which is the meaning of the Greek *ru,*a, 
says, “ Where the ruin is, there are the eagles ; i.e., where He fell, 
there He rose again.” Again, the eagle is the symbol of the blessed 
eternity of the Saints. For the eagle is very long-lived, and when it 
grows old it renews its youth. Hence the proverb, “ The old age 
of an eagle.” 

Symbolically : the eagle , because it has sharp sight, is a symbol of 
truth. Whence S. Ambrose, “ Where the body? &c., i.e., “Where 
the Body of Christ is, there is truth.” Again, the eagle is a type of 
the angels, because of their swiftness. Therefore S. Ambrose (lib. i, 
de Sacram . c. 2) understands the words of the Eucharist. For at 
the Eucharist, where the Body of Christ is, the eagles, i.e., the angels, 
assist. So also do the Saints and Priests. The same also saith 
(lib. 4, c. 2), “The form of the Body is the altar; the Body of 
Christ is on the altar. Ye are eagles, renewed by being washed 
from sin.” 

Ver. 29. But immediately after the tribulation, &c. Christ passes 
from the destruction of Jerusalem to the destruction of the world, 
and the signs which shall precede it.

at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus. For this only did He call tribu- 
lation a little above in ver. 21. Where observe, with S. Chrysostom, 
Jerome, and others, that Christ, in order to keep His disciples and 
those who succeeded them in constant expectation of His Advent 
and the Day of Judgment, and to urge them to be always prepared 
for it, seems to favour the mistake of the Apostles, and to speak as 
though the end of the world would follow immediately upon the 
destruction of the city, but in a different way from that in which the 
Apostles understood it For although 1560 years have elapsed 
since the destruction of Jerusalem, and many more will yet elapse 
before the end of the world, nevertheless all this period, long as it 
seems to us, whose span of life is so short, yet compared with the 
eternity of God, who is the true Measurer of times, is but very small, 
yea, only as it were a moment. Thus answers S. Peter (2 Pet. iii. 8), 
“ One day is with God as a thousand years, and a thousand years 
as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise. This 
is why the Prophets and Apostles call the period of Christ and of 
the Gospel Dispensation, the last time and the last hour , as appears 
from 1 John ii. 18; 1 Cor. x. 11 ; Jas. v. 8; Heb. x. 37. For the 
same reason Haggai (ii. 4) says that there shall be but a little while 
to the coming of Christ, and yet there were 517 years still to elapse 
before He came. There is also this to be considered, that the 
tribulation of the world shall immediately follow the tribulation of 
the city, in the sense that no very remarkable and exceptional tribu- 
lation of the Jews shall intervene between those two events, so that 
the one shall very closely succeed the other, not as regards time, but 
in type, similitude, and fearfulness. For a similar reason Isaiah, 
Jeremiah, and the rest of the Prophets, when they describe the de- 
struction of Babylon, Tyre, Egypt, and of Judaea by the Chaldeans, 
pass on at once to the antitype, the destruction of the world, as 
though it were about to take place immediately. And they set forth 
how dreadful shall be the former events by the signs and horrors 
which shall take place at the latter event This appears by Isa. 
xiii. 19 ; Jer. xv. 9 ; Amos viii. 9 ; Joel ii. 10. 

From what has been said, it would seem that Alcazar (in Apoc

vi 12), from the expression “thus” in this verse of S. Matthew, 
gathers incorrectly that all the things which are here spoken of 
refer literally, not to the end of the world, but to the destruction 
of Jerusalem. By the darkening of the sun and moon, and the 
falling of the stars, this writer understands literally the blindness 
of the Jews, their calamities, and the slaughter which was made 
of them by Titus. By the shaking of the powers of the heavens , he 
understands the flight of the Christians from the city, by whose 
holiness it was sustained. But every one can see that these 
meanings are mystical and symbolical 

The sun shall be darkened 1 Observe that this sign and those which 
follow are not after the General Resurrection, as SS. Jerome and 
Chrysostom suppose, but previous to it, as is plain from S. Luke 
xxl 26, and Joel ii. 31. As to the meaning, S. Augustine (Epist. 
80, ad Hesych.) says, “The sun, i.e., the Church, shall be darkened, 
because in those tremendous temptations and tribulations which 
shall be in the end of the world, many who had seemed as bright 
and as firm as the sun and the stars shall fall from the faith.” This 
is the allegorical sense, and is just and apposite. 

You will ask, what will be the cause of this great obscuration 
of the sun before the Judgment Day ? SS. Hilary, Jerome, Chry- 
sostom answer, that it will be because the excessive brightness of 
Christ’s glorious body will make the sun grow pale. But I have 
already observed that these signs will take place before the General 
Resurrection, and therefore before Christ’s coming to judgment 
So that I reply, the sun will be darkened because God will take 
away from it, not its light indeed, but its power of illuminating, by 
which it shall come to pass that in the sun there will be light, but 
upon the earth nothing but darkness. Thus was it at the Passion ot 
Christ Again, God will hide the sun by means of thick clouds and 
smoke. Perchance also there will be extraordinary and miraculous 
eclipses, as may be gathered from Lactantius vii. 16. 

Of this darkening of the sun at the end of the world, the calami- 
ties and prodigies which took place at the destruction of Babylon, 
Tyre, Egypt, Idumaea, &c, were types. When, therefore, the Pro- 


Digitized by L^ooQle 



88 


S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


phets speak of them, they speak by catachresis of the horribleness of 
the destruction, by saying that the sun and moon and stars shall be 
darkened. For such dreadful calamities bring on men giddiness 
and blindness. Thus those overthrows were types and foreshadow- 
ings of the destruction of the world, when the heavenly luminaries 
will be literally darkened 

And the moon, &c. For when the sun is darkened, the moon must 
necessarily be so likewise, since she derives her light from him. 

Symbolically: Auctor lmperfecti says, “When the master of the 
household dies, his whole household is troubled ; his family make 
lamentations and rend their garments. So, in like manner, when 
the human race, for whom all things were made, is about to come 
to an end, all creation languishes, the powers of the heavens mourn, 
and laying aside their brightness, are clothed with robes of dark- 
ness.” 

And the stars , &c. i. Because at the end of the world the stars 
also shall be darkened, so that they shall appear to men to have 
fallen from the heavens. For Holy Scripture often speaks of things 
not as they are in themselves, but as they appear unto men. 

2. Stars , i.e., comets and such like bodies, which are formed 
in the atmosphere, shall then fall upon the earth. This may be 
gathered from Joel ii. 30. 

S. Chrysostom and Euthymius add, that at the end of the world 
stars, properly so called, shall fall from the heavens to the earth. 
But this must be understood of very small stars, and such as are 
invisible to us. For as to the visible stars, they are larger than our 
whole earth, and cannot therefore fall upon it 

And the powers of the heavens , &c. Origen, S. Chrysostom, &c, 
understand by these powers the sevenfold choirs or orders of the 
angels, which are called pouters (Lat. virtutes) because they excel in 
strength (virtute). And the meaning would be, that the angels, 
mighty as they are, when they behold the sun and moon become 
dark, and the stars fall from heaven, and many other dreadful pro- 
digies multiplied at the end of the world, will stand, as it were, 
astonished and stupefied at such great changes and terrible sights.

THE POWERS OF THE HEAVENS. 


89 

Here may be mentioned the opinion of Suarez (3 /. qu. 59, 
art . 6, disp. 56, sect. 3), “ The powers of the heavens,” saith he, “ are 
the angels, who* by their surpassing strength, cause the heavens to 
revolve; because they, as the ministers of the Divine justice and 
vengeance against the wicked, shall change the accustomed order 
of motion of the heavens. Thus there shall be utter confusion in 
this lower world.” 

But more simply, by the powers of the heavens , you may under- 
stand the stars themselves and their influences. The meaning is, 
that at the end of the world the very great and very strong stars 
of heaven shall change their motions, appearances, influences, and 
in consequence everything upon earth shall be in perturbation, so 
that the world shall be shaken by unwonted movements, the sea 
shall overflow, and the atmosphere shall be troubled with comets, 
thunderbolts, meteors, whirlwinds, so that all things will seem to 
be utterly in confusion. 

Lastly, and most plainly, by the pouters , &c., you may understand 
their poles and hinges. These are Heb. gibburoth , the 

strength and props, as it were, of the heavens. It means, that at 
the end of the world the whole heavens shall be shaken, all plucked 
from their poles and hinges, so that they will seem to fall down, so 
as to 9 trike terror into the wicked, and to set forth the wrath of an 
angry Christ I have treated of this matter more at length in Apoe. 
vi. 14. There is an allusion to Job xxvi. n, “The pillars of 
heaven shall tremble, and shall fear by reason of His rebuke and 
to Isa. xxxix. 4, “ And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, 
and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll : and all their 
hosts shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a 
falling^ from the fig-tree.” For as Bede says (in Luc. xxi. 25), 
“As when trees are shaken to their fall, they are wont to show 
premonitions of the coming crash ; so likewise when the end of the 
world draweth nigh, shall the elements nod and tremble as though 
they were in fear ; ” and the heavens burning with fire, and as it

S MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


Ver. 30. And then shall appear the sign , &c. You will ask, what 
is the sign of the Son of Man, that is to say, of Christ Incarnate ? 
I answer, it is the Cross. For this is the sign, because it is the 
standard (vexillum) of Christ, and the cause of the victory of 
believers. And as it was beforetime the scandal of unbelievers 
and the impious, so will it be in the Day of Judgment their con- 
demnation and their torment So the Fathers, almost passim . 
Yea, the Church herself gives this meaning her sanction, when she 
sings in the office for Holy Cross Day, “This sign of the Cross 
shall be in heaven when the Lord shall come to judgment” There 
are three reasons why the Cross shall then appear. 1st To signify 
that Christ by the Cross has merited this judicial power and glory. 
2d. To show that Christ was crucified for the salvation of all men, 
and that therefore they are ungrateful and without excuse who 
have neglected so great grace and love. 3d. To show that all 
worshippers of Christ crucified shall be then exalted with Him 
to Heaven, and all who hate and despise Him cast down to 
hell. 

From this saying of Christ it is extremely probable that the 
actual cross on which He was crucified shall appear in heaven 
at the Day of Judgment, for the consolation of the Saints, who 
have been saved by it, and who therefore have striven to conform 
themselves in their lives, by patience and self-denial, to Christ 
crucified; and for the condemnation of the wicked, who have 
despised the Cross of Christ, and who have ungratefully preferred 
pleasures to self-mortification. This is the opinion of S. Chry- 
sostom {Horn, de Cruce et Latrone ). The Sibyl predicts the same 
thing (lib. 6) — 

“ Whereon God hung, O blessed Tree I 
Not earth alone, but heaven hath thee. 

When lightning-crown’d God’s face we see." 

S. Anselm is of a different opinion, viz., that at the Day of Judg- 
ment it will not be the actual Cross of Christ which will appear 
in the air, but a symbol, or image of it, formed by the angels. 
The expression sign is in favour of this.

THE SIGN OF THE CROSS. 


91 


Moreover, SS. Chrysostom and Augustine and S. Cyril teach 
that this standard of the Cross will be borne by the angels before 
the face of Christ, coming to judgment, as a trophy of victory, 
and a royal banner of supreme power and dignity. 

Our Salmeron also says, “The doctors of the Church believe 
that, together with the Cross will appear the pillar, the scourge, 
the crown of thorns, the nails, the sponge, the spear, and the rest 
of the instruments of the Passion.” So, too, S. Thomas ( Opusc . ii. 
cap . 244). This is probable, but not certain, because nowhere 
expressly declared 

Lastly, at that time the sign of the cross shall appear on the 
foreheads of all the elect, according to what is said in Apoc. vil 3, 
“ Let us sign the servants of our God on their foreheads ” ( Vulg .) ; 
and Ezek. ix. 4, in an allegorical sense, “ Sign Tau, ie. f the sign of 
the Cross, upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry ” 
( Hebr . and Vulg). Hear S. Augustine (Serm, de temp . 130), “ Hast 
thou considered how great is the virtue of this sign of the Cross ? 
The sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give her light ; but 
the Cross shall shine and shall obscure the heavenly luminaries. 
When the stars shall fall, it alone shall send forth radiance, that 
thou mayst learn how the Cross is more luminous than the moon 
and more glorious than the sun. For like as when a king enters 
into a city, his soldiers go before him, bearing upon their shoulders 
the royal arms and standards, and all the pomp of military array, 
to proclaim the monarch’s entry ; so when the Lord descends from 
Heaven, the angel hosts shall go before Him, bearing upon their 
lofty shoulders that sign which is the ensign of triumph, to 
announce to the inhabitants of earth the approach of the King of 
Heaven.” 

And then shall all the tribes , &c. That is, many of every tribe, 
viz., all the reprobate and the damned, because they have neglected 
their salvation, to procure which Christ was crucified. But the 
elect will rejoice and sing, because they will see that they have 
been saved and blessed by the Cross. S. Augustine gives the 
cause of this weeping, “All the tribes of the earth shall mourn.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


because they shall see their accuser, that is, the Cross itself; and 
at the sight of this reprover they shall acknowledge their sin. 
Too late, and in vain shall they confess their impious blindness. 
And dost thou marvel that when Christ cometh He will bring His 
Cross, since He will show His wounds also?” S. Chrysostom 
also, “ Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , because they 
shall perceive that they gained nothing by His death, and that 
they crucified Him who ought to be adored.” And S. Jerome, 
“Rightly doth He say, The tribes of the earth; for they shall 
mourn who have no citizenship in Heaven, but whose names are 
written in the earth.” Again, hear S. Chrysostom on this passage 
(Horn. 77), “ He brings with Him the Cross, that their sin may 
be condemned without accusation, as though a man who had been 
struck with a stone should produce the stone itself, or the blood- 
stained clothes as a witness of the deed.” 

Moreover, they shall mourn , because (as Auctor Imperf , Horn. 77, 
says) Christ will then reprove the wicked thus, “For your sakes 
I became man, was bound and crucified. Where is the fruit of all 
My sufferings ? Behold the price of My blood, which I paid for 
the redemption of your souls ! Where is your service, which you 
owe Me as the price of My blood ? I valued you above My own 
glory, when, being God, I appeared in fashion of a man ; and yet 
ye accounted Me of less worth than any of your possessions. For 
ye loved every vile thing upon earth more than My justice and 
faith.” And shortly afterwards he adds, “Deservedly shall they 
mourn, because then neither shall money profit the rich to do 
alms withal ; nor righteous parents be able to intercede for their 
children; nor the angels themselves to say a word, as is their 
wont, for men, because the nature of judgment accords not with 
mercy, as neither the time of mercy with judgment As saith the 
Prophet, ‘I will sing of mercy and judgment;' of mercy in the 
first Advent, of judgment in the second.” 

Heat S. Bernard mourning, yea, trembling with horror ( Serm . 16 
in Cant.), “ I am afraid of hell ; I fear the face of the Judge, 
before whom the heavenly hosts themselves tremble. I tremble

ELOQUENT WORDS OF S. BERNARD.

at His almighty wrath, at the crash of a falling world, at the 
conflagration of the elements, at the horrible tempest, at the voice 
of the archangel, and the dreadful words. I tremble at*the teeth 
of the infernal beast, at the belly of hell, at the lions roaring for 
their prey. I dread the gnawing of the worm, the fiery torrent, 
the smoke and vapour, the brimstone, and the spirit of tempests. 
1 dread the outer darkness.” Then he adds, “ Who will give water 
to my head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes, that by my tears 
I may prevent the weeping and gnashing of teeth, the hard chains 
for hand and foot, the weight of the fetters that press and bind 
and burn without consuming? Woe is me, my mother I Where- 
fore hast thou brought me forth, a child of sorrow? a child of 
bitterness, of indignation, of weeping without end? Why did the 
knees prevent me, and the breasts that I sucked, that I should be 
bom for burning and for fuel of fire?” 

And they shall see the Son> &c. ist. That the clouds may 
temper the exceeding brightness of the Body of Christ, which 
otherwise would blind the eyes of the reprobate, ad. Because a 
cloud is the symbol of the hidden Deity. 3d. Because the cloud 
is the seat, as well as the vehicle and covert, of Christ’s glory. 
Hence, constantly in the Old Testament, God appeared to Moses 
and the Prophets in a cloud ( See Ezek. i. 4, and Ex . xix. 9-18.) 
There is an allusion to Daniel (vii. 13), “And lo, one like unto 
the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven.” 

With power , &c. (Vulg.), with great virtue or strength and 
majesty . For as Christ at His first Advent came in great infirmity 
of the flesh, in poverty and contempt, so He hath thereby deserved 
to come in His second Advent with great strength, glory, and 
majesty. His power and strength shall appear in that at His 
command all the dead shall arise in a moment ; in that all men, 
angels, and devils shall behold and worship Him as their God, 
their Lord, and their Judge ; in that He shall pass sentence upon 
all according to their deserts, and shall execute His sentence, so 
that none shall dare to gainsay or resist His majesty shall 
appear in the infinite splendour of His body, in the multitude and

brightness of all the angels surrounding Him, and in His garments 
of radiant clouds. 

Ver. 31. And He shall send His angels ; &c There is an inver- 
sion of order in this passage ; for Christ shall previously send His 
angels with a trumpet, or rather with many trumpets, throughout 
all the world, to wake the dead and summon them to judgment. 
For when this trumpet sounds very many angels shall gather 
together the ashes of every one of the dead, and from them form 
the semblance of human bodies, which God shall organize and 
animate. And after life has been restored to those bodies, He shall, 
if they be those of the holy and elect, glorify and bless them. 
Wherefore also the Blessed themselves shall, by the gift of swiftness, 
with which they shall be endowed, immediately transfer themselves 
in the company of the angels from all parts of the world to the 
Valley of Jehoshaphat to judgment But the reprobate, because 
they shall lack the gift of swiftness, shall be dragged thither by the 
devils, or rather by the angels. 

From the four winds, i.e., from the four quarters of the world, 
from whence the four chief winds blow. Whence he adds by way 
of explanation, from one end of Heaven to the other . 

The Greek is anew fa; i.e., from extremity to 

extremity , from one terminus of heaven and earth to their other 
terminus, from the east to the west For &x(a signifies any extreme 
limit , whether above or below, whether to the right or to the left. 
Mark has (xiii. 27), from the height of earth to the height of heaven 
(Vulg.), by which is meant the same thing as in S. Matthew, from 
one extreme of earth to the other extremity of heaven and earth. 
For the earth at its extremities seems to be joined to the sky. 
This is at the horizon. There is no reason why extremity of heaven 
(Vulg.) in this place should not be taken literally, meaning that the 
angels shall gather together the elect wherever they may be, 
whether in heaven or earth. For the bodies of the Patriarchs, who 
rose again with Christ, are in Heaven. Wherefore they shall 
descend from Heaven to the valley of Jehoshaphat at the time of 
the Last Judgment

PARABLE OF THE FIG-TREE. 


95 


But the former sense seems to be the best 

Learn a parable. Take a similitude from the fig-tree. Learn from 
the analogy of the fig-tree what I have spoken concerning the signs 
of the destruction of the world, when it is nigh at hand. Christ 
makes mention of the fig rather than of other trees, because the 
fig-tree only puts forth its leaves and fruit under the influence of 
heat, because its sap is exceedingly sweet, and therefore concocted ; 
and for that there is need of the heat of summer. Hence Aristotle 
{lib. 9, Bistor. Animal.) says that the fig is the food of bees, 
which only fly and make honey in summer. They make honey 
from the fig, for it is indeed a purse of honey. Again, ne says that 
cattle grow fat upon figs. Again, the fig does not flower, but 
produces fruit immediately from the leaves, and brings it to 
maturity. Whence Pliny says (15. 18), “Wonderful is the haste 
of this fruit, one in all things hastening to maturity by the art of 
nature.” Again, “ the fig is the sweetest of all fruits, devoid of all 
acidity, and therefore most tasty and wholesome. Moreover, the 
fig-tree is extremely fruitful, so much so that there are fig-trees in 
Hyrcania, each yielding a yearly produce of 70 bushels,” as Pliny 
affirms in the same book. He adds that Romulus and Remus were 
suckled by the she-wolf under a fig-tree, and therefore that the fig 
was worshipped at Rome in the forum. 

Symbolically , therefore, Christ would intimate that His Saints and 
elect ought to bring forth most sweet and abundant fruits of good 
works, that so they may deserve to taste in the summer of the 
Resurrection the abundant sweetness of celestial glory. 

Lastly, a fig was the cause of the destruction of Carthage. For 
when Cato, as Pliny tells us, was exclaiming in the Senate that 
Carthage must be destroyed, he brought one day into the Senate 
house a very ripe fig which had been grown in Africa. Showing it 
to the Senators, “ I ask you,” said he, “ to guess how long ago it 
is since this fig was plucked from the tree.” All allowed that it 
must have been but recently gathered. “ Yes,” he said, “ I would 
have you know that it is but three days since it was plucked at 
Carthage; so near is the enemy to your walls.” Immediately

96 S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 

afterwards the third Punic War, in which Carthage was destroyed, 
was begun. 

In like manner those signs which Christ compares to a fig-tree 
shall be the cause of the destruction of the world. 

When her branch , &c. For the reason already mentioned, inas- 
much as the sap of the fig-tree is most sweet, it lies dormant during 
the winter in the root, but being drawn out by the heat of summer, 
it rises into the branches, and comes out in leaves and fruit. It is 
like the mulberry tree (rnorus), which does not germinate until the 
cold is all gone. The mulberry is called for that reason or 
“a fool/' because it is anything but foolish, but the wisest of 
trees. 

Ver. 33. So likewise ye , &c. Near: it is as though Christ, the 
Judge, and His glorious Kingdom, and your redemption, as Luke 
has it, that is, the resurrection and everlasting glory, were entering 
the earth, as it were by a door. For redemption signifies deliver- 
ance from all evils and miseries. This will be the summer. And 
after the winter, there shall come this most joyful summer to all the 
elect, as this parable intimates. As when the fig comes into leaf 
summer is nigh, which causes to be brought forth most sweet figs 
and other fruits ; so when ye shall behold the elect to flourish with 
such great patience in the winter of such great tribulations as shall 
befall them at the end of the world, know ye that the reward of 
your patience is nigh at hand, the summer of a joyful resurrection, 
which shall heap upon you the fruit of every good gift, when 
Christ the Judge shall bless and glorify you. 

Verily 1 say, &c. This generation, that is to say, 1. of all men, or 
this age, which shall last until the end of the world. So S. Jerome. 
As though Christ had said, “ Before the end of the world all these 
things shall come to pass.” 

2. Origen, Hilary, and Chrysostom take generation in a more 
restricted sense, to mean the generation of believers of Christians, 
that were now sprung from Christ, to whom Christ was speaking 
in the person of His Apostles, according to the words in Ps. 
xxiv. 6, “ This is the generation of them that seek the Lord.” Aa

DURATION OF THE WORLD.

though the Lord had said, “The Christian religion which I have 
instituted shall not come to an end until Christians, who faithfully 
serve Me, are rewarded by Me, and crowned in the Day of 
Judgment.” 

Ver. 35. Heaven and earthy &c., shall pass away, shall be 
changed, shall cease to be, shall perish, as regards their present 
state and condition, that they may pass into one which is better, 
and be glorified with the Saints. 

Some are of opinion that at the end of the world the heavens 
will be changed as regards their form and substance. Of this 
question I have treated at length on 2 Peter iii. 13 and Isa. 
xxxiv. 4. 

Lastly, this sentence may be understood comparatively, thus, 
u The heavens shall pass away and perish, sooner than My words 
shall come to naught.” 

But of that day (namely, of My glorious coming to judgment) 
and hour, &c. As if He had said, “ Do not, O My apostles, ask 
Me when I shall come again as Judge, or what shall be the day 
of the general Judgment, for no one except God knoweth this : 
and He willeth not any other being to know it” “ He held them 
back,” says Chrysostom, “from wishing to learn that which the 
angels are ignorant of.” As to the time when the world shall 
come to an end, there are various opinions. 

1. Many suppose that the world will come to an end after 
it has existed for six thousand years, as it was created in six 
days, according to the saying or prophecy of Elias, “ six thousand ” 
(years?) “the world.” ( Sex millia mundus , Lat.) This opinion is 
probably true, as I have shown at length on Apoc. xx. 4. 

2. Some think that there will be just as many years after Christ 
to the end of the world as there were from the Creation to 
Christ They gather this idea from Hab. iii. 2, “O Lord, revive 
Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years 
Thou shalt make it known.” But this passage has a different 
meaning, as I have there shown. 

The third opinion was one which supposed the world would

last as many jubilees after Christ as there were years in His 
earthly life. This calculation would place the end in a.d. 1700. 

4. Druitlimams, who flourished about a.d. 800, and who wrote 
upon S. Matthew, says, “Our ancestors have left in writing 
that the world was created, the Lord was conceived and cruci- 
fied, on the 25th of March, and in like manner the world will 
be destroyed upon the same day ; but in what year they say not." 
But these things have no foundation. 

5. A fifth calculation was put forth by a contemporary of d 
Lapide> whose name he does not give, whom he calls a jester 
rather than a reckoner, which fixed on 1666 as the end of the 
world. 

“If,” says d Lapide , “you object to this * joculator 9 the words 
of Christ, * of that day knoweth no man/ he answers, that only 
applied to the time when He was speaking, and that the day 
might be known afterwards by revelation or in some other way." 
But all this d Lapide characterises as frivolous and old wives' fables. 

My Father only: because from eternity He had determined in 
His own mind, and appointed this day, which He keeps secret 
Now by the word on/y 9 the Son is not excluded, neither the Holy 
Ghost, for They know the day and the hour of the Judgment 
equally with the Father, since They have all the same essence, 
majesty, will, mind, power, understanding, and knowledge. For 
it is a theological principle, that if the word “only” be added 
to any of the essential attributes of the Godhead, such as wisdom, 
and be ascribed to one of the Divine Persons, it does not exclude 
the other two Persons, but only creatures, which are of a different 
nature and essence. But in Personal Attributes, the expression 
“only" does exclude two of the Divine Persons, as when it is 
said, “The Father only begets;" “The Son only is begotten." 

You will say, Mark adds (xiil 32), neither the Son , for so it 
is in the Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Egyptian, Ethiopia 
Various answers are given. The best is that which is common 
among the Fathers It is that the Son, both as God and as 
man, by infused knowledge, knows the Day of Judgment and of

the end of the world, for it pertains lor Him to know this, inas- 
much as He has been appointed the Judge of the world. But 
Christ denies that He knoweth this as man, and as He is God’s 
messenger to us, because He did not know it so that He could 
reveal it to us, or because He had not been commissioned by 
the Father to reveal it to us. As an ambassador who was 
questioned concerning the secrets of his prince would reply that 
he did not know them, although he did know them, because he 
did not know them as an ambassador. For an ambassador 
declares only those things which he has a commission to declare. 

Christ’s meaning then is, “God only knows what year and day 
and hour the end of the world and the Judgment shall be. 
And although God has caused Me, Christ, as I am man, to 
know the same, as I am that one man who is united to the 
Word; yet as I am the Father’s ambassador to men, He hath 
not willed Me to make known that day, but to keep it secret, 
and to stir them up continually to prepare themselves for it” 
There is a like mode of expression in S. John xv. 15. 

There are some who explain thus: that Christ, qua man, 
knoweth not the Day of Judgment; but that He knoweth it as 
He is the God-man. That is to say, Christ as man knoweth it 
not by virtue of His humanity, but of His divinity. So S. 
Athanasius {Sermon 4, contra Arian .), Nazianzen {Or at 4, de 
Theolog.), Cyril (lib. 9, Thesaur. c. 4), Ambrose (lib. 5, de Fide , c. 8). 

Maldonatus gives another explanation. He says that Christ, 
even as He is God, knoweth not the Day of Judgment in, as it 
were, an ex officio sense, because it is the office of the Father 
alone to predestinate, decree, and determine the Day of Judg- 
ment; and, by consequence, that He knows it, and reveals it 
when He wills. For providence, in which predestination is 
included, is a special attribute of the Father. But this explana- 
tion is somewhat too subtle and abstruse. 

But as the days of JVoah, &c. Like the Deluge, which suddenly 
and unexpectedly drowned all men, shall My Advent come upon 
alL This is made plain by the subsequent verse.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


As in the days that were before the floods &c. 

Ver. 39. And knew not , &c. You may say, “From the dark- 
ness of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars, and the 
other dreadful signs, men will know that the end of the world is 
near.” As Luke saith, Men's hearts withering with fear y and with 
looking for those things which are coming on the earth . “ Therefore 

the end of the world cannot be unexpected by them.” I reply, 
that after the darkening of the sun and moon, and the other signs, 
God will give a certain space of quietness and peace; and then 
men will forget the signs, and will give themselves up to pleasures, 
to gluttony and lust, even as they did before. Then will God put 
an end to them and to the world, crushing them with a sudden 
destruction. In like manner, dying persons will seem to revive for 
a little while, but soon grow worse and expire. So, too, a candle 
when it is burnt out will flicker up with a last effort before its 
flame, like a breath, departs and is extinguished. Again, so great 
shall be the hardness and the wickedness of the multitude of the 
ungodly at that time, that even though they do behold the sun 
and moon darkened, yet will they apply themselves to the gluttony 
and the luxury to which they have been accustomed, and will not 
think of the end of the world so nigh at the doors. Thus was it 
with Belshazzar, when he was feasting with his lords, on the night 
when he was besieged and slain by Cyrus, until he beheld the 
fateful hand which foretold his destruction by the words, Afeni, 
Tekely Phares. Wherefore S. Augustine teaches that at the end of 
the world, the righteous will be sorrowful on account of these signs, 
but the wicked will indulge their bent, and rejoice. 

Then two shall be in the fields &c. In the Day of Judgment 
Christ will separate companion from companion, neighbour from 
neighbour ; as, for example, husbandman from husbandman. Him 
who has lived justly and piously He will take up with Himself to 
glory. But his companion, who has lived wickedly, He will leave 
in his sins, and condemn to everlasting punishment For as S. 
Ambrose says (in Luke xvii. 35), “He who is taken is carried 
away to meet Christ in the air ; but he who is left is condemned.

ON WATCHING. 


IOI 


Christ says this, that no one may trust to good society merely 
because he lives among the righteous. He would also show how 
exact and searching will be that judgment, which will separate 
father from son, wife from husband, brother from brother.” 

Two women , &c. He instances the same thing in persons 
grinding at a mill. For formerly mills were in use which were not 
turned by wind or water, but by hand. These were worked by male 
and female slaves to grind dour (see Ex, xi. 5). In mola (Vulg.), 
b rp fAvXun, in the place of grindings where was the bakehouse. 

Ver. 42. Watch therefore, &c That is, “ think continually that 
death is certain, but the day of death uncertain. I say the same 
of the Day of Judgment, both that particular judgment which 
comes to every one at death, as well as the general Judgment, 
which shall take place at the end of the world. Wherefore prepare 
yourselves for both by giving heed to virtue and good works.” 
For as S. Jerome saith (in Joel, c, iL), “ That which shall happen to 
all in the Day of Judgment is fulfilled in each at the day of death.” 
And S. Augustine ( Epist . 80) says, “ In whatsoever state a man’s 

last day shall find him, in the same state shall the world’s last day 

come upon him ; because as the man dies, so shall he be judged. 
Therefore ought every Christian to watch, lest the coming of the 
Lord find him unprepared. But that day shall find unprepared the 
man whom the last day of his life now shall seize unprepared.” 
Moreover, the reason why God wills that this day should be 

unknown to us is, that the uncertainty may be a never-failing 

stimulus to us in the practice of every virtue. “For,” as S. 
Chrysostom says, “ if men knew surely when they were to die, at 
that time only would they seek to repent.” 

The devil, therefore, in order that he may take away this stimulus 
of uncertainty, gets rid of it by degrees, and in part He persuades 
every one that they have at least one year to live. When that 
has come to an end, he tells them they have another, and so on 
interminably. He causes men to believe themselves so strong and 
well, that they can surely live this one year. Year by year he does 
this, and puts such a thought into their minds as, “You are in

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


very good health ; you will not die this year.” Thus it comes to 
pass that being, as it were, certain of life, they neglect repentance 
from year to year, deferring it to the year in which they are to die. 
Wherefore, when that year comes to each in which it is God’s 
decree that they shall die, they, in like manner, persuade them- 
selves that they will not die in it Thus it comes to pass that they 
are always unprepared when certain death and the last day over- 
take them. Wherefore this idea, instigated by the devil, must be 
crushed. Every one should say to himself at the beginning of each 
year, of each day, “It may be that thou shalt die this year 
or this day. Therefore so live as if thou wert to die to-day." 
This was the advice which S. Anthony was wont to give to his 
disciples, as S. Athanasius testifies, “ When we awake out of sleep, 
let us be in doubt whether we shall see the evening. When we 
lay us down to rest, let us not be confident that we shall come to 
the light of another day. Thus we shall not offend, nor be carried 
away by vain desires. Neither shall we be angry, nor covet to lay 
up earthly treasures. But rather by the fear of departure, from day 
to day we shall trample upon all transitory things." Barlaam also 
taught the same to his Josaphat, “Think that this day thou hast 
begun the religious life. Think that this day also thou wilt finish 
it" S. Jerome says, “So live as though thou shouldst die to-day; 
so study as though thou wert to live always.” The same Father 
(Ep. 1 6, ad Principiam) says that Marcella was wont to praise that 
saying of Plato, “that philosophy was a meditation upon death;" 
and the precept of the Satirist, “ Live mindful of death : time flies." 
She therefore so lived as though she always believed herself at the 
point of death. When she put on her clothes, she remembered 
the grave, offering herself to God as a reasonable, living, accept- 
able sacrifice. 

Ver. 43. But know this , &c. Here we must supply what is to 
be understood, somewhat as follows: But forasmuch as a man 
knows not this hour, and is not willing or able to watch at every 
hour, therefore the thief, as his manner is, comes at the hour in 
which he thinks the householder is not watching, but sleeping, and

so robs his house while he is asleep. It is clear that this is the 
meaning from the Greek, which has in the past tense, If the 
master of the house had known in what hour the thief would come y 
he would have watched \ and would not have suffered his house to be 
broken through. You must supply, “ But because he did not know 
the hour, he did not watch, and did suffer his house to be broken 
into and robbed.” 

By the thief S. Hilary understands the devil \ “ The thief,” he 

says, “shows that the devil is very watchful to take from us our 
goods, and to plot against the houses of our souls, that he may dig 
through them whilst we are careless, and given up to the sleep of 
our own devices ; and he would pierce through them with the darts 
of enticements. It behoves us, therefore, to be prepared, because 
ignorance of the day sharpens the intense solicitude of expectation 
ever suspended” But it is better to apply the words to Christ 
For so He Himself explains, applying this parable of the thief to 
Himself in the following verse. 

Be ye also ready , &c. . . . the Son oj man shall come , to 
judgment, both the particular judgment of your own soul, and 
the general Judgment of all men at the end of the world Christ 
therefore compares Himself to a thief not as regards the act 
of stealing, but as regards silence and secrecy, in that the thief 
chooses the hour in which he thinks the householder will be 
absent or asleep, that so he may come upon him unawares, and 
rob his house. In like manner Christ summons those who are 
careless, and not waiting for Him, to death and judgment. Whence 
the Apocalypse warns every one saying, “Behold, I come as a 
thief” (xvl 15). And S. Paul (1 Thess. v. 4) says, “But ye, 
brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as 
a thief. Ye are all children of the light, and of the day.” Truly 
hath the wise man said, “ The life of mortals is a vigiL” 

The truth of this sentence of Christ is seen in daily experience. 
For we see very many men seized by death at a time when they 
think themselves to be in good health, and are forming grand 
projects in their minds. They think death is far distant, and

promise themselves many years of life. And yet both experience 
and the warning of Christ should teach them to do the very 
opposite. When they appear to themselves to enjoy the most 
perfect health, they should think that death is lying hid at the 
very threshold of their doors, and should believe that they are 
then about to die when thoughts and hopes of long life are 
suggested to them, either by the devil or their own concupiscence. 
So would the day of death never come upon them unawares, nor 
overtake them as a thief. 

Thus did the wise and holy men of whom we read in the Lives 
of the Fathers (lib. 5, libello 3, de Compunc . n. 2). Abbot Ammon 
gives this precept of salvation to a certain person, “Entertain 
such thoughts as evil-doers who are in prison have. For these 
men ask, ‘Where is the judge, and when will he come?* And 
they weep in expectation of their punishments. After this manner 
ought a monk to do. He should ever be chiding his soul, and 
saying, ‘Woe is me, who have to stand before the judgment-seat 
of Christ, to render unto Him an account of all my deeds.* For 
if thou wilt always meditate thus, thou wilt be safe.” And Abbot 
Evagrius said, “ That is divine, to picture the dreadful and terrible 
judgment Consider the confusion which is laid up for sinners, 
which they shall endure in the presence of Christ and God, 
before angels, and archangels, and powers, and all men. Think 
of the everlasting fire, the undying worm, the blackness of 
hell; and in addition to all these things, the gnashing of teeth 
the fears and torments. Consider likewise the good things which 
are laid up for the righteous — confidence before God the Father 
and Christ His Son, and before the angels. Consider the heavenly 
Kingdom and its gifts of joy and rest” And Abbot Elias saith, 
“I am afraid of three things — the first, the going forth of my 
soul from the body; the second, when I shall meet God; the 
third, when sentence shall be pronounced against me.” Abp. 
Theophilus, of holy memory, said, when he was about to die, 
“ Elessed art thou, O Abbot Arsenius, because thou always hadst 
this hour before thine eyes.” In the same work we read that

a certain old man sav one laughing, and said to him, “We 
have to give an account of our whole life before the Lord of 
heaven and earth, and dost thou laugh ? ” 

Ver. 45- Who then is a faithful and wise servant , &c Who then t 

Gr. r/c aga ; Vulg. Who thinkest thou l At first sight there might 
seem to be a hiatus here, or a question without an answer. But 
it is not so. The sentence should be disposed as follows: 
“Who, thinkest thou, is the faithful and prudent servant, whom 
the Lord hath set over His family, to give them of His household 
food in due season?” He assuredly is faithful and prudent who 
performs that for which he is appointed, who does give every 
member of the family their food in due time. He distributes, that 
is, to the servants and domestics, their proper portion of victuals, 
as the price of their labours. For in ancient times, when money 
was scarce, the wages of servants were paid in rations of food. 

This saying of Christ has special reference to Bishops and 
Pastors. For on them it is incumbent to feed the Church, which 
is their family, indeed Christ’s family, that they should distribute 
the food of holy doctrine according to the capacity of every one 
to receive it Wherefore it behoves them to be vigilant in this 
matter, prudent, and faithful. Thus, S. Hilary saith, “Although 
He exhorts every one of us in common to betake ourselves to 
unwearied watchfulness, yet He gives a special charge of solici- 
tude to the princes of the people, that is, to the Bishops, in 
expectation of His Advent For He signifies that he is a faithful 
servant, and a prudent overseer of His family, who is careful 
about the profit of the people committed to his charge; who 
hears the word and obeys it ; who in opportunity of doctrine and 
truth strengthens the weak, establishes the fallen, converts the 
depraved, and dispenses the word of life as the eternal food for 
nourishing the family.” 

This question, Who thinkest thout intimates that such ser- 
vants, such Bishops and Pastors as are wholly faithful to Christ 
in the care of His flock, are few. Whence the saying of S. 
Jerome, “Priests many, Priests few.” Also that of S. Boniface,

S. MATTHEW, C. XXIV. 


Apostle of Germany, and Martyr, “ Formerly Priests of gold cele- 
brated in chalices of wood; now Priests of wood celebrate in 
chalices of gold.” 

Blessed is that servant ... so doing: that is, assiduously and 
continually until death, and the day of particular judgment, and 
so, by consequence, of the general Judgment, namely, that he 
should distribute to all the faithful of his Church such food as 
is suitable for each, the word and Sacraments, especially the 
Holy Eucharist, to nourish their souls in faith and piety. Blessed 
therefore is the Bishop who doth this, because, not only on 
account of his own holiness shall he receive of Christ the crown 
of righteousness, but shall obtain as many crowns as there are 
faithful people whom he has nourished and profited, according to 
the w'ords of Daniel, “They that instruct many to justice shall 
shine as the stars for perpetual eternities ” (Vulg.). 

Ver. 47. Amen, i.e., Verily I say , &c. He alludes to the sa- 
vant who, because of his merit in faithfully and prudently ruling 
his master's household, deserves to be exalted by him and set 
over all his goods, so as to enjoy them as an associate and 
companion, and almost like an equal of his master. Such was 
Joseph, who was set by Pharaoh to preside over Egypt, and was 
virtually king of Egypt (Gen. xli. 10). In like manner will God 
bless prudent and faithful Bishops, who have ruled well their 
flocks, and have guided them to everlasting salvation. He will 
bestow upon them greater glory than He will upon private 
believers. He will cause them to preside, not only over them, 
but He will make them kings and lords of the whole universe. 
Thus Remigius says, “ He will make the good hearers to sit down, 
as Luke saith : the good preachers He will set over all His goods. 
For as the difference of merits is great, so also is the difference 
in rewards.” This is what is spoken of in Apoc. iv. 10, “The 
four and twenty Elders,” Bishops and Prelates, “cast their 
crowns before Him that sitteth on the Throne and worshipped 
Him that liveth for ever, saying unto the Lamb,” that is, to Christ, 
“Thou hast made us unto God a Kingdom and Priests, and we

shall reign for ever and ever.” What I have said of Bishops 
applies to every father of a family, for he is, as it were, a bishop 
of his own house; and as S. Augustine saith, every faithful soul 
is a bishop of himself 

In the life of S. Amandus, who flourished about A.D. 870, 
and who converted Sclavonians and many other tribes to Christ, 
it is related, that at the very hour when he departed this life, 
he appeared to S. Aldegonde in glory, encompassed with a white- 
robed throng. And when she knew not what it meant, she 
heard an angel saying, 11 Amandus, the man of God, has passed 
in glory to celestial joys. The white-robed throng are they who 
by means of his earnest preaching have been enrolled as citizens 
of Heaven, and from henceforth he shall appear as a prince over 
them for ever.” Among the more illustrious of his disciples were 
S. Landvald, S. Bavo, S. Amantius, S. Gertrude, S. Maurontus, 
and many others. 

Over all His goods ; Gr. over all the things which belong to 
Himself. The good things of God are twofold, viz., 1st. Things 
external and created, as Heaven and earth, and all creatures 
contained in them. So Origen. ad. Things internal and un- 
created — such are His infinite majesty, goodness, wisdom, power, 
and glory. For God is, as it were, an infinite ocean of all good 
things; and over them all He will appoint His faithful servant 
His bishop and pastor. He will make him to rule, as it were, 
not only over all creatures, but also over all the immense and 
infinite goodness which God contains in Himself, that he may 
enjoy them with God, and be blessed and glorified for ever. For 
if Jacob, wrestling with the angel of God, and overcoming Him, 
willing to be overcome, was called Israel, “ruling God M * 

Gen. xxxii. 28), much rather shall blessed Bishops, by their own 
virtue, as it were, overcoming God, be called and become Israels, 
that is, “rulers of God,” that “they may have these eternal 
rewards, both because of their own life, as well as for their care

“lord of God.”

of their flocks,” as Rabanus says. For in that they have rightly 
presided over the flock of God, they have therefore deserved 
that they should, in a certain sense, through God’s wonderful 
condescension, be appointed over the good things of God, and 
even over Himself, For God makes Himself over to them, as 
their peculiar possession, as it is said in the 16th Psalm, “The 
Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.” 

But if that evil savant, />., such a servant as has been set by 
his master over his household, shall say , &c. It means, “If a 
Bishop shall think, ‘The day of death and judgment is far away: 
wherefore I will abuse my life and my office for the purposes of 
luxury and ambition.* ** Therefore He adds — 

Ver. 49. And shall begin to smite his fellow-servants , &c. To 
smite, Le., unjustly. For, as saith Auetor Itnperf., “He who smites 
for just causey even if he smite, does not seem to smite. For as 
righteous anger is not anger, but diligence; so just smiting is 
not smiting, but correction. Thus a father and a master smite 
their sons and pupils for the sake of correcting them.” 

Christ here intimates that there are two capital vices of Pre- 
lates, from which all their other faults take their rise. They are, 
imperious and tyrannical audacity, and a seeking after pleasures, 
gluttony, and luxury. This is why S. Peter admonishes Pastors 
and Bishops (1 Pet v. 2) thus, “ Feed the flock of God, which is 
among you, providing for them not by constraint, but sponta- 
neously, according to God; neither for filthy lucre’s sake, but 
voluntarily ; neither as lording it over the clergy, but as affording 
examples of their actions to the flock from the heart And when 
the Prince of the Shepherds shall appear, ye shall receive the 
un withering crown of glory.” 

The Lord . . . shall come . . . when he looketh not; Vulg. non 
sperat, hopeth not, expecteth not Thus Virgil, in the First i£neid, 
“Hope,” that is, fear, “that the gods take note of right and 
wrong.” 

And shall cut him asunder ; Gr. ^oro/A^c/, cut in twain , i.e., 
soul and body in death, and after death, by sending the soul to

hell and the demons, and the body to the tomb and the worms, 
“ He shall divide ,” says S. Jerome, “not by cutting him in two 
with a sword, but by severing him from the company of the 
Saints.” It means that not only shall Christ remove such a 
Bishop from his office, but shall separate him from the company 
of the Blessed, and deliver him to the devil to be tormented 
for ever. 

With the hypocrites , Le., slothful servants , who, like hypocrites, 
serve only the eyes of their masters. As soon as they are out 
of their master’s sight, they indulge in sleep and drunkenness, 
and so shall be sent to the prison-house of hell, which is the 
proper place for the slothful. Thus in Proverbs, passim, , a 
hypocrite signifies a wicked man, who serves God slothfully, but 
his own lusts fervently. There is an allusion to Job viii. 13, “The 
hope of the hypocrite shall perish.” 

Christ has shown that it is the duty of every believer to 
watch, that by good works he may prepare himself for the certain 
coming of the Lord to judgment, forasmuch as the time is un- 
certain, lest that day should come upon him unawares. This He 
showed: 1st By the example of the Deluge, which drowned the 
world at unawares (ver. 37). ad. By the parable of the house- 
holder, who watches that he may repel the thief, who comes by 
night, at a time unexpected (ver. 43). 3rd. By the parable of 
the servants, one faithful, the other unfaithful; the one of whom 
receives from his master an ample reward, the other severe 
chastisement (ver. 45). 4th. In the following chapter (ver. 1), by

CHAPTER XXV. 

I The parable of the ten virgins , 14 and of the talents . 31 Also the description 
of the last judgment '. 

'T'HEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins 9 which took 
A their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 

2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 

3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them : 

4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept 

6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh ; 
go ye out to meet him. 

7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 

8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are 
gone out 

9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us 
and you : but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 

10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came ; and they that were 
ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut 

1 1 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 

12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not 

13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the 
Son of man cometh. 

14 IT For the kingdom of heaven if as a man travelling into a far country, who 
called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 

15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one s 
to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his 
journey. 

16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, 
and made them other five talents. 

17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two, 

18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his 
lord’s money. 

19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with 
them.

20 And *o he that had received five talents came and brought other five 
talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have 
gained beside them five talents more. 

21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant ; thou 
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things : 
enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst 
unto me two talents : behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 

23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant ; thou hast 
been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things : enter 
thou into the joy of thy lord. 

24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew 
thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering 
where thou hast not strawed : 

25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo, there thou 
hast that is thine. 

26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, 
thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not 
strawed : 

27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and 
then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 

28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten 
talents. 

29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance : 
but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. 

30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

31 Y When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels 
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory : 

32 And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them 
one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. 

33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left 

34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of 
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world : 

35 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty, and ye gave 
me drink : I was a stranger, and ye took me in : 

36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in 
prison, and ye came unto me. 

37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee 
an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink ? 

38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in ? or naked, and clothed theet 

39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee ? 

40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, 
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye 
have done it unto me. 

41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye 
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels : 

42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty, and ye 
gave me no drink ;

43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in : naked, and ye clothed me not :

44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an 
hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not 
minister unto thee ? 

45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as 
ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 

46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous 
into life eternal. 

Then . . . which went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride 
( Vulg .). And the bride is not found in the Greek, nor in S. 
Chrysostom. It is the reading of the Latin and the Syriac ver- 
sions, and of Origen, Hilary, and S. Augustine (Epist. 120). 

Then : when Christ shall return unexpectedly to judgment. 

The Kingdom of Heaven ; that is, the Church militant, which 
shall then be about to triumph. The meaning is, “At that time 
shall it be with members of the Church as if ten virgins were 
preparing themselves for a marriage feast For although the 
damned, as being already in hell, are no longer members of 
the Church, yet because they were members of it in this life, 
they are brought to hear the sentence of the Judge. There is 
no mention of unbelievers here, because, as S. John says, “He 
that believeth not is judged already.” 

Observe, that formerly, as now, youths were assigned to the 
bridegroom, to do him honour, and virgins to the bride; and 
these last were often ten in number. Moreover, they were 
accustomed to celebrate weddings at night Then the bride- 
groom came about evening to the house of the bride. There he 
was honourably and joyfully received in the house of the parents 
of the bride. From thence he conducted his bride to his own 
house, or, if it proved too small, to the larger mansion of the 
nuptial feast : and there he kept his wedding. Both the youths 
and the virgins, carrying torches, most frequently made of white 
thorn, and five in number, went out to meet the bride and bride- 
groom, to do them honour. So Plutarch testifies (in Problem.). 
The Jews do not seem, anciently, to have made use of wax-lights 
or torches, but of oil lamps. This is why there is constant

mention in Scripture of lamps and lanterns, never of candles. 
Even in the candlestick in the Temple there were lamps with 
oil, not candles made of wax or fat 

As to the particular application of the parable, Christ is the 
Bridegroom^ the Church the Bride \ whose espousals take place 
in this life, but the eternal Marriage shall be in the future glory 
of the Resurrection. The virgins are all believers or all Christians. 
They are called virgins because they are sound in the faith. 

S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, S. Augustine, and S. Gregory 
understood by virgins only those and all who are literally so. 
But this is too narrow and restricted an interpretation. Rightly, 
nevertheless, does the Church in the Divine Office apply the 
words to Virgin r, because they bear a literal application to them 
above others. So Jansen, Maldonatus, and others. So B. 
Anatolia, betrothed to Aurelian, beheld an angel, who cried 
aloud to her, “O virginity, which shall not be overcome of 
death ! O virginity, who art not occupied in the works of dark- 
ness, but art ever in the light ! Virginity is the royal purple, which 
whoso putteth on, is more glorious than others. Virginity is a 
precious jewel. Virginity is the immense treasure of the King. 
For it thieves are lying in wait. Do thou watch, and guard it care- 
fully. Forasmuch as thou knowest thou hast more, so much the 
more keep it, lest thou lose it.” So Ado in Marty rolog, ,, Dec. 21. 

Ten virgins are spoken o£ because the number ten is the symbol 
of totality. 

“They took their nuptial lamps, kindled,” says Origen; “but 
for so great a journey to go out to meet the Bridegroom, they 
took no oil to keep them alight.” “For when they complain,” 
says S. Jerome, “that their lamps were going out, they show 
that they were partly alight.” 

Moreover, in Scripture, lappidim , lamps , mean torches, such 
as are used at weddings and for other purposes. These nuptial 
torches ( tcedce ) are wont to be carried at night before a bride- 
groom and bride, because they will stand against the wind, when 

lamps would be immediately extinguished. Those, however,

spoken of in the parable where lamps, properly so called, because 
mention is made of oil. They belonged to virgins , as torches 
to men. Thus Virgil says in the 4th Eclogue, 

“Cut, O Mopsas, new torches : it is your wedding day.* 

And Pliny says, “ The thorn, most auspicious for wedding 
torches, is an accompaniment of the same rites, because the 
shepherds, who carried off the Sabine maids, made use of them 
for that purpose ” (lib. 16, c. 18). 

Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent (Vulg.). 
Foolish, because they acted foolishly and imprudently ; for when 
they went out to meet the Bridegroom with burning lamps, they 
neglected to take the necessary oil for keeping the lamps alight 
But the prudent, &c. In the first place, SS. Jerome and 
Hilary by the virgins understand all mankind; by the foolish, 
Jews and heretics ; by the prudent, Christians. 

ad. On the contrary, S. Chrysostom and others already cited 
consider that virgins only are to be understood; of whom the 
prudent are they who, with virginity, have the oil of charity ; the 
foolish, they who are without it 

3d. Lyra says, “The prudent virgins are Contemplatives and 
Religious, who have the oil of charity and a right disposition. 
The foolish are those who lack the oil, and who hunt for the 
vain praise and glory of men.” 

4th and last. The virgins are all believers. The prudent are 
those who have faith together with works of mercy, charity, and 
other virtues: the foolish, who have faith alone without good 
works. So Origen, Hilary, Auctor Imperfectu 

Thus their lamps are dying out, yea, as the Syriac hath it, 
they have been extinguished; according to the words of S. James, 
“Faith without works is dead.” The lamp, therefore, is the 
faithful mind, or faith itself. The oil is good works, without which 
faith is dead, and, as it were, extinct; but with them, alive and 
burning. The light, or flame of the lamps, is charity. For this 
is fed by zeal for good works, just as the flame of a lamp is

fed with oiL The vessel is conscience, or the believing souL And 
this is the reason why we place a lighted candle in the hands of 
dying persons, denoting, or at least praying, that they may have 
faith with works, that like brides with burning lamps, they may 
worthily meet Christ the Lord, as it were their Bridegroom. 

But while the Bridegroom tarried , &c. ; Gr. xi ovt Z otroi - Whilst 
Christ the Bridegroom delays to come, is the opportunity for 
repentance and good works, which He grants to every one in 
this life. Therefore does He delay the time of death and 

judgment To slumber is to die. To sleep is to be dead. The 
meaning is, Whilst Christ defers the Day of Judgment, meanwhile 
the faithful begin to die one after another, and at length all are 
dead. Thus S. Hilary, “The delay of the Bridegroom is the time 
of repentance. The sleep of them that wait is the rest of believers. 
And in the time of repentance is the temporal death of all men.” 

And at midnight \ &c. The Arabic is, It was midnight \ and a 
voice cried out. This was the voice of the companions of the 
Bridegroom, who went before him, as he was bringing his bride 
* from her house, and drawing nigh his own. This cry denotes the 
archangel’s trump, which awakes the dead, of which I have spoken 
in the previous chapter. 

It was to this S. Laurence Justinian, the first patriarch of 
Venice, was alluding, when he said in dying, “Up till now, 
children, all has been jest : now it is earnest indeed. The Bride- 
groom is at hand; we must go to meet Him.” Then lifting up 
his eyes to Heaven, he said, “I come to Thee, O good Jesu. 
This day have I ever had before mine eyes. Thou, Lord, knowest.” 
Then, with joyful countenance, he rendered up his pure soul to 
God, going to meet Christ in Heaven. 

From this which is here said, that this cry is made at midnight \ 
SS. Chrysostom, Jerome, and Euthymius think it probable that 
the second Advent of Christ will take place at midnight, and 
come upon men sleeping and unawares. S. Jerome says that this 
was an Apostolic tradition, and that this was the reason why 
formerly at Easter the people were not allowed to depart out of

Church before midnight; because, as in the olden time, Christ 
came into Egypt at midnight to destroy the first-born, and deliver 
the Hebrews; so it was believed that Christ would come at the 
same time to judge all men. But this is a doubtful matter. For 
others, with equal, or even greater probability, think that Christ will 
come in the morning. For He is the Father of light, and He will 
execute His judgment openly in the light before the whole world, 
so that there shall be no place of darkness in which to take refuge. 
What is meant therefore by midnight is, that Christ the Judge 
shall come when men are not thinking of it, when they are, as it 
were, sleeping. 

Ver. 7. Then all those virgins , &c. At the sound of the Arch- 
angel’s trumpet, all Christians shall rise, and shall be anxious with 
what mind and conscience they shall go to the Judge. As Auctor 
Imperfecti says, “They shall examine their faith, they shall consider 
their works, they shall interrogate their conscience.” “For,” as 
S. Augustine says ( Serm . 23, de Verbis Dom.\ “they began to 
trim their lamps, means nothing else but to prepare to render an 
account of their works to God. But S. Hilary says, “The taking 
up the lamps is the return of the soul to the body ; the light is a 
bright conscience of good works, which is, as it were, contained 
in the vessel of the body.” 

S. Montanus and his fellow-martyrs, disciples of S. Cyprian, 
received in a vision a warning from God of their martyrdom by 
means of lamps. “One of them, whose name was Reno, saw 
them, in his sleep, led out one by one. As they came forth, 
lamps were given to each. And no one came forth without a 
lamp going before him. And when we had come forth with our 
lamps, he awoke, and related to us the dream. Then were we 
glad, trusting that we should walk with Christ, who is a lantern to 
our feet, and the Word of God. Immediately afterwards we were 
dragged before the procurator.” (See their Acta in Surias, Feb. 24.) 

Ver. 8. But the foolish, &c This belongs to the emblema of the 
parable. For, with reference to what is signified by it, the reprobate 
in the Day of Judgment will not ask for the oil of good works from

the elect; for they will know that they will neither give nor be 
able to give it to them. For then shall every one be judged by 
the works which he hath done in this life before death. This 
emb/ema, then, is introduced to express that the repentance of the 
reprobate will be too late, when, after death, they behold the 
dreadful judgment of God hanging over them. Too late will they 
grieve that they in this life neglected goodness. Too late will they 
wish that they had loved virtue. But it will be in vain. They 
will not be able to procure either the works or the help of the 
elect. For there will be neither time for working, nor the help 
and prayers of the Saints. Yea, in that terrible judgment, there 
will be no one who will appear to have any confidence in himself, 
or in good works. 

Our lamps are gone out In truth they were extinguished, be- 
cause they had died in a state of mortal sin. Yet they say, are 
going out ( extinguuntur\ because in this life their souls seemed, 
through their common profession of the true faith, and through 
participation of the Sacraments, to be alive. But then, that is, in 
death and judgment, when all those things are vanishing away, 
they will see that they are extinct. S. Augustine says (Serm. 23, 
de Verb. Domini ), “Before those virgins slept, it is not said that 
their lamps were being extinguished. Wherefore, then, were they 
alight ? It was because they did not lack the praise of men. But 
in the presence of the Bridegroom, that is, Christ the Judge, they 
will be extinguished, because Christ will illuminate the hidden 
things of darkness, and then shall every one have praise of God 
(1 Cor. iv. 5), not of men.” For to the slothful and reprobate 
will be confusion. 

The words are gone out signify that charity, which is the flame 
of the lamps, that is, of souls, is nourished by good works, as 
by oiL When, therefore, they are withdrawn, it is extinguished. 
This is because many virtuous works are commanded by God, 
such as are all those which are commanded in the Decalogue. 
I£ therefore, any one does not fulfil what God has commanded, he 
loses the grace and love of God. For charity, without the exercise

S. MATTHEW, C. XXV. 


of good works, fades and languishes. And then, when any tempta- 
tion attacks him, a man easily glides into mortal sin, by which 
charity is extinguished. Dost thou wish then to secure the grace 
of God, yea, to grow in the friendship and love of God ? Be thou 
very earnest in all good works. For by these charity is constantly 
nourished and strengthened. It grows and increases. 

Ver. 9. The wise answered \ & c. The Arabic is, we have not 

enough . S. Augustine says of these words of the prudent virgins, 
"This is not the answer of persons giving advice, but of those who 
decide. For they were not wise of themselves, but the wisdom in 
them was that of which it is written (Prop. i. 24), ‘ Because I called, 
and ye refused ... I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock 
when your fear cometh, when that whereof ye were afraid cometh 
upon you.’” And as S. Jerome says upon this passage, “In the 
Day of Judgment no one’s virtues will be able to give any assistance 
to other men’s faults.” And the Interlinear Gloss adds, “The 
wise say this not from covetousness, but from fear. For in that 
day the testimony of each shall scarcely suffice for himself, much 
less for himself and his neighbour also.” S. Gregory adds, “The 
sellers of oil are flatterers. For they who, when any favour has 
been received, offer with their vain praises the brightness of glory, 
sell, as it were, oil This is the oil of which the Psalmist says, 
‘Let not the oil of the sinner make fat my head’” (Vulg.). 

But whilst they were going . . . with him to the marriage \ Syr. to 
the house of the choir , because at weddings there were choirs of 
singers and dancers. This, too, is a figure of speech, signifying 
that in this life is the time for repentance and good works. And 
this time is ended by death. “For,” says S. Augustine, “after 
judgment there is no place open for prayers or merits.” And 
Origen says, “They who, when they ought to have learned what 
was profitable, neglected to do so, at the close of life, when 
they wish to learn, are seized by death.” He adds that they who 
sell are Teachers; buying is receiving: the price is perseverance. 
Moreover, because marriage joy is, among men, the chief of all, 
the celestial happiness of the elect is here likened to it Wherefore

THE FOOLISH VIRGINS. 


1 19 

S. Hilary says, 44 Marriage is the putting on of immortality, when 
the soul is united to the Word of God as her Bridegroom.” 

Hear what S. Adelinus relates of S. Opportuna, the Abbess. 
44 When S. Opportuna was very sick, there came to her SS. Cecilia 
and Lucy. 4 Hail, Cecilia and Lucy, my sisters/ she cried ; 4 what 
does the Virgin Mary, the Queen of all, bid her handmaid do?" 

* She is awaiting/ they answer, 4 your presence in Heaven, that you 
may be united to her Son. Therefore you must be decked with 
a crown of glory, and meet, with burning lamp, the Bridegroom 
and the Bride.' When, therefore, she beheld the Virgin coming 
to her, and, as it were, embracing her, she gave up her spirit into 
her hands, to be beatified with everlasting glory.” 

But, last cf all, come the other virgins, & c. (Vulg.). “But what 
does it profit,” says S. Jerome, 44 to invoke with your voice Him 
whom you deny by your works?” It means, then, that the 
reprobate will, at that time, be struck with the utmost anxiety and 
terror, and turn themselves in every direction, now with prayers 
imploring mercy of the Judge, now deploring the negligence of 
their life past, now giving up hope of salvation. As Auctor Imper » 
fecti says, “There will be no profit in the confession, forced by 
necessity, of him who never once voluntarily confessed.” Read 
the pathetic wailings of the reprobate, graphically depicted by the 
wise man ( Wisdom v. 1, &c.). 

Ver. 12. But He answered \ &c. “ I do not acknowledge you as 
mine. Because ye, in your day, would not acknowledge Me as 
your Lord and your God, neither will I, in this My day, acknow- 
ledge you as My faithful sons and servants. Ye have served the 
devil in pleasure, now serve him in hell.” Hear S. Chrysostom : 
“ When He shall say, 4 1 know you not/ nothing is left but hell and 
intolerable torment. Yea, verily that word is more dreadful than 
hell.” For whom God knows not, Heaven knows not, the Angels 
and the Blessed know not ; but the devil knows him, death knows 
him, hell knows him. Consider that Christ, in the Day of Judg- 
ment, will show so terrible a countenance to the reprobate that 
( Apoc . vi. 16, 17) they will say “to the mountains and rocks, Fall

on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the Throne, 
and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of His wrath 
is come ; and who shall be able to stand ? ” 

Watch ye therefore , &c. These words give the scope or aim and 
application of the parable, namely, that its object is to stimulate all 
the faithful to watchfulness and zeal for good works, by means of 
which they may prepare themselves for the day of death and judg- 
ment, which is at once imminent and uncertain. As S. Gregory 
says, “Forasmuch as ye know not the day of judgment, prepare 
the light of good works. For He who has guaranteed pardon to 
the penitent has not promised to-morrow to the sinner” (. Horn . 12, 
in Evang.). 

Wisely says R. Achabia (in Pirke Avoth ), “ Consider three things 
that thou mayest not sin. First, from whence thou comest. 
Second, whither thou goest. Third, to whom thou shalt render 
an account of thy life. From whence comest thou ? From fetid 
matter. Whither goest thou ? To the place of ashes and worms. 
To whom shalt thou render an account ? To the King of kings, 
the Holy and the Blessed.” Still more wisely says S. Augustine, 
“God has promised thee that in the day thou art converted, He will 
forget thy past sins ; but He has never promised thee a to-morrow. 
God hath wisely made the day of death uncertain. Let every 
man, for his profit, think upon his last day. It is of the mercy 
of God that man knoweth not when he shall die. The last day 
lies hid, that all days may be watched.” Mark well this last sen- 
tence of S. Augustine. 

Ver. 14. For as a man going into a far country , &c. (Vulg.). 
Supply from what precedes, So shall be the coming of the Son of Man 
to judgment. The word for denotes the scope of the parable. By 
it Christ would prove what He said in the verse before, Watch ye 
therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour. 

The object of the parable is to show how exact an account 
Christ will require from the slothful in the Day of Judgment; and 
how great will be the reward which He will give to the diligent, 
who have carefully used His gifts to the glory of God. The

PARABLE OF THE TALENTS. 


121 


parable is similar to that which Luke records (xix. n), but with 
some differences. For they were spoken by Christ at different 
times, and with different objects. The parable in Luke was 
spoken before Palm Sunday ; but this in S. Matthew after it, on 
the Tuesday before Good Friday. Hence S. Chrysostom, Euthy- 
mius, Jansen, and others think they are different parables, or 
rather, the same parable told in different ways. For instead of 
talents , Luke has mince. 

Now the man here spoken of is Christ. For Christ went a long 
journey when He ascended into Heaven, being about to be absent 
a long time from earth and His Church. So Origen, Jerome, Bede. 
Others think that Christ's going far off ( peregre ) means His trans- 
ference of the preaching of the gospel from the Jews to the Gentiles 
by means of the Apostles, and His founding the kingdom of His 
Church amongst them. And this applies well to the relation of 
the parable by S. Luke, where it is introduced with reference to 
Zacchseus, a publican, and, as it were, a Gentile, to whose house 
Christ, leaving the Jews, brought salvation. But in such a case 
the whole parable of the servants and the talents would have to be 
restricted to the Jews. For the Master is here said to have dis- 
tributed His talents before He went His long journey, — that is to 
say, to the Gentiles. Wherefore the former explanation is of wider 
scope, and so more true. By the servants all the faithful are to be 
understood, whether Jews or Gentiles. Talents are goods, either 
because the Master, like merchants and chapmen, had all His 
goods in money — in talents of gold and silver ; or else because 
revenues and estates are called talents , which were valued, some at 
one talent, some at two, some at five talents. In like manner, in 
Latin, whatever is bought or valued for money is called money. 

And to one he gave , &c. Instead of talents, Luke has mnas , 
or tninas. Mna in Hebrew signifies numbered or defined , with 
reference to value, or weight of gold or silver. The root is 
mana , he numbered. It is the word used in Daniel v. 25, mene. 
The Hebrew mna was equal to about 2\ pounds. A Hebrew 
talent was equivalent to sixty Hebrew mnas \

S. MATTHEW, C. XXV. 


By talents understand all the gifts of God, without which we can 
do nothing. These gifts are, I say — ist. Of grace, both making 
grateful,* such as faith, hope, charity, virginity, and all the other 
virtues, as well as those of grace given gratis — such as the power 
of working miracles, the Apostolate, the Priesthood, the gift of 
tongues, prophecy, &c. 2d Natural gifts, such as a keen intel- 
lect, a sound judgment, a sound constitution, prudence, industry, 
learning, eloquence. 3d External goods and gifts, as honours, 
riches, rank, &c So S. Chrysostom. For all these things God 
distributes unequally, according to His good pleasure. And with 
this end in view, that each should use them for God’s glory, and 
the good of himself and others. For so He will increase them, 
both by Himself (for all habits grow by use and exercise) and also 
in merit and reward. For to that man there will be added crowns 
and coronets celestial, as of virginity, martyrdom. Moreover, there 
is no man who hath not received one, ay, several of these gifts of 
God, though one hath more, another less. For, as S. Gregory saith 
(Horn, s, in Evang.\ 44 There is no man who can say with truth, 

4 1 have not received a single talent There is nothing of which I 
must give an account’ For to every poor man even this shall be 
reckoned as a talent, that he hath received but a very little.” For 
to many it is a greater gift of God, and more conducive to their 
salvation, that they have poverty rather than wealth, sickness 
and not health, a humble station instead of an exalted one. Let 
us take as instances S. Paul, S. Timothy, S. Onesimus. S. Paul 
received, as it were, five talents or gifts from God, — as the gift of 
tongues, miracles, the apostolate, zeal for souls, power in preaching. 
Timothy received, as it were, two,— knowledge of the Scriptures, 
and the bishopric of Ephesus. But Onesimus one, that is to say, 
zeal to minister to Paul in prison at Rome. By means of this he 
merited many others, as the bishopric of Colosse, the conversion of 
many, and martyrdom. 

* Gratum facimtis . But for a criticism in the Tablet ', I should have thought it 
unnecessary to observe that, in translating gratum by grateful , I use the word in 
the classical and theological sense.

THE GIFTS OF GOD. 


123 


You will ask, in what manner does God distribute these His 
gifts according to every one’s ability (Gr. dum/ntf), power, strength f 
I answer, this is partly an emblema pertaining only to the adorn- 
ment of the parable. For so among men, prudent masters are 
wont to entrust their goods to servants in such a manner that they 
trust more to him who possesses greater prudence and industry, 
less to him who has less. For it is certain, in opposition to the 
Pelagians, that primary grace is not given according to natural 
powers and merits, yea, that there is no natural disposition to grace. 

But, in part, this pertains to the meaning of the parable. For 
favours and stations given gratis , such as magistracies, the epis- 
copate, priesthood, &c., God often confers in accordance with 
natural powers, and does not raise any one to such a condition 
unless he be either suited to it by nature, or unless He Himself 
makes him fit Men do the same when they choose any one for a 
shepherd, a bishop, a prelate. Indeed, when God determines to 
bestow any permanent gift whatsoever upon any one, He first gives 
him the capacity, or natural or supernatural proportional disposi- 
tion or merit, by means of which he becomes suitable for the 
bestowment of this gift, or may make himself fitted for it Thus 
God gave to Moses a zeal on behalf of his nation, that He might 
thereby dispose him to deliver them out of Egypt. So also He 
gave S. Paul a zeal for the Mosaic law, that He might make use of 
him when he was purified for the propagation of the Law of Christ 
So He instilled into SS. Mary Magdalene and Peter an immense 
contrition for sin, that He might, through it, dispose them to an 
immense sanctity. So it is with those whom God chooses and 
destines to virginity, the religious life, martyrdom, mission work in 
India. He first infuses into them a vehement desire, by which they 
fit and prepare themselves for what they have to do. 

Lastly, S. Thomas (1 p. quasi. 62, art. 6) teaches that God has 
distributed to the angels His gifts of grace and glory, according to 
their natural gifts. Those who are more lofty by nature are also 
higher in grace and glory. And he adds, that God deals in like 
fashion with men. For he says, “ This also happens among men.

124 


S. MATTHEW, c. XXV. 


that in proportion to the fervour of their conversion to God, greater 
grace and glory are given them.” Often, indeed, God acts in a 
way the reverse of this, and gives greater gifts of grace to persons 
of weak intellect — to the ignorant and despised — than He does to 
the learned, the witty, and the honourable. Thus He did to S. 
Francis, S. Catherine of Sienna, S. Simeon Stylites, and many 
others. After a like fashion God distributes His gifts of grace, 
freely given, in accordance with His own hidden counsels. For 
many are set in high station who are by no means worthy of it ; 
many are the Priests who are unfit for the Priesthood. And yet, in 
no persons whatsoever are nature and natural endowments a merit, 
or a disposition to grace. 

Wherefore it does not follow from these words of Christ that 
“the gifts of God are conferred upon every man, according to 
the measure of his merit,” according to the charge which Calvin 
calumniously brings against the Catholics. For it is one thing 
to be by nature capable of receiving the gifts of God ; it is another 
thing to merit those gifts. It is one thing to be able to possess 
charity ; it is another thing to possess it This is Prospers teaching 
(lib. 2, de Vocatione Gentium , , c. 2). 

And straightivay took his journey . Luke adds, that Christ, 
before He went away, after dividing the pounds, or talents, 
amongst His servants, said, Make merchandise until I cotne. He 
meant, “ Increase these My talents by labouring diligently all your 
life long, and bring Me what you have gained when I return to 
judgment” By and by he adds, But his citizens hated him, and 
sent a message after him, saying. We will not have this man to 
reign (Tver us. The citizens of Christ are the Jews, who rejected 
Him, who would not acknowledge Him as their King and Messiah, 
who said, “ We have no king but Casar,” as they cried before Pilate 
when they asked that Christ might be crucified. And again, after 
His resurrection, they persecuted the Apostles and Christians who 
preached and spread the kingdom of Christ. Wherefore con- 
cerning the righteous chastisement which came upon the Jews, 
Luke subjoins that Christ said, u Bui those mine enemies , who would

not that I should reign, bring them hither , and slay them before me? 
Christ did this when He slew the Jews by the hands of Titus. 
He will do it yet more in the Day of Judgment, when He will 
punish them with death eternal. 

Ver. 16. Then he . . . jive talents , &c. To gain talents is to 
increase the gifts of God by using and increasing them, especially 
by means of good works, and helping our neighbour to increase 
and multiply the grace of God in ourselves and others. This 
parable intimates that every one ought to co-operate with the grace 
of God with all his might. For example, he who has, as it were, 
five degrees of charity, ought to exercise charity in a corresponding 
degree of intensity. By this means he will gain from God five 
degrees more. Again, by exercising charity thus increased as ten 
degrees, in acts of corresponding intensity, he may gain other ten 
degrees, and possess, as it were, twenty degrees. And so on, 
marvellously doubling and multiplying the gain of his talents, 
that is to say, the degrees of his charity. Let it be, therefore, that 
a man by his charity should gain few or none to Christ by preach- 
ing, yet will he have the same merit and reward of his charity and 
preaching as if he had converted multitudes. The conversion of 
others is not often in our power, but the merit of doing so is 
always in our power. 

Moraliter: S. Gregory says {Horn. 9, in Evang ;), “This passage 
of the Gospel admonishes us anxiously to beware lest we, who 
seem to have received somewhat more than others in this world, 
should, for that reason, be judged more severely by the Maker of 
the world. For in proportion as gifts are increased, so is the 
account to be rendered of the gifts.” 

And likewise he that had received two , &c. This man also, 
by diligently and correspondingly using his talent, that is, co- 
operating with grace, doubled it. 

Ver. 18. But he that had received one . . . hid his loi-cPs money ; 
Arab, buried his lords silver. To bury a talent is, through negli- 
gence and sloth, not to use or exercise the grace bestowed upon 
one. Here observe, that this burying of his talent is ascribed 


Digitized by L^ooQle 



126 


S. MATTHEW, C. XXV. 


to him who only received one talent. This is not because others, 
who have received more, do not often do the same, but in order 
that we may understand that if he, who had only misused his one 
talent, was thus severely punished by his master, far sharper will 
be the Lord’s censure and punishment of those who have misused 
more and greater talents. Wherefore Paul says, “ We exhort you, 
that ye receive not the grace of God in vain” (2 Cor. vl n). 
And again, “ His grace in me was not in vain, but I laboured more 
abundantly than they all” (1 Cor . xv. 10); and, “Woe is me, if 
I preach not the Gospel” 

Let those who do not use genius, learning, prudence, or other 
gifts of God, for their own or others’ benefits, on account of sloth, 
or fear of sinning, or for any similar reason, note this. For of 
them will Christ demand an exact account of these gifts in the 
Day of Judgment Observe also, that those who have received 
few talents, often, through sloth, leave them idle, and, as it were, 
bury them; whilst those who have received more are stimulated 
by them, and either use them rightly and meritoriously, or else 
abuse them to vanity. And these last are punished not so much 
for letting their talents lie idle, as for misusing them! Thus we 
commonly see that those who have great powers of intellect, if 
they do not employ them for good purposes, do so for bad. 

Ver. 19. After a long time, &c. This reckoning Christ makes 
with eveiy one severally at death, and the particular judgment 
He will make it publicly in the general Judgment 

Ver. 20. And he that had received five talents came near, &c. 
Hear how pathetically S. Gregory depicts this scene: “In that 
great examination the whole multitude of the elect and the 
reprobate will be led forth, and it will be shown what each hath 
done. Then Peter will take his stand, with Judaea converted at 
his side. There Paul, with, I might almost say, a converted world 
There will be Andrew with Achaia, John with Asia, Thomas with 
India, which they will bring into the presence of the Judge. 
There will appear all the rams of the Lord’s flock, with the souls 
which were given them for their hire. When, therefore, so many

shepherds with their flocks shall come before the eyes of the 
Eternal Pastor, what shall we, miserable ones, be able to say, if 
we return before the Lord empty, we who have the name of 
pastors, but have no sheep, which we have fed, to present ? ” 

Ver. 21. His lord said unio him^ Well done , &c. Luke has 
(xix. 19), Be thou over five cities . The parable is taken from the 
idea of a king, who is accustomed to reward his faithful servants 
by setting them over many cities. It signifies also that the Saints, 
who use diligently the grace that God gives them, will be sharers 
in the glory and joy of His kingdom, but in greater or less degrees 
according to the labour and merit of each. 

Our Salmeron is of opinion that it is here intimated, and tacitly 
promised, that the Saints in Heaven shall be set by God to preside 
over the places in which they laboured while on earth, so that in 
those places they may heal diseases and work miracles, because they 
have deserved this by their labours. That thus S. James works 
miracles at Compostella and in Spain; S. Dionysius at Paris and 
in Gaul ; S. Ambrose at Milan ; S. Boniface in Germany. 

Vers. 22, 23. He also that had received two talents , &c. The 
Arab, has, And these are the five * talents which I have gained , as 
though the servant showed them, and offered them to his master. 
The same thing is said as in vers. 20 and 21, save that there there 
were five talents, here there are two. For, as S. Jerome says, 
“The Lord does not regard so much the greatness of the gain, 
as the good-will and the desire. And it is possible that he who 
receives two talents, by trading diligently with them, may merit 
more than he who receives five, and uses them in a lukewarm 
manner.” Thus S. Nicolas Tolentinus passed his life in constant 
prayer and the practice of austerities. He used to fast on Mon- 
days, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays on bread and water, 
in honour of the Blessed Virgin, and used to punish himself by 
means of an iron chain. Six months before his death he heard 
daily at vespers angelic songs, which invited him to the marriage

feast of the Lamb in Heaven. Just before his death he was 
filled with a marvellous joy. Being asked the reason, he said, “ My 
Lord Jesus Christ, leaning upon His mother and our father 
Augustine, is saying to me, Well done, good and faithful servant, 
enter into the joy of thy Lord.” Presently joining and lifting 
up his hands, and raising his eyes to the Cross, he said, “Into 
Thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit." And thus with joyful 
countenance he resigned his soul to God, a.d. 1306, on the 10th 
of September. 

Vers. 24, 25. Then he which had received one talent , & c. 
There is an emblem here which only pertains to the embellishment 
of the parable. For this, says Frank Lucas, is the way in which 
lazy servants excuse their idleness, throwing it upon the severity of 
their masters. As if they said, “You are not willing to lose, but 
always want to gain. And if gain is not brought you, you take away 
the property of your poor servants for any reason, or none." 

It is to be observed that the reprobate in the Day of Judgment, 
when they behold the Saints thus rewarded by Christ and them- 
selves sentenced to Gehenna, will, out of despair and madness, in- 
veigh against Christ the Judge, and will shamelessly reproach Him 
for His too great severity, and will impiously and blasphemously 
throw the blame of their damnation upon Him. And thus they, 
in hell, being driven to madness by the severity and eternal dura- 
tion of their torments, will continually blaspheme God, and Christ, 
and the Saints, as though they were the authors of their sufferings, 
directly or indirectly. 

Vers. 26, 27. His lord answered and said unto him , &c. This 
likewise is an emblem, and only signifies how we ought by all means 
to increase the grace of God. Observe that they are called money- 
changers , who make gain by exchange, and by lending and borrow- 
ing. This gain is lawful in the way of exchange and merchandise. 
It is unlawful in the way of lending upon interest, and is the sin 
of usury. Wherefore the Lord in this place does not speak so 
much according to the abstract right of the matter, as parabolically, 
partly because of the common practice of nations (for usury was

allowed in many nations, especially among the Jews, who think 
that God permitted them to exact it from the Gentiles, in Deut 
xxiii. 19), partly as a deduction from the words of the slothful 
servant, who attributed to his master the avarice of extorting 
money, by fair means or foul, from himself or others. This 
passage may, however, be accommodated to what is signified by 
the parable in the following manner — that God requires of us 
interest, as it were, for His gifts and graces, but that He will 
render us far greater interest of glory in Heaven. Hence the 
saying, “If thou wilt lend, lend unto God.” Also it is said in 
Prov. (xix. 17), “He that hath mercy upon the poor lendeth unto 
the Lord ; and what he layeth out it shall be paid him again.” 

Ver. 28. Take from him the talent , &c. This, too, is only an 
emblem. The Lord throws back the charge of avarice, with which 
the slothful servant accused him. It is as if he said, “ Thou seest, 

0 thou slothful servant, that I do not covetously seek this gain 
for myself, but for my servants. When I take back the talent 
which I gave to thee, I do not put it away in a chest for myself. 

1 bestow it upon him who used his five talents so well, that he 
gained five other talents with them. He therefore deserves this 
talent of yours, or rather mine, as a recompense of his labour 
and merit” 

But besides the emblematic character of these words, they are 
also partly applicable to the thing signified by the parable. For, 
in the Day of Judgment, God will actually take away His graces 
from the reprobate, who have misused them. He often does the 
same thing even in this life. Indeed, He always takes away from 
a man the grace which makes him pleasing in the eyes of God, 
when that man sins mortally, as when, for instance, he, through 
sloth, neglects to perform some commandment of God, which is 
binding under the penalty of mortal sin. But this which is added, 
Give it to him that hath ten talents , is an emblem. It tacitly 
intimates, — 1st That the Saints, who diligently use the grace of 
God, are worthy of greater grace ; and that as to the grace which 

the unworthy and the slothful possess, it is not seldom, even in 

VOL. 11L 1

this life, transferred from them to the former. Thus it is said in 
Apoc. iii. ii, “Hold fast that thou hast, that no man take thy 
crown.” ad. That the Saints in Heaven will rejoice, both on 
account of their own talents, as well as those of the reprobate. 
3d. Because God, in Heaven, will bestow all gifts, all endowments 
and graces, even those which the reprobate have possessed in this 
world, upon the Blessed. For Beatitude is a state which is perfect 
by reason of the aggregation of all good, as Boetius says. Under- 
stand that these gifts are here spoken of, not as to their number, 
but as to their kind. 

Ver. 29. For unto every one that hath , &c. The Arab, is, Unto 
him that hath shall be given , and shall be added ; and from him 
that hath not shall be taken away that which is with him . 

To every one that hath S. Chrysostom and S. Augustine explain 
this to mean, all who rightly use their talents. For he, in truth, 
possesses a talent who rightly uses it For the idle person, who 
does not make use of it, does not appear really to have it 

But he who hath not, that is to say, the gain of the talents and 
the grace acquired by him ; or, he who has not, in the sense that 
he does not use his talent, as I have said, even that which he 
seemeth to have , that is, the talent which he has suffered to lie idle, 
so that he has not so much had it, as seemed to have it, shall 
be taken away from him. After a like fashion saith the comic 
poet, “The covetous man lacks that which he hath as much as 
if he had it not” He hides it in his chest, so that it is the 
chest which hath it, not himself. The covetous man does not 
so much possess his gold, as he is possessed and owned by his 
gold. He is its slave. 

From this passage Theologians derive the maxim, that “God is 
never wanting to him who does his best” Nor does He refuse 
to add even more and more grace to him who heartily co-operates 
with it, even to the final gift of perseverance and glory. How 
this is to be understood, see Suarez, Vasquez, Bellarmine, and 
others in their works on Grace.

MAJESTY OF CHRIST. 


131 

Hts majesty , as Judge of all, sitting upon a glorious cloud Here 
Christ graphically sets forth the manner and idea of the Last 
Judgment, that all may imprint it on their minds, and so by the 
constant remembrance of it, stir themselves up to purity of life 
and zeal for good works. 

The majesty of Christ will appear. 1st By the previous sound- 
ing of the awful trumpet of the Archangel, which will be heard 
throughout all the world ad By the previous lightnings and 
thunderings, tempest and hail, according to the words in Ps. 
xcvii. 3. 3d Because Christ shall appear in His glorious body, 
brighter than the sun, as it is said in Isaiah, “Then shall the 
moon be ashamed and the sun be confounded, when the Lord 
of Hosts shall reign,” taken in the mystical sense. For there 

is another and literal interpretation of these words, as I have 
shown in commenting upon the passage. 4th. Because He shall 
descend from Heaven accompanied by innumerable legions of 
angels. 5th. Because there shall stand before Him in judgment 
all emperors, pontiffs, kings, prelates, princes, philosophers, orators, 
and all men and nations whatsoever. 6th. Because He shall 
judge them not as belonging to others, but as His own Servants. 
For all men and angels are the Servants of Christ not only as 
He is God, by the right of creation, but also as He is man, by 
virtue of the Hypostatic Union with the Word, and by right 
of merit For Christ merited this by His lowly obedience even 
to the death of the Cross, according to what the Apostle says 
(Phil, ii 7, 8), “ He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto 
death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath 
highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every 
name ; that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of 
things in Heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth ; 
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, 
to the glory of God the Father.” Though men, indeed, are the 
servants of Christ by the peculiar right of redemption. For 
Christ hath redeemed them from death and hell, and bought 
them with the costly price of His own Blood

And all the angels with Him. Therefore m the Day of 
Judgment not one angel shall remain in Heaven, but all shall 
descend at the same time with Christ They shall accompany 
Him to do Him honour, as God, and Lord, and Saviour, that 
they may surround and minister to Him as He is Man. More- 
over, it is probable that the angels shall then assume bodies of 
condensed air, and in them shall appear in glory. For otherwise 
this glory and power of Christ, as encompassed by the angels, 
would not be beheld by the wicked, on whose account chiefly 
it will then be manifested. Nor would that army of angels 
increase His outward majesty, which is what Christ is here 
describing. When, therefore, there shall be that innumerable 
multitude of angels, their many thousands of thousands will fill 
the higher regions of the air, far and wide, in every direction, 
yea, the very sky itself, affording the appearance of an infinite 
army. 

It is also exceedingly probable that the devils also will assume 
bodies, and appear in them, but bodies that are foul, dreadful, 
and horrible. 

And there shall be gathered together before Him all nations, Le., 
all men sprung from Adam, from the first even unto the last, 
of every family and nation, however fierce and barbarous. Also 
little ones “and infants, although the case and judgment of infants 
is not here properly treated of, but only that of adults, who by 
their good or bad works have deserved Heaven or hell Where- 
fore there will be there very many millions of men, so that the 
valley of Josaphat could not contain them all Wherefore God 
shall at that time turn the Mount of Olives and the other 
mountains into a plain, that there may be space to hold so- many 
myriads of men. For all the reprobate shall stand upon the 
earth. But the Saints, especially the more eminent ones, such 
as the Apostles, shall be raised up into the air, where they shall 
sit as assessors with Christ 

That little children will appear in the Day of Judgment is 
exceedingly probable, though Durandus denies this (a, disp. 33,

quast 3). The reasons that make it probable are: — 1st Because 
Christ is the Judge of all men whatsoever, therefore also of 
infants. 2d. Because infants shall rise again as well as adults* 
and that “in a perfect man/’ as the Apostle says (Eph iv. 13), 
that is, adult age and stature. They will see therefore and 
know that all men are rising with them, to stand and be judged 
at the tribunal of Christ 3d. Because many infants have been 
made Saints and Martyrs by Baptism or martyrdom. Such were 
the infants who were slain by Herod. These therefore, as well as 
adults, shall hear from Christ the words, Come, ye blessed of My 
Father. 4th. Because the infants who have died in original sin 
among all nations, for so many thousands of years, will be very 
many. Lessius thinks that their number will be a thousand 
millions (de Perfect . Divin. cap . 22, num. 143). And these cannot 
be hid; but rising again, they will appear upon earth. And 
these too, being separated one from another, shall receive their 
sentences from Christ. They shall neither be condemned, like 
the adult reprobate, to the fire of hell ; neither shall they be 
adjudged to He&ven to see God, as the adult elect. 

And He shall separate them . He compares the elect to sheep , 
because of their innocence, modesty, humility, obedience, and 
patience; the reprobate to goats, because this creature has a 
fetid smelL It is fierce, immodest, lascivious. It walks in pre- 
cipitous places. And it is quarrelsome. Such are the wicked. 
Wherefore under the Old Law goats were wont to be offered as 
sin-offerings. 

There was a type of their separation in the case of those who 
blessed on Mount Gerizim, and those who cursed on Mount Ebal 
(Deut. xxvil). 

And He shall set the sheep , &c. For the right hand is the 
symbol of felicity, glory, and victory. The left, of unhappiness 
and disgrace. 

Then shall the King say to those on the right hand, &c. “Come 
from darkness to light, from slavery to the liberty of the children 
of God, from labour to perpetual rest, from death unto life, from

the society of wicked men to the company of angels, from contest 
to triumph, from the billows of temptation to the light of glory, 
and the Heaven of eternal happiness.” 

In a moving manner does S. Hippolytus, the Martyr, enlarge 
upon these words (Tract, de Consummat. Sceculi), speaking of the 
different Orders of the Saints. “Come, ye Prophets, who were 
banished for My Name's sake. Come, ye Patriarchs, who were 
obedient unto Me before I came into the world, and who deserved 
My Kingdom. Come, ye Apostles, partakers of My sufferings, 
for the sake of the Gospel, when I lived amongst men. Come, 
ye Martyrs, who confessed Me before tyrants, and endured great 
torments and sufferings. Come, ye Priests, who offered pure 
sacrifices unto Me day and night, and immolated day by day 
My precious Body and Blood. Come, ye Saints, who practised 
self-denial in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth, who 
by continence and prayers did service to My Name. Come, ye 
Virgins, who chose Me for your Bridegroom, and loved not another 
besides Me, who by martyrdom, and the diligent practice of 
religion, were united to Me, your immortal and incorruptible 
Spouse. Come, ye who love the poor and strangers. Come, ye 
who kept My love, who am Love. Come, ye friends of peace, for 
I am peace.” 

Christ judges and rewards the elect before He punishes the 
reprobate; for it is natural to Christ to reward; it is His strange 
work to punish. 

Ihe King. Christ the Judge has on His thigh a name written, 
“ King of kings and Lord of lords” ( Apoc . xix. 16).

attributes are omnipotence, empire, and predestination, “hath

justified in time, and now will glorify : to whom He gave grace 
and perseverance in good works until the end of their lives, 
and therefore He has now, through Me, given them for their 
merits the reward of celestial glory.” Come therefore, ye

Blessed, thrice and again Blessed, whom God loved and predes- 
tinated before the world, cleansed and sanctified in the world, 
and now will magnify after the world, as S. Augustine says in his 
Soliloquy . 

Observe : the judgment of Christ will not be performed in a 
moment of time, as will be the case with the general Resurrec- 
tion (1 Cor . xv. 52), but will occupy some considerable period. 
For there will be an examination and opening of the conscience 
of each person, in which Christ will lay open to every man his 
own and others’ deeds by an inward illumination, and will pro- 
nounce His own sentence upon each, according to his deserts. 
And He will cause all to see that this sentence is just and right ; 
and He will’ not give any opportunity for taking exception or 
for prevarication. “It will be," says S. Augustine (do Civil. 
xx. 14), “an effect of the Divine power, that every one will 
have recalled to their memory their deeds, both good and bad. 
And by a glance of the mind they will be perceived with a 
marvellous swiftness, so that this knowledge will either accuse or 
excuse their consciousness." All this will occupy time, though 
but a very short time. After this will Christ pronounce, as it 
seems, the general award of eternal felicity, with an audible voice, 
to all the Saints, when He says, “ Como, ye blessed of My Father 
&c. ; and then will pass sentence upon the reprobate, saying, 
“ Depart , ye cursed \ n 

Possess ye (Vulg.) ; Gr. xXvwouriectn, inherit (Eng. vers.). “ For 
if ye are sons, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with 
Christ” (Rom. viii.). “O of what great glory, of what great 
blessedness, are those words ! He does not say, Receive ye ; 
but, Inherit ye, as though it were your own, your Father’s; 
as though it were your very own, belonging to you from the 
beginning.” 

The Kingdom: the highest Heaven, with all its goods, such 
as the vision and fruition of God, the society of Saints and 
Angels.

the world* That is to say, from eternity. It means that the whole 
universe was created by God for the sake of the Blessed, that they 
may be eternally blessed in Him. Moreover, this glory of the 
Saints had been prepared and predestinated — x. From eternity . 
For God from eternity determined to create the Saints and the 
world, that He might bless them in it, and cause them to share in 
all His goods, a. From the creation of the world. For God created 
the empyrean and the world for this end, that it might be the seat 
and kingdom of the Blessed. As S. Chrysostom says (Horn, i, in 
Epist. ad Titum ), “ Herein is manifested our dignity, that not just 
now merely, but from of old, from the very beginning, have we been 
loved.” And {Horn. 34, in Gen.), M Behold the excellence of the 
goodness of God ; how great is the mercy which He hath extended 
to our race, that before the foundations of the world were laid, He 
deigned to prepare for us the fruition of the Kingdom of Heaven.” 

O how sweetly will this voice of Christ fall upon the ears of the 
elect ! What thanks will they render Him ! How will they exult I 
We cannot doubt but that with the utmost reverence they will pros- 
trate themselves before Him, and gladly confess that it is by His 
Blood and merits they have been brought to such great felicity. 
This is plain from the Apocalypse {chaps, v. and vii.), where we 
may hear their doxologies and songs of victory, which in full chorus 
they sing to God and Christ 

Ver. 35. For I was an hungered, &c. ... a stranger, and ye collected 
Me (Vulg.), i.e., into your houses or other hospices. Observe here 
that Christ puts one sort of good works, by which the Saints will 
merit the eternal glory decreed to them by Christ in the judgment, 
instead of every kind of good works. He only speaks of works of 
mercy, both because they are, as it were, natural and everywhere 
at hand, and have to do with every one. For there are very many 
everywhere who are wretched. As also because the common people 
make most account of these works, since they themselves are less 
capable of giving themselves to fasting, prayers, and other lofty 
things. Further, no one can excuse himself from the performance 
of them; and, as S. Augustine says, they are most profitable for

DUTY TO THE NEEDY.

obtaining the grace of God. Hear S. Basil (Cone, 4, de Eleemosyn .), 
M That bread, which thou holdest back, belongs to the hungry ; the 
naked claims that garment which thou art keeping in thy chest 
That shoe which is mouldering away at home is his who is shoeless. 
Thus thou art wronging jist as many as thou dost not help with 
thy goods whilst thou mayest.” “ Blessed,” says David, “is the 
man that is merciful and lendeth; he guideth his words with 
discretion ” (Ps. cxii. 5) ; or, as S. Chrysostom reads, “ he renders 
his accounts.” As much as to say, “ He will render a most excellent 
account of his life; he will plead successfully his cause before 
the Supreme Judge.” “And indeed,” says the same S. Chrysos- 
tom, “ it must needs be that the soul which is rich in mercy can 
never be overwhelmed with heavy troubles of the mind.” And 
again, “ Uselessly will sins accuse him whom the poor man excuses. 
And he cannot be excused whom the poor man’s hunger accuses. 
He will witness a terrible day who shall enter into the Judgment 
without the intercession of the poor. He who lends to a poor man 
makes the Judge Himself his debtor” (S, Peter Chrysolog. Serm, 40). 

Moreover, we cannot doubt that many will be saved or con- 
demned because of other virtues and sins of greater importance. 
For there are numbers who can scarcely practise works of mercy, 
as paupers, children, Religious, who do and practise greater things, 
as chastity, obedience, evangelical poverty, contemplation, conver- 
sion of others, on account of which they shall obtain greater rewards 
from Christ, according to His words, “Blessed are the poor in 
spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven,” &c. 

Wherefore it does not appear that Christ will pronounce these 
words with an audible voice, as He will the sentence itself of salva- 
tion or condemnation ; but He will reveal them to the heart of each 
by a sort of spiritual instinct From this it is plain that the elect 
are chosen, and have Heaven awarded to them because of their good 
works. Therefore good works deserve Heaven and heavenly glory. 
Therefore this glory is given by Christ to the Saints for an inherit- 
ance, as it were, as unto sons, and at the same time as a reward, 
as to those who merit it and are worthy of it. For God does

not give the Kingdom to sons whether they be worthy or unworthy, 
as is often the case among mem 

There are six principal corporal works of mercy which Christ 
here speaks of, viz., to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, 
to take in strangers, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick, to com- 
fort and redeem captives, to which may be added a seventh, to 
bury the dead, which is commanded in Tobit There are as many 
spiritual works of mercy, which Christ here would have us under- 
stand under the corporal works. They are as much superior to 
the corporal works as the soul is superior to the body. They are — 
to correct sinners, to teach the ignorant, to give good advice to the 
perplexed, to pray to God for the salvation of our neighbours, to 
comfort the sorrowful, to bear injuries patiently, and to forgive 
injuries. Concerning these, see Peter Canisius in Opere Catechistico. 

Naked \ &c. This is what Christ said (ix. 13), “I will have mercy 
and not sacrifice.” For mercy is a covering, and, as it were, 
redeems the faults and miseries of the merciful Hear S. Augus- 
tine (Serm. 33, de Divers.), “It is written, as water extinguishes 
fire, so doth alms extinguish sin. Surely to those whom He is 
about to crown will He attribute alms alone ; as though He said, 
‘ It were difficult that, if I should examine and weigh you, and most 
carefully scrutinise your deeds, I should not find something to con- 
demn you ; but go ye into My Kingdom, for I was hungry, and ye 
fed Me. Ye go into My Kingdom, not because ye have not sinned, 
but because ye have redeemed your sins by alms.'” 

Vers. 37-39. Then shall the righteous say , expressing their wonder 
at Christ's liberality towards them, not so much with their lips as in 
their hearts. When saw we. By this word when is expressed at 
once the profound humility and the exultation of the Saints in that 
they hear their few and poor works made so much of by Christ, as 
that He should count them as done to Himself, because they were 
done to the poor for love of Christ 

And the King shall answer , &c. . . . one of the least of these. The 
word these strictly denotes the Apostles, and Religious and Apostolic 
men similar to them, who shall sit as assessors with Christ as Judge.

In this world they were accounted the least and most abject And 
to themselves in their humility they seemed to be the very least of 
alL Inasmuch as they voluntarily embraced poverty of spirit, they 
gave themselves up altogether to the cross of Christ and to the 
preaching of the faith. But in the second place, all poor Christians 
who, having been bom again in baptism, have been by grace made 
children of God, and therefore brethren of Christ, are denoted by 
the word these , . Observe that infidels and the reprobate, though 
they may have been once brothers of Christ, are not here counted 
worthy of the name. Still He does not forbid giving them alms. 
Well says S. Cyprian in his Treatise on Almsgivings “What more 
could Christ declare unto us? How could He do more to provoke 
to works of justice and mercy, than by pronouncing that whatever 
is done to the poor and needy is done to Himself ? That he who 
is not moved by the consideration of his brother in the Church may 
be moved at least by considering Christ And that he who does 
not think of his fellow-servant in labour and need, may at least think 
of his Master, who stands in the place of him whom he despises.” 

This was the reason why S. Louis, king of France, was accustomed 
to distribute food with his own hands to two hundred poor persons 
on all vigils and festivals, and to wash their feet on Saturdays. He 
also daily entertained at his own table three poor old men, and 
afterwards ate what they left. When some persons objected that 
this was derogatory to the majesty of a king, he made answer, “ I 
revere Christ in the poor, Christ who said, * What ye do unto the 
least of Mine, ye do unto Me.*” And he was wont to add, “The 
poor prepare Heaven for themselves by patience, but the rich by 
alms and reverence, whereby they love and venerate the poor as 
the members of Christ.” O wise and holy king ! Would that 
kings and princes would follow in his steps ! 

From these words of Christ S. Francis was wont to encourage his 
Friars freely to solicit alms. He himself was wont to beg upon the 
great Festivals. He said that the words of the Psalmist, “ Man did 
eat angels* food,” were fulfilled in holy paupers. For that, he said, 
was angelic food which was asked for the love of God, which, at

the suggestion of the angels, was bestowed for the love of God, and 
which holy poverty collected from door to door. 

Ver. 41. Then shall He say to those on the left , &c. Note the anti- 
thesis : Christ says to the elect, “ Come to Me and to My glory.” 
But to the reprobate, u Depart from Me, to the devil and hell, 
because in life ye clave to the devil, and not to Me.” The word 
depart denotes the pain of loss (poena damnt ), which is the depriva- 
tion of the glory of Heaven for ever. But the word fire denotes the 
pain of sense; for the fire of hell bums continually, not only the 
bodies, but the souls of the wicked, and yet does not consume them. 
This punishment is very dreadful For to be banished from God, 
from Christ, from Heaven, from the Saints, from everything that is 
good, is horrible torment. Wherefore S. Chrysostom (Parcen. i, 
ad Theodor . lapsum) thinks that the deprivation of the vision of 
God is a greater torment to the damned than the fire of hell 
Others entertain the opposite opinion. Isaiah says, “The wicked 
shall not behold the glory of the Lord” (xxvi. io). Cursed , those 
whom God will curse as His enemies. Into the fire , therefore 
there is real fire in hell, and that far fiercer and of a different 
nature and quality from earthly fire. This is the teaching of S. 
Ambrose (in cap . 14, £ Luc.), S. Jerome (in Isa. chaps. Ixv., lxvl), 
Damascene (lib. 4, cap. ult.). 

Moreover, this fire is fed by sulphur, which also God will preserve 
for ever, that it may continually bum the wicked. This is the fire 
with which Moses threatened the Jews in Deut xxxii. 22, “A fire 
is kindled in My fury, and it shall burn unto the lowest helL” 
Hear what S. Chrysostom says, “ They shall be thrust into the river 
and the sea of fire, a sea which can never be crossed, in which the 
waves of fire rise mountains high. Fire, I say, but not earthly fire, 
but far more terrible than any here, whose flames fill the great 
abyss, so that on every hand the fire seems ready to overwhelm, 
like some immense wild beast If we cannot describe in language 
the most bitter torments of that fire and those flames, what shall we 
say of them? especially when we consider that a man placed for 
one moment in earthly fire would die; but there they are burnt

and suffer, and never will that which is burnt be consumed ” (Horn. 
44 in loci). 

Everlasting . Origen, therefore, is in error in thinking that the 
pains of hell shall cease, and that the wicked shall be delivered 
out of them on the completion of the Platonic year, that is, after 
several thousands of years. For the eternity of punishment in 
hell is here expressed. So Bede, Theophylact, and others passim. 
This will be the awful punishment, which will drive the damned 
to despair, fury, madness, to blaspheming God, their parents, 
comrades, and all creatures, because so long as Heaven shall 
last, so long will there be a hell. It shall last as long as God 

Himself and the universe shall endure. So long shall the repro- 

bate endure, “ and shall be tormented day and night for ages 
of ages” (Apoc. xx. 10). Think of this fire when lust, or ambi- 
tiofi, or any other temptation entice thee, and say to thyself 

“I will not purchase everlasting fire at the price of a little 

pleasure.” 

S. Hippolytus the Martyr enlarges upon these words of Christ 
in a very moving manner in his Treatise on the End of the World. 
He introduces Christ as reproaching the wicked for their abuse 
of His benefits, “It was I who formed you, and ye dave to 
another. I created the earth, the sea, and all things for your 
sakes, and you misused them to My dishonour. Depart from Me, 
ye workers of iniquity, I know you not. Ye have become the 
workmen of another master, even the devil. With him possess 
darkness, and the fire which shall not be quenched, and the worm 
which sleepeth not, and the gnashing of teeth.” After an interval 
he adds, “ I formed your ears that you should hear the Scriptures, 
and you applied them to songs of devils, to harps, and jokes. 
I created your eyes that ye might behold the light of My com- 
mandments, and follow them; but ye opened them for adultery, 
and immodesty, and all uncleanness. I ordained your mouth for 
the praise and glory of God, and to sing psalms and spiritual songs ; 
but ye applied it for the utterance of revilings, perjuries, and blas- 
phemies. I made your hands, that you should lift them up in

S. MATTHEW, C. XXV. 


prayers and supplications; ye have stretched them out in thefts 
and murders.” And thus he proceeds. 

After He has pronounced this sentence, Christ will drive them 
from Him by means of the demons into helL Yea, all the elements, 
together with the heavens, shall rise against them. For, as it is 
said in Wisdom (vi. 18), “He shall arm the creatures to take 
vengeance upon His enemies, and the whole world shall fight for 
Him against the foolish ones. The right aiming thunderbolts shall 
go forth. The water of the sea shall rage against them, and the 
rivers shall flow together upon them. A spirit of strength shall 
stand against them, and like a whirlwind shall divide them.” 

Prepared for the devil and his angels , that is, for their chief prince 
and his armies , Arab. From hence it is plain that the fire of hell 
was primarily, and per se 9 prepared by God for the demons, but 
as a consequence was prepared for men who imitate the disobed- 
ience of the devils. Moreover, this fire was prepared by God 
from everlasting, after the foreseen sin of Lucifer and the demons. 
For their God decreed to form it for their punishment But it 
was actually made, in time, by God at the commencement of the 
universe, before the creation of man. 

The Syr. instead of devil has accuser , which is the meaning of 
the Gr. diajSoXot, for such is Lucifer, who accuses holy men, and 
even their just works, before God. Hence in the Acts of S. Mon- 
tanus and his companions, martyrs, the accuser and criminator of 
the martyrs is called diabolus , because he acted his part before the 
tribunal of the heathen judges. 

Vers. 42, 43. For I was an hungered , &c. The word “for* 
gives the reason why they are condemned to the fire prepared 
for the devil, because, that is, they imitated his mercilessness. 
“For,” as Theophylact says, “they who are without compassion 
are devils.” These men are condemned for the omission of the 
works of mercy, both because every one is bound to the per- 
formance of these works when he sees his neighbour in need, 
as well as because they neglected to expiate their other sins 
by almsdeeds, according to the saying of Daniel to Nebuchad*

THE INGRATITUDE OF THE WICKED. 1 43 

nezzar, “Redeem thy sins by almsgiving, and thy iniquities by 
mercy to the poor* (Dan. iv. 24, Vulg.). Whence S. Augustine 
asserts that some men cannot be saved without almsgiving. Now, 
if he who is convicted of not having given alms shall suffer so 
great a punishment, says S. Gregory, what shall be the penalty 
of him who has committed murder or adultery, or who has 
blasphemed God and His saints ? 

Every word is emphatic, and reproaches the reprobate with 
peculiar ingratitude. 1 was an hungered , I, who am your God, 
your Lord, and your Redeemer, and ye gave not unto Me , that 
which I had given you, to eat \ not partridges and capons, which 
ye ate yourselves, but simply bread. “Each circumstance,” says 
S. Chrysostom, “ suffices for their condemnation ; as the simple 
nature of the request and the power to grant it: for bread is 
asked ; then there is the misery of the petitioner, poor and a beggar .* 
the greatness of the reward to be obtained, for a kingdom is 
promised: the dread of the punishment, for hell is threatened: 
the dignity of the receiver, for God receives, through the hands of 
the poor : the right which there is to bestow, for it is the highest 
form of justice to render unto God His own. Yet from all these 
things they were held back by covetousness.” 

Ver. 45. Then He shall answer them , sayings &c. Learn from 
hence how greatly to be esteemed are the mean and poor, 
especially Saints and Religious, whom Christ here calls His own 
property, as it were. Wherefore S. Francis sharply rebuked one 
of his Friars for finding fault with a certain beggar, and saying 
that, perchance, he was proud in his mind, and ordered him to 
ask his pardon on his knees. And he gave his reason. “My 
son,” he said, “ thou hast not sinned against the beggar so much 
as against Christ. Forasmuch as Christ is offered to us in the 
person of the poor, as it were in a glass. As often therefore 
as the poor and infirm meet thee, think of and humbly vene- 
rate the poverty and infirmities which Christ deigned to endure 
for us.” 

Ver. 46. And these shall go; Gr. shall go away , &c. . . . punish

tnent, that is, of fire and burning. Whence S. Augustine reads 
(Tract. 21, in Joan.), into burning. It means, they shall be burnt 
in hell, but not burnt up, nor consumed, so as to be annihilated, 
which the lost will desire. 

Everlasting, because they have most grievously offended the 
Eternal God. For mortal sin, because it is an injury against the 
Infinite God, has in it an infinite wickedness, therefore it deserves 
an infinite punishment But, forasmuch as punishment infinite in 
intensity can neither be given nor yet endured by man, there shall 
be given to the reprobate a punishment of infinite duration which 
shall last for ever and ever. 

The author of the book on the Spirit and the Soul \ in the works 
of S. Augustine, forcibly depicts the dreadfulness of this punish- 
ment He says, there is to these miserable beings death without 
death, end without end, consumption without being consumed. 
For death also shall always live, and the end shall always be 
beginning. Death shall destroy, and not annihilate. Pain shall 
torment, and not put fear to flight The flame shall bum, but 
shall not disperse the darkness. For there shall be darkness in 
the fire, fear in the darkness, and pain in the burning. Thus 
shall the reprobate be tormented without hope of pardon or 
mercy, which is the misery of miseries. For if, after as many 
thousands of years as they had hairs upon their heads, they 
might hope for an end of their punishment, they would sustain 
it with fax greater ease; but because they neither have nor will 
have any hope, they will fall into despair, and will have no 
strength to support their torments. 

Hence S. Cyprian (Lib. de Laud. Martyr . cap. 5), " Paradise 
flourishes by the witness of God; hell embraces, the eternal fire 
consumes those who deny it It is a dreadful place whose name 
is hell, with a great murmuring and groaning of those that wail, 
and with flames bursting out through the horrible night of thick 
darkness.” 

From what has been said, we may consider and imagine how 
bitter and how sad must be the future everlasting separation

between the lost and the saved, — when the one shall ascend up 
into Heaven to everlasting happiness, and the others shall go 
down into hell to everlasting fire. Never again, to all eternity, 
shall they behold the Saints — not even their friends, their brothers, 
or their parents. For there is a great gulf fixed between the two, 
as Abraham said to the rich glutton. Thou, therefore, who art 
wise, ascend daily into Heaven, and descend into hell, that from 
thence thou mayest gain incentives to flee from vice and pursue 
virtue. Truly does S. Chrysostom say (Horn. 2 in Epist. 2 ad 
Thessaly “ No one who has hell before his eyes will ever fall into 
helL No one who despises hell will escape it” We may say with 
S. Diethelmus, in Ven. Bede's History of the English , “ I have 
seen worse and more dreadful things in helL” By this means we 
shall bravely sustain and overcome all temptations, persecutions, 
infirmities, and tribulations through fear of the judgment and of 
hell. 

Life eternal. By these words is meant the receiving of all health, 
all strength, all honour, all glory, all pleasure, all joy, and every- 
thing that is good. For these are the things which those enjoy 
who truly live ; for to live in hunger, thirst, disease, ignominy, pain, 
is not so much to live as to die continually.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

3 The rulers conspire against Christ. 14 Judas selleth him. 17 Christ eateth the 
passover. 47 He is betrayed by Judas. 

A ND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto 
his disciples, 

2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man 
is betrayed to be crucified. 

3 H Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders 
of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 

4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 

5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the 
people. 

6 IT Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 

7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious 
ointment, and poured it on his head as he sat of meat. 

8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what pur- 
pose is this waste ? 

9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 

10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? 
for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 

1 1 For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always. 

12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my 
buriaL 

13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the 
whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a 
memorial of her. 

14 H Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief 
priests, 

15 And said unto them. What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto 
you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 

16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 

17 IT Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came 
to Jesus, saying unto him. Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the 
passover?

18 And he said. Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The 
Master saith, My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my 
disciples. 

19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made read 
the passover. 

20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 

21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall 
betray me. 

22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say 
unto him, Lord, is it I ? 

23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish 
the same shall betray me. 

24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by 
whom the Son of man is betrayed I it had been good for that man if he had not 
been born. 

25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He 
said unto him, Thou hast said. 

26 And, as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and break it, 
and gave it to the disciples, and said. Take, eat : this is my body. 

27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink 
ye all of it : 

28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the 
remission of sins. 

29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, 
until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom. 

30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives. 

31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this 
night ; for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock 
shall be scattered abroad. 

32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 

33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended 
because of thee, yet will I never be offended. 

34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee. That this night, before the 
cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 

35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny 
thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 

36 IT Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith 
unto the disciples. Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 

37 And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to 
be sorrowful and very heavy. 

38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death : 
tarry ye here, and watch with me. 

39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O 
my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me : nevertheless, not as I 
will, but as thou wilt, 

40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto 
Peter, What I could ye not watch with me one hour ? 

41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed U 
willing, but the flesh is weak.

42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if 
this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 

43 And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy ; 

44 And he left them and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying 
the same words. 

45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and 
take your rest : behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed 
into the hands of sinners. 

46 Rise, let us be going : behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 

47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him 
a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the 
people. 

48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall 
kiss, that same is he ; hold him fast. 

49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said. Hail, Master ; and kissed him. 

50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come ? Then came 
they and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 

51 And behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, 
and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and smote off 
his ear. 

52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place : for all 
they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 

53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently 
give me more than twelve legions of angels ? 

54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 

55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out, as against 
a thief, with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in 
the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 

56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. 
Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. 

57 And they that laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, 
where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 

58 But Peter followed him afar 0$ unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, 
and sat with the servants to see the end. 

59 Now the chief priests and elders, and all the council, sought false witness 
against Jesus, to put him to death ; 

60 But found none : yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they 
none. At the last came two false witnesses, 

61 And said. This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to 
build it in three days. 

. 62 And the high priest arose and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? 
what is it which these witness against thee ? 

63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, 
I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, 
the Son of God. 

64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you, 
Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand Of power, and 
soming in the clouds of heaven. 

65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying. He hath spoken blasphemy }

what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his 
blasphemy. 

66 What think ye ? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 

67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him ; and others smote him 
with the palms of their hands, 

68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee ? 

69 H Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him, 
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 

70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 

71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and 
said onto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 

72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 

73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, 
Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 

74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And 
immediately the cock crew. 

75 And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, which said unto him. Before 
the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 

And it came to pass, when He had finished, or completed, all that 
He had spoken in the last chapter concerning the destruction of 
Jerusalem and the end of the world, then He girded Himself to 
meet His Passion, which was nigh at hand, and foretold it He 
would not seem to be ignorant of the things which were shortly 
to come to pass, whilst He prophesied of those in the far distant 
future. He would not have His disciples suppose that Christ 
was ignorant of the things which were to befall Him, or that they 
happened to Him against His will; but that they might know 
that all was foreseen by Him. The meaning is, as S. Thomas 
expresses it, “When Christ had fulfilled His offiice as a Teacher, 
He began to prepare Himself for the office of a Redeemer and 
a Saviour/ 

Ye know, &c., after two days . He said, therefore, these things 

on the Tuesday evening, when, after the Hebrew custom, the 
fourth day of the week, or Wednesday, was about to begin. This 
was the reckoning employed with respect to festivals. For, as 
Pererius says (on Gen. L 5, on the words, “The evening and the 
morning were one day”), “It is certain that the ancient Jews 
reckoned their days by a threefold method.” First, the legal day 
from evening to evening. Secondly, the natural day from sunrise

ISO 

to sunrise. Thirdly, the common day from midnight to midnight 
Wherefore Christ saith truly, After two days shall be the feast of the 
Passover , because after two days, that is to say, Wednesday and 
Thursday, on the evening of Thursday, when Friday is about to 
begin, is the Passover. 

The Passover . This means in Hebrew, passing over, because the 
angel passed over the houses of the Hebrews. For pasach means 
to pass over . But the Syrians write pascha not with samech, as the 
Hebrews, but with tsadc, and then pascha signifies joy and glad- 
ness, for the feast of the Passover was a time of utmost joyfulness. 

Then were gathered together , &c Then means on the morning 
of the fourth day of the week, or Wednesday. It was on the 
morning of this day that Judas came to them, and sold Christ to 
them for the stipulated price of thirty denarii, according to the 
general opinion of the Church, and as the same may be gathered 
from S. Matthew’s narrative. Wherefore from this council of the 
Jews, and selling of Jesus, the ancient Christians were accustomed 
to fast on Wednesday, as S. Augustine testifies (Epist. 86). More- 
over, the Greeks, and many inhabitants of Poland and Holland, 
still abstain from eating flesh on Wednesday, because on that day 
the flesh of Christ was sold. 

Observe, we gather from S. Matthew’s narrative that on these 
two days — Wednesday and Thursday — Christ did not come into 
Jerusalem, as He had done on the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, 
but remained at Bethany, and only returned to Jerusalem towards 
the evening of Thursday, that He might celebrate the Passover. 

Take Jesus by subtilty — by subtilty, because they were afraid lest 
Christ should take Himself out of their hands, as He had done 
before. Again, they seek a stratagem, that they might seize Him 
without a tumult of the people. For they were afraid lest the 
people, hanging upon the words of Christ, as a very great prophet, 
might fight for Him, and not suffer Him to be taken. Wherefore 
it follows, 

For they said, &c. It was not, therefore, out of regard for the 
festival, but from fear of the people, that they were unwilling to

take Jesus on the feast of the Passover. For at this feast a count- 
less multitude of Jews flocked together to Jerusalem, among whom 
were many who had received salvation both of body and soul from 
Jesus, who, they feared, would defend Him. Wherefore, “They 
had no zeal for devotion, but for wickedness,” says S. Jerome. In 
like manner, Herod Agrippa did not wish to put Peter to death 
until after the Passover (Acts xii.). For the Passover was to the 
Jews a festival of liberty and joy, because in it they celebrated 
their deliverance from the slavery of Egypt Whence they were 
accustomed to release condemned persons at that time, as they 
released Barabbas. The rulers, therefore, had decreed to take 
Christ and put Him to death after the Passover ; but in consequence 
of the treachery of Judas, they changed their purpose. For the 
counsel and purpose of God was, that Christ should die at the 
Passover, in order that He might show that the antitype answered 
to its type. For the sacrifice of a lamb, which took place at the 
Passover, was a type that Christ would be sacrificed at that feast 
By this circumstance God signified that Christ was the very Paschal 
Lamb, who suffered upon the cross for the redemption of the world. 

In the house of Simon the leper. Matthew repeats more cir- 
cumstantially things which had already happened, in order to 
relate the manner in which Christ was taken. For Judas was 
moved to betray Christ to the Jews by the occasion of this 
ointment, that he might by his treachery recover the price of 
the ointment, and, like a thief, as he was, hide it in his coffers. 
This feast, when Christ was in the house of Simon, took place 
on the day before Palm Sunday, as is plain from S. John xii. i, 
where it is said, six days before the Passover , which was Friday, 
He came to Bethany. And it is added, they made Him a feasts 
that is, Simon and his friends. This was on the Saturday, or the 
Sabbath ; and the next day was Palm Sunday. 

Simon the leper. Some of the Fathers are of opinion that 
Simon had really been a leper, and had been healed by Christ. 
Others think that Leper was a patronymic of the family of Simon, 
either because he was descended from a leper, or because of

some connection with lepers. Thus there were at Rome the 
families of the Claudii ( the Lame\ and the Balbi ( the Stutterers ), 
although there were many members of those families who were 
neither lame nor stutterers. 

There came to Him a woman , &c. This was the same feast 
as that which S. John gives an account of (xii. i), as will be seen 
by comparing these two Evangelists. S. Matthew relates it in 
order to explain the occasion of Judas’ being moved to betray 
Christ, as I have said 

You may object that John says, They made Him a feasts and 
Martha served, \ which might seem to intimate that the feast was 
in Martha’s house, not in Simon’s. I reply by denying the 
inference. John does not say that Martha and Mary made Him 
a feast, but simply, they, that is, some persons, made one . The 
persons meant were the inhabitants of Bethany, friends of Jesus, 
prominent among whom was this Simon the leper. But Martha 
ministered at this supper, either because she was a neighbour, or 
because she was a friend and relative of Simon. 

A woman . Mary Magdalene, as S. John says expressly (xii. 3), 
who, as she had two years before this repented, and washed the 
feet of Jesus with her tears, and anointed them with ointment, 
so upon this occasion likewise, six days before His death, she 
did the same thing, partly from devotion, and partly by an 
inspiration from God, as a kind of prophecy of Christ’s rapidly 
approaching death and burial 

Alabaster. Vessels made of alabaster, or onyx stone, which 
Pliny says was an excellent material for preserving ointment 
incorrupt (lib. 36, cap. 8), were made use of for this purpose. 
Wherefore it is not surprising that this hollow vessel, which was 
as thin and brittle as glass, might easily be broken by Mary 
Magdalene, by striking it with a small hammer, so that she might 
pour the whole of the ointment upon the head of Christ. Unless 
you prefer to think, with Suidas, that this so-called alabaster box 
was a clear vessel without a handle, such as chemists have in 
their. $h ops to keep unguents and drugs in.

MARY’S OINTMENT. 


*53 


S. Epiphanius (lib. de Afensuris) says, “This box was a small 
glass vessel of ointment, containing a pound of oil It was called 
alabaster because of its brittleness.” 

Ointment . I have shown on Eccles. ix. 8 that the Jews 

followed the custom of the Arabians, Persians, Syrians, and other 
Eastern nations in making use of unguents at their feasts for 
purposes of refreshment, and as a hindrance to drunkenness. 
Moreover, those ointments were not unfrequently not thick, such 
as those which doctors make use of for blows and wounds, but 
in a liquid state. They were confections of odoriferous herbs, 
which refreshed and delighted the brain and the other parts of 
the body. This particular ointment was fluid spikenard, as we 
learn from S. John. Spikenard has a very sweet smell, and 
abounds in Syria. Whence Tibullus, “His temples lately moist 
with Tyrian (or better, Syrian) nard.” It is certain that spikenard 
compounded with oil formed a very precious ointment, which 
the ancients made use of for anointing the head. (See Plin. 
lib. xiii. caps, i and 2.) 

Precious; Gr. )8a^ur/^ou, of great price; lit heavy , because 
money was formerly estimated according to weight, as by the 
ounce, the pound. The Syriac adds, it was very sweet ; S. Mark 
says, spicati (Vulg.) ; S. John, pistici. I will explain the meaning 
of these words in S. John xil 3. 

Upon Bis head. You will say that John has, she anointed the 
Jut of Jesus, &c. I answer that Mary Magdalene first anointed 
the feet of Christ and then poured all the contents of the vessel 
upon His head. To do this she broke off the narrow neck of 
the bottle, as we gather from S. Mark. So S. Augustine (lib. 
de Consens. Evangel. 79). John adds, she wiped His feet \ that is, 
before she anointed them, to cleanse them from dust For Jesus 
went about with the upper part of His feet uncovered, as I have 
shown, x. 10. So Toletus. But if any one shall maintain that 
she wiped Christ’s feet after the anointing, in order to dry them, 
I offer no objection. John, in order to show the surpassing 
excellence of the ointment, adds, And the house was

the odour. In the Magdalene, therefore, was fulfilled the words 
of Canticles i. 1 2, “ When the king was on his couch my spikenard 
gave its odour” (Vulg.). Also, “Thy name is as oil poured 
forth.” 

Tropologically : Origen says that oil or ointment is the work of 
virtue, especially of mercy. If this be shown out of natural 
compassion, as it is by infidels, not for God’s sake, God accepts 
it indeed, but not unto life eternal. But if it be done from love 
to God, it is an excellent ointment of a sweet-smelling savour. 
Again, if a good work be done to relieve the wants of the poor, 
it is an anointing of the feet of the Lord. For the poor in the 
Church are the mystical feet of the Lord. But if the work be 
done for the glory of God, as in the way of zeal for chastity, 
fasting, or prayer, it is an anointing of the Lord’s head, a precious 
ointment, with whose odour the whole Church is filled ; and this 
is the proper work of the perfect 

ad. The Gloss says, “This woman who anointed the head and 
feet of Christ signifies the faith of the Church, which, when it 
preaches and invokes the Godhead of Christ, anoints His head: 
when it preaches His humanity, His feet” 

Lastly, he anoints the feet, who in an active life serves his 
neighbour ; but he the head, who cleaves to God by contemplation, 
and becomes one spirit with Him. 

When the disciples saw it, &c. You may say that S. John 
speaks only of Judas as murmuring. S. Augustine (lib. 2, de 
Consens. Evang. c. 69) says that Judas was the leader and inciter 
of this murmuring, who stirred up the other Apostles, in the 
pretence of pity for the poor, to indignation, which in their case 
flowed from a real affection of pity, but with him was a mere 
pretence, springing from avarice. 

Sold for much . . . three hundred denarii, as Mark has. Judas 
meant to say that this ointment ought not to have been used for 
luxury and pleasure upon the head of Christ, but ought to have 
been poured into the lap of many poor, to relieve their wants. 
This was the opinion of Calvin, who, lest any one should make

use of the example of Mary Magdalene to approve of funereal 
honours, in the way of lights, incense, and other like observances, 
says that this action of hers must neither be approved nor imitated» 
but only defended, as done by a special inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost But who cannot see that the spirit of Judas and Calvin are 
identical ; and that the same Satan speaks by Calvin who erst spake 
by Judas, whom Christ proceeds to confute? 

But Jesus knowing , &c., — by the Divine Spirit their secret mur- 
muring, — said) Why trouble ye, &c. Arab. Why do you blame t 
A good work ; xaXtfr, i .e., fair, honourable , worthy of highest praise . 
For what can be more worthy and honourable than to anoint the 
feet of God ? Who would not account himself happy if he might 
but touch and kiss the feet of Christ ? 

The poor ye have always , &c. The world is full of poor, to 
whom ye may always do good; but I, after six days, am about 
to die, and go away to Heaven, so that ye will not be able 
either to see Me or to touch Me. Suffer then this woman’s act 
of service towards Me. In six days ye would vainly desire to 
do the like. 

For My burial. Christ might have excused Mary because of 
the excellence of His Divine Person, which was anointed by her, 
which made it more meritorious to expend the price of the 
ointment upon Him than upon feeding the poor, as Theophylact 
teaches. And the same argument holds good in the present 
day with respect to the adornment of temples, altars, chalices, 
&c. For this is done in honour of the person of Christ, to stir 
up the devotion and reverence of others towards Him, when 
there is no special necessity calling for the relief of the poor. 
Or Christ might have excused her, because she performed this 
anointing out of gratitude, piety, reverence. But out of modesty 
He was unwilling to make use of these pleas. His only ground 
of defence is, she did it for My burial, that He might show that 
His death was at hand, and that He was willing and ready to 
die, yea, that He had ordained the anointing with a view to 
His death, and so permitted the consequent betrayal of Judas.

IS 6 


S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


For Christ very greatly longed for His death, for the glory of 
God and the redemption of men. At the same time He, as it 
were, pricks Judas ; as S. Chrysostom says, “ I am troublesome 
and burdensome to you, but wait a little while, and I will depart 
hence. But take thou care lest, by betraying Me, thou promotest 
My death, lest thou bring death and hell upon thyself.” The 
Syriac adds, She did it as if for My burial \ because Mary did 
not intend to anoint Him for burial; but the Holy Ghost, 
knowing what was about to take place, inwardly moved her to 
do what she did. 

Christ therefore excuses her because of her inward affection of 
charity, because of the peculiar circumstances and the unique 
occasion, and especially because the Holy Ghost guided her, 
although she knew not what she did. For she anointed Him 
as though He had been on the very point of being buried. She 
could not anoint Him for burial after He was dead, because she 
was anticipated by Joseph of Arimathea. So Mark says distinctly, 
She hath done what she could ; she is come aforehand to anoint 
My body for the burial. S. John has, Let her alone , that she 
may keep (ut servet) it for the day of My burial (Vulg.). The 
Greek is in the past tense, she hath kept it. As though He had 
said, “ Suffer her, O Judas, to obey the instinct of her devotion, 
that she may anoint Me yet alive, though so soon about to 
die, for she will not be able to do it after I am dead.” So 
Vatablus. Otherwise Maldonatus, That she may keep it, “She 
has so bestowed this ointment in anointing Me that she cannot 
lose it” As if one should say that he had kept his money 
who had bought a field with it; for if he had hidden it in a 
coffer, he might have lost it That she may keep it — that she 
may be proved to have kept it (Franc Lucas). 

Somewhat differently Nonnus Panopolitanus, who read with 
the Vulg. Ira rqtfep, that she may keep , “Account this woman’s 
gift free from all blame, so that she may keep and preserve the 
treasure of My body until the hour of My death and preparation 
for burial be come.”

PRAISE OF MARY MAGDALENE. 


157 


Verify I say unto you . . . for a memorial of her, i.e. f of Mary 
Magdalene, not of Christ, as is shown by the fem. pronoun aur^;. 
This anointing and pious devotion shall be celebrated throughout 
the whole world for the everlasting praise and honour of Mary, 
and for the infamy of Judas, who found fault with her. Victor 
of Antioch paraphrases as follows, “So far am I from condemning 
her as though she had done amiss, or blaming her as though 
she had not acted aright, that I will never suffer this deed of 
hers to be forgotten in all time to come. Yea, the whole world 
shall know what she did in a house and in obscurity. For 
she did it with a pious mind, and with fervent faith and a 
contrite heart What was done was pleasing, not so much 
because of the money that was spent, as because of the faith 
which she offered together with the ointment For this was to 
Me as the most fragrant of all odours.” 

Then went away (abiit) one of the twelve, &c. The word then 
refers partly to what has immediately preceded, and partly to the 
council of the rulers about taking Christ in the 16th verse. It 
means that on the Saturday before Palm Sunday, when Judas, 
the instigator of the murmuring, found himself rebuked by Christ, 
he did not repent as the other Apostles, whom he had misled, did, 
but then he made his forehead brazen, and clothed himself with 
the cloak of impudence, and, mad with covetousness and wicked- 
ness, he determined to sell and betray Christ to the Jews. 
Therefore on the following Wednesday, when the rulers were 
taking counsel as to the way in which they might lay hold on 
Christ, he came to them, and suggested a method, and stipulated 
to deliver Him into their hands for thirty pieces of silver. 

One of the twelve . An Apostle, not one even of Christ’s 
seventy disciples, or He might the better have borne it, but one 
of the twelve Apostles, and of His own most intimate friends, 
whom He had elevated to that lofty rank. So this was the 
dark ingratitude and wickedness of Judas, which pierced the 
heart of Christ, so that He said, “If mine enemy had spoken 
evil of Me, I would have borne it,” &c. “But thou, the man

united to me, my guide and my familiar friend ! We took sweet 
counsel together, and walked in the house of God by consent" 
(Ps. lv. 13, &c). Wherefore S. Augustine ( Tract 61 in Joan.) 
says, “ One by vocation, not by predestination ; in number, not in 
merit ; in body, not in spirit ; in appearance, not in reality." 

He went away . Satan having entered into him, as Mark has, 
not that Satan insinuated himself into the soul of Judas, and so 
inclined his will and intellect to betray Christ. For God alone is 
able to glide into the soul, as Didymus rightly teaches (Tract, 3, de 
Spiritu Sancto ). Neither was it that Satan took bodily possession 
of Judas, in the same way that he possesses energumens , but that 
he presented reasons suited to his imagination, which induced 
him to betray Christ, as S. John shows, xiii. a. The same 
Evangelist says in the 27th verse, that after supper, when Judas 
had received the morsel from Christ, Satan entered into him, 
in order that he might accomplish in act the treachery which he 
had already purposed in his mind. This expression shows also 
the horrible atrocity of Judas’ wickedness, as though a man were 
not sufficient for its perpetration, but there were need of the help 
and instigation of the devil. 

And he said unto them , , What will ye give me, &c. “Unhappy 
Judas,” says S. Jerome, “wishes to recompense himself for the 
loss which he deemed he had sustained by the pouring forth of 
the oil, by selling his Master. Nor does he even demand a 
certain sum, so that his treachery might at least seem profitable, 
but as though he were disposing of a worthless slave, he left the 
price to the option of the buyers." 

So S. Jerome, who thinks that Judas did not stipulate for any 
fixed sum, but left it to be determined by the rulers, as though 
he had said, “ Give me what you will” But others, with greater 
probability, say that Judas bargained with the rulers thus, “I 
will sell Christ to you, but for so great a person, and for one 
whom you hate so much, I demand a suitable price. How much 
will ye give me?” 

Thirty pieces of silver . See the vileness of Judas in valuing

VALUE OF THE SILVER PIECES. 


159 


Christ, the Saviour of the world, his Master and his Lord, for 
such a miserable sum. This vileness afflicted Christ with great 
sorrow. Wherefore S. Ambrose says (lib, de Spirit, Sand, c, 18), 
“ O Judas, the traitor, thou valuest the ointment of His Passion 
at 300 denarii, and His Passion itself at thirty, — rich in valuing, 
cheap in crime ! ” 

You will ask what was the weight and value of these thirty pieces 
of silver. Baronius (ex Helia in Tisbi \ R, David, \ and other more 
modem Rabbins ) thinks that the silver piece of Zechariah and the 
prophets, and consequently of this passage of S. Matthew, as is 
plain from xxvii 9, is a pound of silver. This would amount 
to about 1000 Flemish florins. But who can believe that the 
covetous Jews would pay such a sum to Judas, of his own 
accord making the offer, not to sell, but only to betray and guide 
them to a man who was daily to be met with, especially since 
the Fathers and Zechariah marvel at the price as being so small 
and poor? 

With greater probability, Maldonatus and others understand 
thirty shekels to be here intended, which would be equal in value 
to thirty Flemish florins. This was the price at which a slave, 
who had been killed, was estimated, according to the law in Exod. 
xxi. 32. Thus the life of Christ was valued by Judas and the 
Jews at the same price as that of a slave. 

But since Jeremiah (xxxiL 9) distinguishes the slater f or the 
shekel, which is the Hebrew word, from the silver piece, for he 
says, “ Weigh for it the silver, seven staters and ten silver pieces ” 
( Vulg, following the Heb, See also the margin of the English 
Version ), it would seem more probable that these silver pieces of 
Judas were half shekels or double denarii, I have been the more 
confirmed in this opinion from seeing in the Church of the Holy 
Cross of Jerusalem at Rome, together with a portion of the true 
Cross brought thither by S. Helena, one of those silver pieces 
for which Christ was sold. This is about the size of a Spanish 
real, but a little thicker. Hence, also, Zacharias calls the price, 
ironically, due or fitting', Ang. Vers, goodly. The shekel was equal

i6o 


S. MATTHEW, c. XXVI. 


to a Flemish florin, so that the thirty pieces of silver would be 
equal to fifteen Flemish florins. 

You will ask how could “the potter's field” be bought for 
such a sum as this ? I answer, that the Heb. H'jb', scuU> and the 
Syr. ^j?n, ehakel, Le., a field \ is put for any piece of land, however 
sandy, stony, or barren, such as sand-pits, which this “field” 
probably was. It seems to have been useless for agricultural 
purposes, and of very small value, like the Jewish cemeteries 
outside the cities of Germany. It is also possible that the rulers 
may have supplemented the thirty pieces of silver by a grant 
from the corbana , or treasury. 

Observe : Joseph being sold by his brethren was a type of this 
selling of Christ But Joseph was sold for twenty pieces of silver, 
for it was not fitting, says S. Jerome, that the servant should be 
sold for as much as his Master. 

Observe secondly: Judas, according to S. Ambrose, received 
the tenth part of the price of the ointment with which Christ was 
anointed, which was valued at 300 denarii. But it is more pro- 
bable that he received the fifth part, for the silver piece of Judas 
seems to have been, as has been said, a double denarius . 

Thirdly, because Christ was sold at so vile a price, therefore 
He deserved to become the price of the whole world, and of all 
sinners. 

Fourthly, because of these thirty pieces of silver, with which 
Judas and the Jews trafficked for Christ, God smites them with 
thirty curses in the 109th Psalm. The first is, “Set Thou an 
ungodly man to be ruler over him.” The second, “Let the devil 
stand at his right hand.” The third, “When he is judged, let him 
be condemned.” The fourth, “ Let his prayer be turned into sin.” 
The fifth, “Let his days be few.” The sixth, “His bishopric 
let another take,” and so on. Lastly, as Hegesippus says, thirty 
Jews, who were taken captive by Titus, were sold for one 
denarius.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE PASSION. l6l 

Origen : u Such an opportunity as he sought, Luke explains by 
saying, he sought ... in the absence of the multitude^ that is to 
say, when the people were not about Him ; but He was in private 
with His disciples. This also he did, betraying Him at night 
after supper, in the garden of Gethsemane, whither He had 
retired.” 

Ver. 17. On the first day of unleavened breads &c. The Pass- 
over was to be eaten with unleavened , that is, pure unfermented 
bread, according to the Law. This abstinence from leaven lasted 
seven days, and the first day of unleavened bread was the first 
day of the Passover. The Pasch or Passover was celebrated on 
the 14th day of the first month, at even ; that is to say, on the full 
moon of the month called Nisan, which was that in which fell 
the full moon of the vernal equinox. Wherefore, Nisan answers 
partly to our March and partly to April 

The following is the chronology of the last eight days of the 
life of Christ On the Friday, which was the 8th day of Nisan, He 
came from Ephrem to Bethany. The next day, being the Sabbath, 
He sups in the house of Simon the leper. The day following 
was the 10th of Nisan, and Palm Sunday. On the nth of Nisan, 
He taught in the Temple, and cursed the barren fig-tree. On the 
1 2th, He foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, and spake the 
parables recorded in S. Matthew xxiv. and xxv. On the 13th of 
Nisan, or Wednesday, the rulers held their council, when Judas 
sold Him to them. On the 14th of Nisan, He instituted the 
Eucharist. On the 15 th, He was crucified. The 16th of Nisan 
was Saturday, when He lay in the tomb. The 17th of Nisan was 
Easter Sunday. 

On the first day of unleavened bread, , that is, the 14th day of 
Nisan, or the full moon, Christ about mid-day sent two of His 
disciples from Bethany to Jerusalem to prepare and roast the 
paschal lamb, that He might eat it with them in the evening. 
Here observe, that the first day of unleavened bread is sometimes 
called the 14th of Nisan and sometimes the 15th. For that even- 
ing in which the Jews celebrated the Pasch, with which the days

and the eating of unleavened bread commenced, according to the 
natural computation of time, pertained to the fourteenth day, but 
according to the computation observed with respect to festivals, it 
pertained to the following day, or the 15th of Nisan. 

You will ask, What was the precise day on which Christ ate 
the Passover and instituted the Eucharist? Was it the same 
day on which the Jews kept the Pasch, or was it another? I 
take it for granted that, according to the belief of the whole 
Church, Christ was crucified on Friday, and therefore that He 
ate the paschal lamb at supper the day before, or on Thursday 
evening. 

isb Euthymius and the Greeks say that Christ celebrated the 
Pasch on the 13th of Nisan ; that He anticipated the time fixed by 
the Law for the Passover, on account of His Passion, which was 
about to be on the next day, on which the Jews celebrated the 
Passover. And because the use of azyms, or unleavened bread, 
began with the Passover on the following day, they think that 
Christ instituted the Eucharist before the azyms, and in leavened 
bread. Therefore they celebrate in leavened bread ; and they say 
that this is a command. Whence they condemn the Latins for 
celebrating in unleavened bread, and call them Azymites and 
heretics. And they wash their altars before they will celebrate 
upon them, as deeming them polluted with unleavened bread. 
They dte in favour of their view & John xiii. 1, a, who says, 
before the feast of the Passover (that is, before the fourteenth day of 
the moon, when they began to eat unleavened bread) Christ made 
His supper. 

ad. Rupertus, Jansen, Maldonatus, and Salmeron, who enters at 
length into the subject (tract. 9, tom. 4), say that Christ celebrated 
the Pasch according to the Law on the 14th of Nisan, but that the 
Jews deferred it until the 15th, an opinion thought to be supported 
by S. John. For there was a tradition, says Burgensis (ex Seder 
Oiam) t that if the Passover fell on the Friday, or the preparation 
for the Sabbath, it was transferred to the following day, which was 
the Sabbath, or Saturday, lest two solemn festivals, the Passover

DAY OF THE PASSOVER. 


163 


and the Sabbath, should concur.* But this tradition is later than 
the time of Christ, as may be proved from the Talmud and Aben 
Ezra. 

With these I say that both Christ and the Jews celebrated the 
Passover on the same day prescribed by the l^aw, namely, on the 
14th day of Nisan, in the evening. That this was so, appears from 
Matthew, Mark, and Luke, who say that Christ celebrated the 
Passover on the first day of unleavened bread, on which the Pass- 
over must (by the Law) he killed . And on which day they (/>., the 
Jews) killed the Passover . Had it been otherwise, the Jews would 
have proved and condemned Christ to be a transgressor of the 
Law. 

You may object, 1st If Christ celebrated the Passover on the 
14th of Nisan, why do Matthew, Mark, and Luke say that He 
celebrated it on the first day of unleavened bread, which fell upon 
the fifteenth day ? The answer is, as I have already said, that the 
first day of the azyms was partly the 14th and partly the 15th of 
Nisan. For that evening on which the Jews celebrated the Pass- 
over, with which began the days and the use of unleavened bread, 
pertained, according to the natural reckoning of time, to the day 
which preceded the evening, that is, to the 14th of Nisan. But the 
same evening pertained, according to the festal reckoning, to the 
day following, which was the 15th of Nisan. And in this sense 
John says that Christ supped upon the paschal lamb before the feast 
of the Passover, which was the 15th of Nisan, according to the 
festal reckoning. 

You will object, 2d. That it is said, John xviii. 28, that the 
Jews did not enter the prcetorium lest they should be defiled , but that 
they 9 being pure, might eat a pure Pasch. I answer, Passover, in 
that place, does not signify the paschal lamb, for that had been 


* Ne concurrent is the Latin. In order to understand d Lapide , it must be 
borne in mind that according to the Jewish festival computation of time, our 
Lord in keeping the Passover on Thursday evening was really keeping it on 
the 15th of Nisan, or the Friday, according to the natural reckoning of time.—

already sacrificed and eaten the evening before, but the other 
paschal victims, which they were wont to immolate on the seven 
following days, but especially on the first day of the azyms, that 
is, on the morning of the 15th day of Nisan, according to the 
Law. 

You will object, 3d. John (xix. 21) calls the 15th of Nisan, on 
which Christ celebrated the paschal supper, the preparation of the 
Passover. I answer yes, of the Passover , that is, of the Paschal 
Sabbath, or the Sabbath which fell within the octave of the Paschal 
Feast, which was for that reason more thought of than other 
Sabbaths. As S. John adds by way of explanation, *or that 
Sabbath-day was a high day . This appears also from Mark xv. 32, 
who calls this preparation day the day before the Sabbath. For on 
the preparation day, that is, the Friday, they prepared food and 
other necessaries for the following day, which was the Sabbath. 
For on this Sabbath, as being most holy, they abstained from 
every kind of work, even from preparing food, which was allowable 
on other festivals. 

You will object, 4th. That the rulers say in Matt xxvl 5, Let 
us put Christ to death, but not on the feast day . I reply that, after 
the treachery of Judas, they changed their counsel; and they did 
put Him to death on the feast day. 

The disciples came , — two, says S. Mark; Peter and John, S. Luke. 
Where t — this is not to ask the city or town, but the house. They 
were certain from the Law (Deut. xvi. 5-7) that the Passover could 
not be offered anywhere save at Jerusalem. The paschal lamb, 
however, was not immolated in the temple by the priests, but at 
home, by each master of a household, who for this purpose retained 
the ancient right of the priesthood, which was originally given to 
each first-born son of a family. Philo shows this at length (lib. de 
Decalogo, sub finem) : “ Every one ordinarily sacrifices the Passover 
without waiting for the priest; for they in this case, by the per- 
mission of the Law, discharge the office of the priest” For the 
sacrifice of the paschal lamb consisted rather in the eating thereof, 
than in the immolation. Whence the disciples say, eat the Passover.

Hence, also, it might be slain, immolated, flayed, and roasted, not 
indeed by common butchers, but either by a priest, or by that 
member of a family whom its head should appoint Thus Peter 
and John, who were here sent by Christ, killed and made ready 
the lamb, and prepared the unleavened bread, and the wild herbs 
with which the lamb was to be eaten. The lamb was wont to 
be slain at the ninth hour, or three o’clock in the afternoon, as 
Josephus says {lib. 7, de Bell. c. 1 7). 

Go into the city : Jerusalem. From this it is plain that Christ 
said these things in Bethany. To such a one , and say. Such a 
one ; this is the Hebrew idiom, when any one is intended whose 
name is not mentioned. However, He indicates him by certain 
marks, as S. Mark signifies : “ And He sendeth forth two of His 
disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall 
meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him. And 
wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the good man of the house, 
The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat 
the Passover with My disciples? And he will show you a large 
upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. 
And His disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found 
as He had said unto them ; and they made ready the Passover. 

Where observe, that it is plain from S. Mark’s words that this 
water-carrier, who guided them to the house, was not the master of 
the house. This latter appears to have been a wealthy man, who 
possessed a spacious mansion, and who was probably a friend 
and disciple of Christ The tradition is, that this house belonged 
to John, whose surname was Mark, the companion of Paul and 
Barnabas/ This was the house in which the Apostles lay concealed 
after the death of Christ. In it Christ appeared to them in the 
evening of the day of His resurrection. And in the same house 
they received the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. Wherefore also Peter, 
when he was delivered by the angel out of the prison into which 
he had been cast by Herod, betook himself to the believers who 
were gathered together in this same house {see Acts xii. 12). 
Wherefore, this house was converted into a church. For in it was

Sion builded up, which is the greatest and the holiest of all 
churches. Alexander shows all these things in his Life of the 
Apostle S. Barnabas . He is followed by Baronius and many 
others. For where My refreshment is, as the Vulgate of S. Matt 
(ver. 14) translates, the Greek has xardXvfia, inn or lodging. The 
Greek for chamber is arwyewr, an upper floor, or chamber, or flat, 
such as are inhabited at Rome by wealthy people. Wherefore it 
is a type of the Church, which is lending from earth to Heaven. 

My time, ue., the time of My death, and of finishing the work 
which My Father sent Me to do. 

Ver. 19. And the disciples, viz., Peter and John, did as Jesus 
had appointed them: they killed and roasted the paschal lamb. 
Now the lamb, prepared for roasting, set forth the image of 
Christ crucified. For as S. Justin (contr. Tryph.) teaches, the 
body of the lamb was pierced through with the spit The hind- 
feet, as well as the fore-feet, which stood in the place of hands, 
were distended, and held apart by little sticks inserted in the 
hollows of the feet As if the spit signified the longitudinal 
portion of the cross, and the little stakes the transverse bars, 
together with the nails driven into the hands and feet of the 
Divine Lamb. For the fire of His affliction was no less than 
the fire by which the paschal lamb was roasted. “Why,” asks 
Franc. Lucas, “do lambs always bear the marks of wounds in 
the hollow of their feet, in a manner not unlike to those which 
our Saviour retained from the piercing of the nails upon the 
cross?” Christ then, when He came to the house, and beheld 
the roasted lamb, beheld in it a lively image of His own cruci- 
fixion. Wherefore He offered this lamb, as it were a type of 
Himself, or rather He offered up Himself, a whole burnt-offering, 
and as it were a Victim for the sins of the whole world, with a

When the evening was come, &c. For in the evening, according

promise. But Jesus is said to have lain down ( diseubuisse ) with 
His disciples, because the ancients were accustomed at supper 
to recline upon couches ; that is to say, with the lower portion of 
the body they were in a recumbent position, but with their arms 
they leant upon supports, as though they were sitting at table. 
Mark (xiv. 17) has, when it was evening He came with the twelve m 
Speaking precisely, there were ten, since two had been pre 
viously sent to prepare the Passover, and were already on the 
spot 

You will ask, Was Judas the traitor present at the celebration 
of the Passover and the Eucharist? And did he partake of it? 
S. Hilary and Theophvlact (in loci) say, No. So do Clemens 
Romanus (lib. 5, Constit. c. 16), Innocent III. (lib. de Myster. 
Euchar. c. 13), and Rupertus (lib. 10, in Matth.). S. Dionysius (de 
Eccles. Hierar.) is thought by some to favour the same opinion; 
but other writers, as S. Thomas, take S. Dionysius to incline to 
the opposite view. Theophylact also may be taken both ways. 
The reason why the above writers think that Judas did not 
partake is, because a traitor was unworthy of so great Mysteries, 
and one who must be forbidden to assist at them. 

But that Judas was present at the Passover and the Eucharist, 
and that he did communicate with the rest of the Apostles, is 
the common opinion of all other Fathers and Doctors, namely, 
Origen, Cyril, Chrysostom, Ambrose, SS. Leo, Cyprian, Austin, 
Bede, Rabanus, S. Thomas, and others, whom Suarez cites and 
follows (3 part, quasi. 73, art. 5, disp. 41, sect. 3), where he 
maintains that S. Dionysius also held' the same opinion. For 
Dionysius says thus, “And the Author Himself (Christ) of the 
Creeds most justly separates him, who not as He Himself, nor 
in like manner, with sacred simplicity, had supped with Him.” 
Which means, Christ separates Judas from the company of 
Himself and His Apostles, saying to him, “What thou doest, 
do quickly,” because he had supped and taken the Eucharist 
unworthily with Him. For presently, after his unworthy com- 
municating, Satan entered into him, and compelled him to

accomplish his betrayal of Christ, as SS. Chrysostom, Cyril, and 
Austin teach. 

This opinion is proved — ist Because Matthew here says that 
Christ sat down to the Supper of the lamb and the Eucharist 
with the twelve Apostles — therefore with Judas. Whence in the 
a i st verse it follows, And when they were eatings He said unto 
them , Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray Me . 2d. 

Because Mark (xiv. 23) says concerning the Eucharistic Chalice, 
And they all drank of it 3d. Because Luke says that, after the 
consecration of the Chalice, Christ immediately added, Nevertheless 
the hand of him that betrayeth Me is with Me on the table. 4th. 
Because John (chap, xiii.), when he relates that Christ, before the 
Eucharistic Feast, washed the Apostles’ feet, signifies that He 
washed the feet of Judas, for He says, Ye are clean, but not all, 
for He knew who would betray Him. If, then, Christ washed the 
feet of Judas, He also gave him the Eucharist ; for this washing 
was preparatory to the Eucharistic Feast 5th: Because Christ, 
after the Eucharistic Supper, said that one of them who were 
reclining with Him at the table, meaning Judas, was His betrayer. 
And when John asked, Who was this betrayer ? Christ answered 
(xiii. 26), It is he to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped 
it. And when He had dipped the piece of bread (Vulg.), He gave 
it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 

The a priori reason is, that although Christ might properly 
have made known to the Apostles the hidden treachery of Judas, 
for the manifestation of His Divinity and His love, both because 
He was the lord of the character (fames ) of Judas, as well as 
because the treason of Judas was already known to others, 
that is, to the princes and elders, and was very shortly to become 
known to the Apostles themselves by the course of events, yet 
was He unwilling to do this, that He might give an example of 
perfect charity, and that He might by this means draw Juda3 
to repentance. Lastly, He would show that secret sinners must 
not be publicly traduced nor prohibited from coming to the 
celebration of Holy Communion. Wherefore, when Christ, in

JUDAS MADE A PRIEST.

instituting the Eucharist, made the Apostles priests and bishops 
when he said, Do this in commemoration of Me, it follows that 
He created Judas also* who was present, a priest and a bishop. 
Wherefore it is said concerning him in the 109th Psalm, “And 
his bishopric let another take.” For S. Peter interprets this of 
Judas in the 1st chapter of the Acts. For although the Hebrew 
of the passage in the Psalm is pecuddato, Le., prefecture, meaning his 
Apostleship , yet there is no reason why it should not be properly 
understood of Bishopric, as Suarez takes it Lastly, it is plain 
that none others, except the twelve Apostles, were present at the 
Supper and the Eucharist For these twelve only are mentioned. 
This against Euthymius, who thinks that others were present. 

And whilst they were eating, &c. Matthew says that Christ 
spake this before the institution of the Eucharist, but Luke 
(xxii. 22) says after it. And this seems more probable. For 
Christ would be unwilling to trouble the minds of His disciples 
with such dreadful news before the Eucharist Rather would 
He have them wholly intent upon, and devoted to the considera- 
tion of so great a Sacrament. Wherefore S. Matthew speaks by 
way of anticipation. Although S. Austin thinks (lib. 3, de Consens. 
Evang. c. 1) that Christ spake thus twice, both before and after 
the Eucharist 

About to betray (Vulg.), i.e., in a few hours to deliver up. 
Christ spoke thus, as well to show that He was conscious of 
the treachery, as that, not against His will, but voluntarily, He 
suffered. Wherefore He did not flee away, but offered Himself 
to His betrayer. He did it also to prick the conscience of Judas 
and arouse him to repentance. So S. Jerome says, “He casts 
the accusation generally, that the conscience of the guilty one 
might lead him to repentance.” Christ did not name Judas for 
three reasons. 1st. For the sake of his good name, and to teach 
us to act in like manner. 2d. Lest Peter and the Apostles 
should rise up against Judas, and tear him to pieces. 3d. That 
by this gentleness and charity He might provoke Judas to 
repentance. Wherefore S. Leo says (Serm. 7, de Passione), “He

made it plain to the traitor that his inmost heart was known to 
Him, not confounding the impious one by a rough or open 
rebuke, but convicting him by a gentle and quiet admonition, 
that He might the more easily correct, by bringing to repentance, 
him whom no charge had robbed of his good name. 1 ’ 

And they were exceeding sorry , &c Syr. They were vehemently 
troubled. Lord> is it Jt Syr. Mort\ i.e., My Lord, \ is it It 
For very greatly did they grieve that Christ their Lord, their 
Parent and their Master, upon whom they wholly depended, was. 
to be torn from them, and to die, and that* through treachery, 
which was to be perpetrated by one of their own college, which 
would be the greatest injury, and occasion the utmost infamy to 
the entire college. Wherefore these words of Christ transfixed 
their hearts as with a swoid, and, says S. Chrysostom, “they 
became half dead.” 

One by one : therefore Judas lest if he alone kept silence 
should betray himself, or render himself suspected to the rest of 
the Apostles. For, as Origen says, “I think that at first he 
thought he might lie hid as a man. But when afterwards he 
saw that his heart was known to Christ, he embraced the op- 
portunity of concealment offered by Christ’s words.” His first 
action was one of unbelief, his second of impudence. Now the 
other Apostles all said, Is it It because, although their conscience 
did not accuse them of such a crime, yet, as S. Chrysostom says, 
they believed the words of Christ rather than their own conscience. 
Because, as S. Austin says in another place, “There is no sin 
which a man has done, which a man may not do, if the Ruler, 
by whom man was made, be absent from him.” 

He that dippeth his hand 9 &c. Dippeth ; Gr. i i.u/ta^ac, aorist, 
who dipped \ or who is accustomed to dip. It appears that Judas, 
in order the better to conceal his treachery, and show himself 
a friend to Christ, the more frequently dipped bread, or flesh, 
into the vessel of broth, or vinegar, or condiment But inas- 
much as the other Apostles were wont to do the same thing 
to some extent, they could not know that Judas* was certainly

designated as the traitor by these words of Christ. Whence they 
strove to get at the fact by means of other questions addressed 
to Him. 

Here take notice, for the harmony of the Evangelists, who 
relate diversely the pointing out of Judas the traitor, that the 
following is the historical order which harmonises all the Gospels 
with one another. First, Christ before the Eucharist foretold 
that He should be betrayed by one of the Apostles. But this 
He did in a general manner, without naming or indicating any 
individual. This is plain from Matthew and Mark. Afterwards, 
when the Apostles asked one by one, Lord, is it It Christ 
answered, that “he was the traitor, who dipped his hand with 
Him in the dish.” For the ancients were wont to recline at table 
on couches by threes and fours, as I have shown on Esther L 6. 
Each three or four, therefore, had a common dish, in such a 
way, that those who reclined on opposite couches might have 
the same dish. Therefore, because several of the Apostles had 
the same dish, Christ did not by those words indicate precisely 
who was the traitor. After this Christ instituted the Eucharist. 
And when this was finished, He again said that the traitor was 
with Him at the table, as S. Luke relates at length ; on which 
I have* said more on S. John xiii. ai. Whereupon Peter made 
signs to John, who was reclining upon the bosom of Christ, to 
ask Him definitely, and by name, who was the traitor. John then 
asked, and to him Christ answered, “that it was he to whom 
He was about to give a morsel,” which presently He gives to 
Judas. Judas having received it, and feeling that he was desig- 
nated both by his own consciousness of his guilt and by the sign 
which Christ gave, impudently asks, Rabbi, is it It Christ 
answered, Thou hast said, that is, thou art he. Wherefore he 
seemed to himself altogether detected, goes forth, as it were, in 
madness and rage to accomplish the betrayal of Christ, and goes 
to the house ol Caiaphas, to ask for servants and officers to take 
Christ.

that man if he had not been born. For “ far better is it not to exist 
at all, than to exist in evil The punishment is foretold, that him 
whom shame had not conquered, the denunciation of punishment 
might correct,” says S. Jerome. He threatens him with the woe 
of damnation. For far better is it not to be, than to exist only 
to be endlessly miserable, as I have shown on Eccles. iv. 2, 3. 
Wisely does S. Jerome say (Fpist. ad Furiam ), “ It is not their 
beginning which is inquired about in Christians, but their ending. 
Paul began badly but ended well Judas* beginning was com- 

r 

mended, but his end was to be condemned as a traitor.” 

Goeth. “ By this word,” says Victor of Antioch, “ Christ showeth 
that His death is like rather to a departure or passing away, than 
to real death. He signifies, likewise, by it that He went volun- 
tarily to death.” Moreover, the betrayal of Judas was an act of 
infinite sacrilege, perpetrated directly against the very Person of 
Christ and God. Thus it was true deicide. Wherefore it is ex- 
ceedingly probable that Judas abides in the deepest pit of Gehenna, 
near to Lucifer, and is there grievously tormented. And this seems 
to be indicated by the word woe, which Christ here pronounces 
upon him above the rest of the reprobates. Blessed Francis Borgia 
was wont, in meditation, in the depth of his humility, to place 
himself at the feet of Judas, that is to say, in the lowest pit of 
hell, exclaiming that there was no other place fit for him, neither 
in Heaven, nor in earth, nor under the earth, as the due reward 
of his sins. 

Ver. 25. Judas answered ... Is it It Franc. Lucas thinks, with 
probability, that Judas asked this question after Christ had given 
him the morsel of bread. 

Now Judas asked this question out of impudence, to cover his 
wickedness ; and, as Jerome says, “ by boldness to lay a lying claim 
to a good conscience.” For he thought that Christ, out of gentle- 
ness, would not name His betrayer. As though he had said, 
“Surely it is not I, O Christ, who am Thy betrayer? I who have 
faithfully served Thee all these years ? Who have fed Thy family, 
and executed all Thy business?”

Thou hast said. This is the modest Hebrew method of 
answering, by which they confirm what is asked As though 
Christ said, 11 It is not that I say it, and call thee traitor. It is 
thou thyself who in reality dost call thyself so because thou art, 
in truth, a traitor.” Whence S. Chrysostom extols the meekness 
of Christ, who, in just anger, did not say, “Thou wicked and 
sacrilegious wretch I thou ungrateful traitor!” but gently, Thou 
hast said. “Thus has He fixed for us the bounds and rules of 
forbearance and forgetfulness of injuries.” 

Ver. 26. Whilst they were at supper , &c. This is My Body. 
Thus the Syriac, Arabic, and Persian. But the Ethiopic more 
significantly renders, This is My very Flesh. The Egyptian adds 
for: For this is My Body. The rest, indeed, understand for. 
For that the word must here be supplied is sufficiently plain 
from the account of the consecration of the wine in ver. 28, 
For this is My Blood. The word for gives the reason why they 
must eat and drink, namely, because it is the Body and Blood 
of Christ which are offered to them by Him to be eaten and 
drunken. For who would not most eagerly receive such Divine 
and precious meat and drink ? 

At supper , i.e., after the supper , as Luke and Paul have it, 
of the paschal lamb, but whilst they were still reclining at the 
table as it was spread for the feast Therefore Matthew says, 
whilst they were at supper. Here take notice that this supper 
of Christ was threefold. First, that of the paschal lamb, which 
Christ and His Apostles celebrated standing, according to the 
law in Exod. xiL Secondly, a common supper of other food after 
the lamb, which they ate reclining upon couches. For all the 
members of a family, especially if it were a numerous one, would 
not have sufficient food in the lamb alone. Thirdly, Christ added 
a most sacred, yea, a Divine Supper, that is to say, the institution 
of the Eucharist For Christ before the Eucharist partook of 
the lamb and the ordinary supper, since it was fitting that the 
type of the lamb should precede the Eucharistic Verity ; and that 
the Eucharist should be the final memorial of Him whQ was

about to die, as it were the highest pledge of love. So Jansen, 
Maldonatus, and others. Suarez, however, in speaking of this 
passage, thinks that the Eucharist was instituted between the 
paschal and the ordinary supper. At present, indeed, for the 
sake of reverence of so great a Sacrament, it is, says S. Augustine 
( Epist . 128), an Apostolic tradition that the Eucharist should only 
be taken by those who are fasting. Wherefore the heretics falsely 
and deceitfully call the Eucharist “the Supper,” although it be 
true the first Christians for some time celebrated the Eucharist 
at supper, after the example of Christ, as we gather from 1 Cor. 
xi. 25. Moreover, in the place of the second and ordinary 
supper, which Paul calls the Lord's Supper , there succeeded in 
ancient times, among Christians, the Agape, that is, a feast 
common to all, as a sign and incentive of charity, but taken 
after the reception of the Eucharist. Lastly, Christ, after the 
supper upon the lamb and the ordinary supper, but before the 
institution of the Eucharist, washed the disciples* feet He did 
this to signify with what purity we ought to approach so great 
Mysteries. This is plain from John xiil 4. After the washing, 
He took and consecrated bread and wine, which were still upon 
the table, and converted them into the Eucharist, that is, into 
His own Body and Blood. 

From all this it is gathered that Christ instituted the Eucharist 
about the first or second hour of the night For after taking the 
Eucharist, Judas went out to summon the servants of the rulers, 
that they might seize Christ Christ in the meanwhile delivered 
His prolonged discourse, of which John gives an account, 
chaps, xiv.-xvii. When this was ended, He went out to the 
Mount of Olives, and there continued a long time in prayer. 
Then He was taken by the Jews and dragged back from 

Gethsemane to Jerusalem. Then He was taken to Annas, and 

after that to Caiaphas. Still there was a great part of the night 

left, during which He was beaten by the hands of the servants 

of the priests, was spat upon and mocked by them, whilst they 
were waiting for the day, that they might take Him to Pilate

to be condemned. From all this it appears that Christ instituted 
the Eucharist about the beginning of Thursday night. 

Lastly, listen to the Council of Trent (Sess. 22, c 1): “After 
Christ had celebrated the ancient Passover, which the multitude 
of the sons of Israel sacrificed in memory of their going out of 
Egypt, He instituted a new Passover, that He Himself should be 
immolated by the Church (ab ecclesid ), by means of (per ) the 
priests, under (sub) visible signs, in memory of His passage from 
this world to the Father, when He redeemed us by the shedding 
of His Blood, and delivered us from the power of darkness, and 
translated us to His Kingdom.” 

Jesus took bread. Observe here five actions of Christ 1st He 
took bread. 2d. He gave thanks to the Father. 3d. He blessed 
bread. 4th. He brake bread. 5th. He extended it, and as He 
was extending it to them He said, Take and eat; this is My 
Body. For these are the words by which He offered it to them 
as well as by which He consecrated it This annihilates Calvin’s 
argument, who says, all these words, namely, took, blessed, brake , 
gave, have respect only unto bread. Therefore the Apostles re- 
ceived and ate bread, not the Body of Christ. I reply to the 
major premiss: These words refer to bread, not as it remained 
bread, but as it was in the act of being bestowed (inter dandum), 
changed by virtue of the words and consecration of Christ into 
the Body of Christ For thus might Christ have said at Cana of 
Galilee, “Take and drink, for this is wine,” if He had wished 
by these words to turn water into wine. For so we say in 
ordinary speech, “Herod shut up S. John in prison, killed and 
buried him, or permitted him to be buried.” And yet it was 
not the same that he shut up in prison whom he buried. For 
he imprisoned a man, he buried a corpse. After a similar and 
common way of speaking is what the Evangelists and S. Paul 
say of the Eucharist. 

Observe, secondly, from what Christ said, Take ye, for this is, 
&c., it would seem that Christ took one loaf, and during the 
act of consecration broke it into twelve parts, and gave one of

these parts to each of the Apostles, which they appear to have 
received in their hands. Wherefore also, for a long time in the 
Church, the Eucharist was given to the faithful in their hands, 
as is plain from Tertullian {lib. de Spectac .), and from S. Cryil 
of Jerusalem {Catechesi Mystagog. 5), and from S. Austin (Serin. 
244). Afterwards, however, from fear of desecration, and through 
reverence, it was given in the mouth. 

Lastly, the Apostles were not troubled at this unaccustomed 
action of Christ, and this new and wonderful Sacrament, for two 
reasons. First, because they had been already instructed and 
premonished (John vi.), as S. Chrysostom teaches (Horn. 83, in 
Maitk.). The other, because the same Christ who delivered 
the Mysteries, illuminated their minds by faith, that they might 
simply believe. For they had heard and believed many other 
more marvellous things without being troubled; as, chiefly that 
that Man, whom they saw eat, drink, sleep, be weary, was true 
God. Yea, that He was in Heaven at the very same time that 
He was speaking with them on earth, when He said (John 
iii. 13), “And no man hath ascended up to Heaven, but He that 
came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in 
Heaven. 

Blessed. Observe, Christ before consecration, 1st gave thanks 
to God the Father, as Luke and Paul say ; and that, after His 
manner, with His eyes lifted up to Heaven, as it is in the Canon 
of the Mass and the Liturgy of S. James. Whence this Sacrament 
is called the Eucharist, ie, 9 Giving of Thanks, because it is itself 
the greatest and chief Thanksgiving. 

2d. Christ blessed, not the Father, as the heretics choose to 
say, but the bread and wine, as S. Paul says expressly, the cup 
of blessing which we bless, Sic. (1 Cor. x.). Now Christ blessed 
the bread and the chalice, that is to say, He invoked the blessing 
and almighty power of God upon the bread and wine, that it 
might be then at that time, and in all future consecrations, 
converted, the bread into the Body, and the wine of the chalice 
into the Blood of Christ, whensoever the words of consecration

w 

Are rightly and duly (legitime) pronounced. Similar was the 
blessing of the loaves (Luke ix. 16). Not, therefore, was this 
benediction the same as consecration, though S. Thomas thinks 
otherwise (see Council of Trent, Sess. 13, cap. 1). Whence in the 
Liturgies of S. James and S. Basil, and in our Canon, we pray, 
after Christ’s example, that God would bless these gifts, that the 
Divine power may descend upon the bread and the chalice, to 
perfect the consecration. Hence it is called the chalice of 
benediction , i.e., blessed by Christ. Whence also S. Paul says 
(1 Cor. x. 16), “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not 
the communication of the Blood of Christ ? ” 

Lastly, it seems that Christ blessed the bread by making over 
it the sign of the cross, and in blessing, invoked the power of 
God, that it might become consecrated and transubstantiated. 
For, according to the practice of the Church, priests in consecra- 
tion bless the bread and the wine with the sign of the cross. 
This they do after the example of Christ 

This is My Body. From hence it is plain that the Eucharist 
is not the figure of the Body of Christ, as the Innovators per- 
versely say, but the true and proper Body of Christ, which was 
born of the Virgin Mary, and crucified on Calvary, as the Church 
has believed in all ages, and defined in many Councils. This 
I have shown on 1 Cor. xi. 24. There Paul, in the same words, 
repeats and relates the institution of the Eucharist. We must 
add, that some have been tom away from this faith, because they # 
are not able to comprehend how the Body of Christ, so lofty and 
so great, can be contained whole in (sub) a very little host. But 
these persons ought to remember that God is Almighty; and 
that as He constituted nature, so also He often works, as He 
wills, contrary to nature, in a supernatural manner, that He may 
show Himself to be the Lord and God of nature and of all 
things. Wherefore, whatsoever there is peculiar in nature may 
be inverted and altogether changed (everii). Consequently, God 
is able to effect that a great quantity may be contained in a little 

space, yea, in a point This is the theological reason. But in

order to give full satisfaction to some weak minds, I will sub- 
join two evidential arguments for this mystery to show that it is 
possible — arguments which derive their force from analogy. Take, 
therefore, the following demonstration, drawn from a physical 
analogy — from the eye and a mirror. For both a looking-glass 
and a small eye receive into themselves the whole quantity of 
the very greatest things, not only men, but houses, temples, 
trees, mountains, &c., and clearly reproduce and represent them 
whole. Why then should not a small host, by God’s power, set 
forth ( exhibeat ) whole Christ? You will say that in the eye and 
in the mirror what takes place is done in a spiritual manner, 
by means of optical or visual appearances. I reply, in like 
manner the Body of Christ in the Eucharist assumes a spiritual 
mode of existence, so that, as a spirit, it should be spiritually 
in the very small portion of the host.* Let us add this, that 
the objective appearances themselves are not spiritual in such 
a sense as that they are not really natural and physical, yes, 
corporeal, entities. For they are inseparable from corporeal 
entities, such as the atmosphere. And of these things we see 
that very many, and as it were an infinite number, are received 
and comprehended in a mirror and in the eye. If all this con- 
stantly takes place in a natural manner, with respect to the 
appearances received by the eye, much mere can the omnipotence 
of God do the same thing supematurally in respect to the Body 
of Christ, miraculously in the Eucharist 

(Here follows in the original what the Author calls an analogical 
mathematical demonstration. This is omitted, both because it 
would involve the printing of two intricate mathematical diagrams, 
as also because such a species of argument seems less likely to 
convince now than it did when d Lapide wrote.) 

You may add here a third proof drawn from condensation 
and rarefaction, which I have brought forward on i Cor. xi. 25. 
Water in a vessel, made dense by means of cold, occupies only 


• Lot, ut quasi spiritus spiritualitcr sit in puncto hostiae.

half of the vessel, but when it is made hot and rarefied by means 
of fire, it bubbles up and fills the whole vessel. And yet the 
water continues the same as regards matter, volume (molem) 9 
and, as many celebrated philosophers are of opinion, as regards 
intrinsic bulk; for nothing is added to the water by rarefaction 
except extension in space. If, then, this takes place according to 
natural laws, why should God be unable to do the same thing 
supematurally, as respects the body of Christ ? 

Luke adds (xxil 19), This is My Body which is given for you, 
Le., which is about to be given. S. Paul (1 Cor. xl) has, which 
shall be delivered (Vulg.) ; Gr. xk&ati o», broken . 

Luke also adds, This do ye for a commemoration of Me. By 
these words Christ gave to the Apostles, and to the Priests who 
were to be ordained by them, power, as well as commandments, 
to consecrate and transubstantiate bread into His Body, and wine 
into His Blood. Wherefore by these words Christ constituted and 
ordained His Apostles Priests and Bishops, as the Council of Trent 
teaches (Sess. 22, cap. 1). For by these words He commanded 
His Apostles, as Bishops, to ordain Priests to celebrate as well 
the Sacrament as the Sacrifice of the Eucharist, continuously 
and perpetually throughout all ages. And this He did both for 
the perpetual praise and worship of God, and also for the 
spiritual nourishment of the faithful, that they might, by this 
means, ask and obtain of God every grace for the Church. 
And this is the doctrine and faith of the whole Church. This 
do 9 therefore, is as though He said, “Do what I do, i.e., con- 
secrate, sacrifice, transubstantiate bread and wine, and eat them, as 
I have consecrated, sacrificed, transubstantiated, eaten the same. 
Moreover, also, ordain Priests and Bishops, who, by a perpetual 
succession, may do the same, even unto the end of the world.” 

For a commemoration of Me. “That, namely, by the con- 
secration and receiving of the Eucharist, ye may commemorate, 
and, as S. Paul says (1 Cor. xi. 26), may announce (Vulg.), My 
death.” For consecrating Priests are here bidden not only to 
remember the Death of Christ, but to recall the same to memory

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVL 


with Christian people, that they may be always mindful of so 
great a benefit, and of Christ’s great condescension and re- 
demption, and thankful for it, and so by it ask and obtain all 
grace from God. 

Ver. 27. And taking the chalice, , &c. Bellarmine (lib. iv. de 
Eucharist, c. 27) is of opinion that Christ did not consecrate 
the chalice immediately after the consecration of the bread, but 
that many actions and words of His intervened. He endeavours 
to prove this from the fact that S. Matthew says, whilst they were 
at supper ; but Luke and Paul say concerning the chalice, likewise 
also the cup after supper 

But it is far more probable that Christ, after the consecration 
of the bread, proceeded immediately with the consecration of the 
chalice. For Matthew, Mark, and Luke so relate. Moreover, 
the rationale of the Sacrament and the Eucharistic Sacrifice so 
required that there should not be any division or interruption, 
but that the whole matter should be accomplished at one and the 
same time. And we know that to the rationale of the Sacrifice 
pertains the consecration of the wine as well as the bread. For 
Christ instituted this Sacrifice after the manner of a feast, for 
which wine is required for drink, as well as bread for food. 
Thus likewise in the Old Testament, in the sacrifice of the 
mincha, that is, of fine flour, equally as in the sacrifice of animals, 
there was added a drink-offering , , i.e. 9 a pouring forth of wine and 
oil. For sacrifice is offered to God that it should be a refection 
of God. But for a refection, drink is required as well as food, 
that is to say, both wine and bread. 

Drink ye all of this. Christ said this before the consecration 
of the chalice. Wherefore, in Mark xiv. 23 there is an hystero- 
logia when it is said, and they all drank of it. And presently 
he relates that Christ consecrated it, saying, This is My Blood 
of the New Testament . But it is certain from Matthew and Luke 
that Christ first consecrated the chalice, and then gave it to His 
Apostles to drink. For otherwise they would have drunk mere 
wine, and not the Blood of Christ

COMMUNION IN ONE KIND. 


181 


Observe, that Christ divided the bread into thirteen parts, one 
of which He took first Himself, and then gave the remaining 
parts to the Apostles, one by one. But with the contents of 
the chalice, being liquid, He could not do this. Wherefore, after 
it was consecrated, Christ first drank of it Himself, and then gave 
it to his next neighbour, whether John or Peter, bidding him pass 
it to his nearest neighbour, and thus the chalice passed round 
the company, and all the Apostles drank of it Wherefore it 
does not follow, as the Hussites and Luther say, that the chalice 
ought to be given to the laity, and that they ought to communi- 
cate in both kinds, because Christ and the Apostles communicated 
in both kinds, and that the same is Christ’s command. For this 
precept of drinking, where He said, Drink ye all of this (as the 
Church has always understood), pertained only to the Apostles, 
who alone were then present For Christ at that time was 
consecrating them Priests, and He bade them consecrate the 
Sacrament and Sacrifice of the Eucharist under both kinds, and 
bade them receive both kinds, that they might complete a perfect 
Sacrifice. But He did not command this to the laity, to whom, 
inasmuch as they do not sacrifice, but only receive the Eucharist 
as a Sacrament, it is sufficient that they take it under one kind, 
because in one kind they receive the whole effect and fruit of 
the Sacrament And it is especially to be considered that in 
so great a number of lay people communicating, the chalice 
might easily be overturned, and the Blood of Christ contained 
in it spilt upon the ground, which would be an act of great 
irreverence. Similarly the command of Christ, This do ye for 
a commemoration of Afe, in what refers to consecration, pertains 
only to Priests; but to the laity pertains only the receiving of 
the consecrated Bread, as is plain. For when several precepts 
are mingled together, their variety may be limited and distributed, 
according to the condition of the persons intended, and the inten- 
tion of the legislator, who in this place is Christ, and His interpreter 
the Church.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


Dom.\ observes that formerly it was forbidden to the Hebrews to 
drink the blood of animals, as is plain from Heb. ix. 22, Lev. 
iv. 6, &c., but that now the Blood of Christ is drunk by His 
Priests. First, because the Blood of Christ is life-giving. 2nd. 
Because by It we have been redeemed. 3rd. Because by It, being 
made spiritual, we shudder at the sins of a carnal life, as at 
impure blood. 

For this is My Blood of the New Testament Syr. Covenant , &c. 
The Ethiopic has, This is My very Blood . He means, “in this 
chalice, by this My consecration, wine is turned into My Blood. 
Wherefore, after this consecration, there is no longer wine there, 
but My Blood, by which the new Covenant and Testament are 
confirmed and rectified, by means of My mediation between God 
and man.” For Christ by His Blood, shortly to be shed, merited 
and confirmed for us the hope and the right of eternal in- 
heritance in Heaven, which was the chief and the last will of 
Christ the Testator. And the Sacraments afford this right to us, 
especially the Eucharist, in the same way that a testament con- 
signs in writing to the heir a right to the testator’s goods. 

Observe: Matthew and Mark have, My Blood of the New 

Testament But Luke and Paul have, This chalice is the New 

Testament in My Blood . The meaning in both is the same, but 
Christ would seem to have actually uttered what Matthew and 
Mark relate. For this is an expression of clearer meaning. 
Christ, by instituting the Eucharist at His last supper, rather 

than upon the Cross, ratified His testament and covenant with 

the Church. For all the Apostles were here present. And they 
personified and represented the Church. 

Observe, secondly: In the form of consecrating the chalice 
which we now use in the Sacrifice of the Mass, there are added 
these words, The eternal testament the mystery of the faith . Tra- 
dition says they have been handed down from S. Peter, who is 
the author of our Liturgy. So teach Leo IX. (Epist. ad. Michael 
imp. c. 9) and S. Thomas (3 p. q. 78, art. 2, ad. 4). For although 
they do not concern the essence of the form (and yet S. Thomas

in 1 Cor. xi. seems to say they do), wherefore they are not found 
in the Liturgies of S. James, S. Basil, S. Chrysostom, and S. 
Clement, yet they pertain to its complete integrity. And this is 
the common opinion of the whole Latin Church, which, in the 
form of consecrating the chalice in the Mass, writes and pro- 
nounces these words as spoken by Christ, and enjoined by the 
Apostles, equally with the rest. 

Where observe: The mystery of the faith signifies — 1st That 
the Blood of Christ veiled beneath the species is a hidden 
(arcanam) thing, which can be recognised and believed by faith 
alone. 2nd. That the very Blood of Christ, as it was shed in 
His Passion, is the object of faith whereby we are justified. 
For we believe that we are justified and cleansed from our 
sins by the merits of the Passion and Death of Christ. 

For many , for all men, who are very many. 

Shall be shed (Vulg.). But the Greek of Matthew, Mark, 
and Luke has is shed , in the present, £&, is 

offered in this Sacrifice of the Eucharist under the species 

of wine, and which shall be presently shed upon the Cross in 
its own species and natural form of blood. For the blood of 
the victim was wont to be shed in the sacrifice itself, and so 
was a libation made to God. Whence the shedding itself is 
called a libation, a drink-offering. Wherefore this chalice of the 
Blood of Christ, as it was the drink-offering of the Sacrifice of 
Christ, w is poured into the mouth of Christ and His Apostles, 
and for this reason the reception of the species, both of bread 
and wine, pertains to the object and the perfection of the 

Sacrifice. 

Hence, then, it is plain that the Eucharist is not only a 

Sacrament, but a Sacrifice, in truth, the only Sacrifice of the 
New Law, which has succeeded to all the ancient sacrifices, and 
which contains them all in their completeness in Itself. There- 
fore Christ is called “a Priest after the order of Melchizedek,” 
not of Aaron. For Aaron offered sheep, but Melchizedek bread 
and wine, even as Christ did, and transubstantiated them into

His Body and Blood (see Ps. cx. 4 and Heb . v. 6, 7). The 
Eucharist is, therefore — 1st A burnt-offering; 2nd. A sin-offering. 
3rd. A peace-offering ; 4th. A mincha, or meat-offering (I^v. L, &C.). 

That this is so is plain — 1st. Because Christ did not say of 
His Blood, “ which is poured upon many? as a Sacrament, but 
“ which is shed for many? as a sacrifice and drink-offering. 

2nd. Because the Greek of all three Evangelists is ix^u^irw, 
which is shed , in the present tense, that is to say, now, in this 
Supper and consecration of the Eucharist. Therefore He speaks 
of the present Sacrifice of the Eucharist, and not only of that 
which was about to take place upon the Cross. And so S. 
Ambrose understands (in Ps. 38). But the Vulgate translates, 
shall be shed , because it has respect to the Sacrifice of the 
Cross, which was just about to take place, in which the Blood 
of Christ was most evidently and most perfectly shed for the 
salvation of sinners, of which this sacramental shedding of His 
Blood in the Eucharist was a type and figure, and therefore was, 
typically, one and the same with It. 

3rd. Because Luke and Paul, to the words of consecration, 
This is My Body , add, which is given, that is, is offered, for you 
in sacrifice. Paul has, which is broken for you, that is to say, 
under the species of bread in the Eucharist, and actually by the 
nails and lance upon the Cross. Wherefore Paul calls the 
Eucharist, the bread which we break, viz., in the Sacrament, 
because we break and eat the species of bread, as offering this 
in sacrifice to God, by receiving and consuming them, none of 
which things were done upon the cross. Therefore to break 
bread signifies, the Sacrifice, not of the Cross, but of the 
Eucharist. 

4th. Because Luke has expressly, roZro rb Tbrrjmt 4 xcc/n) 
djaOjxri ip rfi cduarf fio\i, rb farif u/aUp ix^o/Aircr, Le., this cup is 
the New Testament in My Blood, which, i.e,, the cup, shall be 
poured forth for you . For the word which must be referred to 
the cup, not to the Blood ; since al/man is in the dative case, 
ei in the nom. Therefore the chalice of the Blood of Christ

INFINITE VALUE OF THE VICTIM. 


I8 5 


is poured out for us; but it is poured out in the Eucharist, 
not on the Cross, for then there was no chalice. Therefore the 
pouring out of the Blood is a drink-offering and a sacrifice. 

The Sacrifice of the Eucharist, then, is a whole burnt-offering, 
because in consecrating and eating we offer whole Christ to 
God. The same is a peace-offering, because by It we ask and 
obtain peace, that is, all good things from God The same also 
is a sin-offering, because it is offered to God, and obtains from 
Him remission of venial sins and temporal punishments. But It 
obtains remission of mortal sins indirectly, because It obtains 
from God prevenient grace and contrition, by which they are 
blotted out (See Council of Trent % Scss. 22. q. 2. See also S. 
Thomas and the Scholastics on the Eucharistic Sacrifice.) 

I«astly, to the Blood of Christ rather than to His Body is 
ascribed remission of sins, although it pertains to both. The 
reason is, that in the Old Testament expiation is attributed to 
blood, and in the sin-offering the victim’s blood was poured 
out. Also by the shedding of His Blood the Death of Christ 
is signified, which was the all- worthy price, expiation and satis- 
faction for our sins. 

The first reason, then, which moved Christ to institute the 
Eucharist, was to ordain a most excellent and Divine Sacrament 
in the New Law, by means of which He might feed the faithful 
with Divine Food. And that the Church might worthily, by It, 
as well unceasingly honour and worship God. For the victim 
which is offered to God in the Eucharistic Sacrifice is of infinite 
value. It is commensurate and co-equal with God Himself. For 
the victim is Christ Himself, who is both God and man. God 
Himself therefore is offered to God. Wherefore, since all our 
other worship, inasmuch as it is but that of creatures, is poor 
and worthless, therefore Christ made Himself to be the Victim 
in the Eucharist, that by It, as being God’s equal, we might 
render due and equal worship to God, even such as He of right 
requires. Moreover, this Sacrifice chiefly consists in the con- 
secration. For by it Christ is mystically slain, when His Body

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


and His Blood are severally apportioned ( seorsim allocantur) under 
the species of bread and wine, as Suarez and Lessius (lib. 12, 
de Perfect Div. c. 13, n. 94) teach from SS. Gregory, Irenseus, 
Nyssen, &c. By the word “severally” (seorsim), “ by themselves,” 
understand only as regards the effect (vis) of consecration. For 
by concomitance, where there is the Body of Christ, there also 
is His Blood, and vice versd. 

The second reason was, that He might leave unto us a perpetual 
exhibition (ideam) of His Life and Passion, to continually stir up 
in every one the memory of so great a redemption. For in the 
Eucharist the Blood is consecrated by Itself, and the Body of 
Christ is consecrated by Itself, that His Passion may thereby be 
set forth, in which His Blood was shed, and separated from His 
Body. The species therefore of wine shows forth (represents) 
the Blood of Christ shed. The species of bread exhibits the 
lifeless Body of Christ. This is what He said, Do this , &c. 
And S. Paul, 1 Cor. xi. 26, says, As oft as ye shall eat, &c, ye 
shall announce the Lords Death until He come . 

The third reason was, the greatness of the love of Christ 
towards His faithful people, by which, as He united our flesh, 
hypostatically, in the Incarnation, to His Deity, so in the 
Eucharist, sacramentally, He unites the same together with His 
Godhead, to each faithful communicant, and as it were incor- 
porates them, that each may become Divine, and in a certain 
sense a Christ and God. For this is what S. John says of 
Christ when He was about to institute the Eucharist, before He 
washed the Disciples 1 feet John xiii. 1 : Jesus, knowing that 
His hour was come, and that He was about to pass out of this 
world to the Father, having loved His own that were in the 
world. He loved them to the end. 

To the end, to the extremity both of life and love. That is, 
He loved them with extremest and highest love, when He left 
Himself to them in the Eucharist, that they might always have 
Him present with them, that they might associate and converse 
with Him, consult Him, open to Him all their difficulties,

FRUITS OF THE EUCHARIST.

troubles, and temptations, ask and obtain His assistance. For 
as He Himself says in Prov. (viii. 31), “My delights are with 
the sons of men.” 

Hence, as the Church sings, with S. Thomas : 

** Himself as born for brotherhood, 

Feasting He gives His brethren food s 
Their price He gives Himself to die, 

Their guerdon when they reign on high.* 

That by this extremity of love He may entice, yea, compel 
us, ardently to love Him back. For a “magnet is the love of 
love.” It was this love which, as a sharp goad, drove S. 
Laurence to the flames, S. Vincent to the “wooden horse,” S. 
Sebastian to the arrows, S. Ignatius to the lions, and all the 
other martyrs bravely to endure and overcome all manner of 
pains and torments, that they might pay back love for love, 
life for life death for Christ’s death. This was why they were 
ambitious of martyrdom, and rejoiced and triumphed in it And 
these things were the effect of the Eucharist This supplied 
them with strength and gladness in all temptations and sufferings. 
Wherefore, of old time, the Christians in days of persecution 
used to communicate daily, that they might strengthen them- 
selves for martyrdom. Indeed, they took the Eucharist home 
with them, and received It with their own hands (as Mary 
Stuart, Queen of Scotland, when she was kept captive in Eng- 
land, and had no Priest with her). Christ before His Passion 
instituted the Eucharist, that by means of It He might arm the 
Apostles to meet temptation. 

A fourth reason was, that in the Eucharist Christ might give us 
the opportunity of exercising every virtue. For in it our faith is 
exercised, when we believe that He who is true God and man is 
invisibly, but really and truly, contained in a small host Hope is 
exercised, because when we believe that Christ giveth Himself 
unto us, we hope that He will give us all other things, which are 
far less than Himself Charity is exercised, because the Eucharist 
is a furnace of love, which Christ exhales, and breathes upon us,

1 88 


S. MATTHEW, C. XXVL 


that we may love Him again. Religion is exercised, because we 
worship and invoke God with the highest form of worship, and 
sacrifice to Him Christ Himself. Humility is exercised, because 
we ignore our eyes and senses and natural judgment, which suggests 
to us that there is only bread and wine in the Eucharist, and 
humbly submit ourselves to the words of Christ, who says, This is 
My Body : This is My Blood ' Gratitude is exercised, because by 

it we render highest thanks to God for all His benefits, which is 
why it is called Eucharist Abstinence is exercised, because it is 
not right to communicate otherwise than fasting. Patience and 
mortification are exercised, because it is a lively mirror of Christ's 
sufferings and crucifixion, and so on. 

The tropological reason is, that by feeding us with pis Divine 
Flesh, He may call us away from earthly flesh, and its pleasures 
and concupiscences, that we may live a life that is not carnal, but 
spiritual and divine, and may say with S. Paul, “ I live, yet not I, 
but Christ liveth in me.” A Christian ought therefore so to live, 
speak, work, as though it were not he himself, but Christ who is 
living, speaking, working in him. Let him live, therefore, like an 
angel, “ For man did eat angels’ food.” And S. Cyril of Jerusalem 
says ( Cateches . 4, Myst), “In the Eucharist we are made con- 
corporate, and of the same blood with Christ” 

Moreover, S. Chrysostom says (Hon 1. 36, in 1 Cor.), “Where 
Christ is eucharistically, there is not wanting the frequent presence 
of angels. Where there is such a King and such a Prince, there is 
the celestial palace, yea, there is Heaven itself.” Wherefore we 
read concerning S. Ammon in the Lives of the Fathers , that when 
he was celebrating, an angel was seen to stand at the altar, sign the 
communicants with the sign of the cross, and write their names 
in a book. And S. Chrysostom (lib. 3, de Sacerdotio) relates that 
choirs of angels have been seen round about the altar, who, with 
bowed heads, showed deepest reverence to Christ their King, and 
uttered awe-inspiring voices. When, therefore, we communicate, 
or say or hear Mass, let us think that we are sitting by the side of 
Christ at the Last Supper. Let us think that Christ is speaking by

THE FOOD OF IMMORTALITY.

the mouth of the Priest, is celebrating, is transubstantiating bread 
and wine into His Body and Blood, and is feeding us therewith. 
For it is Christ who is the chief Agent, and works the Eucharistic 
miracle, as the Council of Trent teaches ( Scss . 22). Wherefore 
S. Ambrose (lib. 8, in Luc.) says, “ It is this Body of which it is 
said, My Flesh is meat indeed. About this Body are the true 
eagles, which fly round about It with spiritual wings.” And (lib. 4 
de Sac!) “well may the eagles be about the altar where the Body 
is.” Wherefore S. Francis says, in his epistle to Priests, “It 
is a great misery, and a miserable infirmity, when you have Him 
Himself present, and care for anything else in the world.” 

The anagogical reason is, that Christ, in the Eucharist, gave us 
a pledge, a prelibation and a foretaste of the celestial inheritance. 
Wherefore the Church sings, with S. Thomas, in the Office of the 
Adorable Sacrament, “ O sacred Feast, in which Christ is received, 
in which the memory of His Passion is recalled, the soul is filled 
with grace, and to us is given a pledge of future glory.” 

S. Thomas says, “In the Eucharist spiritual sweetness is tasted 
at the very fountain.” This was what S. Francis, S. Monica, S. 
Catherine of Sienna, and many others were wont to feel at the 
Holy Eucharist, who were inebriated with heavenly delights, and 
kept jubilee, exulted, and were rapt in ecstasy, saying with the 
Psalmist, “ My heart and my flesh exult in the living God. For 
whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and who is there upon earth 
that I desire in comparison of Thee ? God is the strength of my 
heart, and my portion for ever.” 

M My Jesus, my Love, my God, and my all.” 

Again, the Eucharist is the Food of immortality, because by 
virtue of It our bodies rise to the life immortal, according to that 
saying of Christ (John vi.), “Whoso eateth of this Bread shall live 
for ever.” The Eucharist therefore stamps upon our bodies a 
certain force, not physical, but moral, which is the seed of im- 
mortality, that by means of it we may rise again. Whence S. 
Chrysostom rightly concludes (Horn. 83, in Maith .), “ How, then,

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


does it not behove that he should be purer who enjoys such a 
sacrifice ? Should not the hand which divides this Flesh be more 
resplendent than a solar ray? Should not the mouth be filled with 
spiritual fire ; and the tongue, which is ruddy, with that tremendous 
Blood?” 

And our Thomas, taught of God, says in the 4 th Book of the 
Imitation , , chap, . 2, “It ought to seem as great, as new, and as 
pleasant to thee, when thou celebratest or hearest Mass, as though 
Christ on that self-same day descended into the Virgin’s womb, 
and became man; or was hanging upon the Cross, suffering and 
dying for man’s salvation,” Whence he gathers (chap, v.), “that 
when a Priest celebrates devoutly, he honours God, makes glad the 
angels, builds up the Church, assists the living, affords rest to the 
departed, and makes himself to have a share in all these good 
things.” “For what is His goodness, and what is His beauty, 
unless it be the wheat of the elect, and the wine that bringeth 
forth virgins?” ( Zech, ix. 17) Vulgate. 

Ver. 29. I say unto you . . . fruit of the vine; Arab., juice of the 
vine, &c. S. Austin (lib, de Consens, Evang, iiL 1), and from him 
Jansen and others, are of opinion that Matthew intimates that 
Christ spake these words after the Eucharistic Supper. Let us 
here consider the following objection. “ The fruit of the vine is 
wine produced from it, pressed from its grapes; therefore in the 
Eucharistic Chalice there is not the Blood of Christ, but only wine 
sprung from a vine.” I answer, the pronoun this in this fruit ; &c., 
does not signify exactly that wine which was in the consecrated 
Chalice, but in general the wine upon the table, from which the 
cup was filled, which was used both at the Passover and at the 
consecration of the Eucharist. Secondly, the Blood of Christ may 
be called wine, as the Body of Christ is called bread by S. Paul, on 
account, indeed, of the substance of bread and wine, as it was 
before consecration, and because of the species of bread and wine 
which remain after consecration. In truth, the species themselves, 
or the accidents of the wine, are rightly called the fruit of the vine 9 
because they are produced by the vine. Thirdly, as all kinds of

food, both by Scriptural and common usage, are often called bread) 
because it is the staple of all food, so in like manner is any kind of 
drink called wine, especially by the Italians, Syrians, and others. 

But it is far more probable that Christ spake these words before 
the institution of the Eucharist, .concerning the supper and the 
chalice of the paschal lamb. For at that supper a cup of wine 
was carried round, which the father of the family tasted first, and 
then sent round about to all who partook of the lamb, as the 
Jewish tradition is. This second view is proved, because Luke 
expressly asserts as much. He distinctly gives an account of the 
two suppers of Christ, — that upon the lamb, and the Eucharistic 
Supper, — which Matthew, for the sake of brevity, condensed into 
one. And he says that these words concerning the chalice were 
spoken before the Eucharist at the paschal supper. We may see 
that the same conclusion must be drawn from what Christ said 
previously concerning the eating of the lamb {Luke xxii. 15, 16). 
“And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this 
Passover with you before I suffer : for I say unto you, I will not 
any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 
Then immediately afterwards He subjoins what is said concerning 
the cup of the paschal lamb, “And he took the cup, and gave 
thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: for 
I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the 
kingdom of God shall come.” Then, immediately afterwards, he 
relates the institution of the Eucharist, and of the Eucharistic cup, 
which Christ consecrated, saying, “Likewise also the cup after 
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in ray blood, which 
is shed for you.” Where there is no mention made of the fruit of 
the vine, , nor of drinking new wine in the kingdom of God. 

Christ intended, therefore, by these words only to signify that 
He, from henceforth, would not sup with His disciples after the 
accustomed manner ; but that this was His last supper, after which 
He was about to be taken and put to death. Wherefore here, as 
proceeding to die, He bids the Apostles His last farewell. Where- 
fore these words do not refer to the Eucharistic Chalice, which

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVl. 


!92 

does not contain the fruit of the vine , in the sense of wine, but the 
Blood of Christ, into which it has been changed by consecration. 
This is the opinion of Jerome, Bede, and many others. 

When 1 will drink it neiu with you , &c New, i.e., of a new 
and different kind For in Heaven the Blessed drink no earthly 
wine, but heavenly, even the wine and nectar of everlasting glory 
and joy; according to the words of Psalm xxxvi. 9, “They shall 
be inebriated with the fatness of Thy house: Thou shalt give 
them to drink of the torrent of Thy pleasure.” So Origen on this 
passage, and Nazianzen ( Or at de Paschal). For Scripture is wont 
to express the spiritual joys of the Blessed by means of corporeal 
pleasures, such as food and drink. 

You will say that Christ after His Resurrection, in order to 
prove it to His Apostles, ate with them, and, as it would appear, 
also drank wine with them. How, then, does He here say that 
He will no more drink wine with them ? I answer, that Christ did 
indeed both eat and drink with His Apostles after the Resur- 
rection, but only by the way as it were, and to prove to them that 
He had risen, but not to satisfy the requirements of nature, as He 
had done before His death. Wherefore, speaking after the manner 
of men, that reception of food after the Resurrection cannot be 
counted eating. 

And when they had sung an hymn , &c. Vulg. said an hymn , but 
meaning sung. Greek i.e., said or sung a hymn , by 

way of giving thanks and praise to God. The Arabic has, they gave 
praise . Some think from the books of the Hebrew ritual that this 
was the hymn customarily sung by the Jews at the Passover, to 
give thanks after eating the lamb. But indeed, as Paul Burgensis 
observes, and from him Franc. Lucas, Baronius, and others, this 
hymn consisted of seven psalms of Hallelujah, beginning with the 
113th, “ When Israel came out of Egypt, n and ending with the 
119th, “ Blessed are the undefiled in the way .” From hence S. 
Chrysostom concludes that no one ought to depart from Mass 
before the thanksgivings, which are contained in the collects after 
communion. You may gather the same principle from an ordinary

dinner or supper, from which people ought not to depart before 
returning thanks to God. Hence, also, the Fourth Council of 
Toledo asserts that this hymn of Christ’s affords us an example 
of singing hymns. Hence, also, the practice of singing at Mass is 
of the highest antiquity, as is plain from the ancient Liturgies. 

This, then, was the custom of the ancient Hebrews, to sing 
hymns at the Paschal Supper, which the Christians afterwards 
followed, in that after the Eucharist and the Agape, a common 
feast of charity for all the faithful, they sung hymns and psalms 
by way of giving thanks to God. This is gathered from S. Paul 
(Eph. v. 19), and Tertullian eloquently shows the same (ApoL 
c. 39), and S. Cyprian ( Epist. ad Donat). 

The ancient heathen had a similar practice at their feasts, in 
honour of their gods. 

Lastly, S. Augustine (Epist 253) says that this hymn of Christ 
was in circulation in his time, but he himself regarded it as 
spurious, and intimates that it was forged by the Priscillianists. 

They went out to the Mount of Olives. Christ was wont, 
especially in these last days of His life, to go daily to Jerusalem, 
and teach in the Temple; and then about evening to return to 
Bethany, and there sup, and soon after supper return to the Mount 
of Olives, and there spend the night in prayer, as Luke intimates 
(xxi. 37). But upon this occasion He did not go to Bethany, as 
He had supped in Jerusalem. He went, therefore, direct to the 
Mount of Olives, as it were to a wrestling-ground, that there He 
might offer Himself to be seized by Judas and the Jews. Thus 
Victor of Antioch asks, “Why did He go out to the mountain? 
why does He despise a lurking-place, and manifest Himself to 
those who came to apprehend Him? He made haste to occupy 
the spot where aforetime He was wont to pray, the spot which His 
betrayer knew so well ” (John xviiL 2). 

Ver. 31. Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended 
because of Me this night ; for it is written , 1 will smite the Shepherd \ 
and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. Be offended and fall 

into sin, first the sin of weakness and cowardice in forsaking Me,

your Master and Lord, in My Passion. “The terror of the 
disciples,” says S. Leo, “was then excusable, nor did their sorrow 
sink into distrust” And further on, speaking of S. Peter’s denial, 
“ The Lord saw not in thee a feigned faith, nor estranged love, but 
shaken resolution.” It was thus that Marcellinus and many others, 
when asked whether they were Christians, and denied it through 
fear of tortures, sinned not directly against the faith, but merely 
against its open profession, in not daring openly to confess it 

But the Apostles seem to have stumbled in the faith, because^ 
when they saw Christ seized by the Jews without defending Him- 
self, they thought He was suffering either unwillingly or by com- 
pulsion, and as He could not deliver Himself and them, He 
consequently was not God, and that as He would die and never 
rise again, they had nothing further to hope for from Him. They 
consequently forgot and disbelieved all His promises and predic- 
tions. The Church accordingly seems to think that the Blessed 
Virgin alone remained then steadfast in the faith. For in the 
Office for Good Friday the Church puts out all the lights one by 
one, leaving only one burning; though others confine this more 
strictly to faith in the resurrection, as if she alone believed that 
He would rise again from the dead. This is clear, too, from 
the Apostles, who hardly believed Christ when He appeared to 

t 

them after His resurrection, and said that He was alive. Christ 
accordingly reproved their unbelief (Mark xvi. 14). And so S. 
Hilary explains it, “Ye shall be troubled with fear and want of 
faith.” And Euthymius, “The faith ye now have in Me will be 
driven out of you, because ye will believe that I can no longer 
help you.” Indeed our Lord foretold this. See John xvi. 31, 32, 
“The hour cometh when ye shall be scattered, every one to his 
own, and shall leave Me alone. Ye believe in Me now, but very 
soon ye will not believe, when ye see Me a captive and suffer- 
ing.” For not only “did they forsake Him hastily, but” (says S. 
Augustine, Tract, ciil) “ in their hearts forsook the faith. For they 
were reduced to as great despair, and extinction (as it were) of 
their faith, as appeared in Cleopas when he said he trusted that

He would have redeemed Israel But see how they forsook Him, 
in abandoning the very faith wherewith they believed in Him.” 
Many commentators follow S. Augustine in considering that the 
Apostles fell away from the faith. And S. Ambrose also main- 
tains that S. Peter lost his faith, and Turrecremata also (de Eccl. 
L 30 and iii. 61). But many theologians teach at the present day 
that he did not lose his faith, but merely sinned in not openly 
professing it This, they urge, is all that the Evangelists say ; why 
invent a heavier charge, and urge it against him? S. Augustine 
says (in John % Tract, cxiii.) he merely denied that he was a Christian, 
as people did in Japan, though still retaining the faith in their 
hearts. S. Cyril (Jib. xL 41, in John) maintains that he denied 
Christ not through fear, but through love ; for that if he confessed 
himself His disciple he could not have remained by Him, as he 
wished to do. S. Ambrose (in Luc. xxii.) says that he did not 
deny God, but man. “ I know not the man, because I know Him 
to be God.” And when he says (Scrm. xlvil) that Peter gave up 
the faith, he means the profession of the faith. So, too, S. Hilary 
(cap. xxxii. in Matt) and S. Leo (as above), “ His tears abounded 
where his love failed not, and the fount of charity washed away 
the words of fear.” Peter then sinned mortally against the profes- 
sion of the faith, and consequently lost charity, though not faith. 
Maldonatus, Toletus (in John xviii.), Bellarmine (de Eccl. iii. 17) 
distinctly maintain this; Suarez (de Ftde Disp.ix, sect. 6) thinks it 
was probably the case with all the Apostles that they fled through 
fear, and not as denying Christ 

God allowed this for various reasons. 1. To suggest to Christ 
further grounds for patience, and to exercise Him in every kind of 
suffering. For the defection of the Apostles was a great affliction 
to Christ ; not merely on their own account, but because He saw 
that ail the fruit of His preaching had been lost upon them. 
2. To humble the Apostles with a sense of their own weakness, 
when they saw that all their courage and resolution had melted 
away. “ Like lions before the battle, like deer when in it” 3. To 
•how the power of persecution and fear which bereft them of their

faith, their memory, and senses; and that consequently this fear 
could not be overcome by their natural reason or strength, but 
only by Divine grace, which they should constantly implore. “ We 
learn thence,” says S. Chrysostom, “a great lesson, that the will 
of man is powerless unless strengthened by help from above." 
And S. Victor of Antioch, “ Man’s promptitude is worthless for 
withstanding graver temptations, if heavenly aid be wanting." 

I will smite . The Heb. and Sept read “ smite ” in the im- 
perative. The meaning is, however, the same. The Prophets 
frequently use the imperative for the future by way of apostrophe. 
“Smite, O sword,” that is, “I God will smite Christ, will suffer 
Him,” i.e., to be smitten. Comp. Isa. vl 10 with S. Paul, Acts 
xxviil 26. 

The shepherd. Christ the Shepherd and the Bishop of our souls 
(1 Pet ii. 25). 

And the sheep shall be scattered, \ i.e., the Apostles. But God 
soon brought them together again, that Christ might find them 
joined in one body, and restore them their faith and courage. For 
having no homes of their own, they naturally betook themselves 
to the upper chamber, where they had kept the Passover, that He 
the master of that house might be again their host and friend, and 
where, in fact, He soon after appeared to them, and restored their 
faith. This was Christ’s special favour. He bestowed it on Peter 
after his threefold denial, when by a look He made him weep 
bitterly ; and on S. John, whom He brought back and placed by 
His mother near the cross, and commended him to His mother as 
her son. There can then be no question that they both returned 
into favour with Christ and were sanctified. Christ foretold this 
to show that He was God, and that He suffered for man’s redemp- 
tion, not compulsorily, but willingly; and that when suffering thus 
“they might not despair,” says S. Hilary, “but might exercise 
repentance and be saved.” 

Ver. 32. But after 1 am risen again , I will go before you into 
Galilee, “where I will meet you,” says Euthymius. “He men- 
tioned Galilee,” says S. Chrysostom, “to deliver them from fear

of the Jews, and induce them the more readily to listen to Him.” 
It was to keep them from despair. 

Ver. 33. Peter answered and said unto Him , Though all should he 
offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended. This was from 
his vehement love for Christ. “For faith is the ardent affection 
towards God,” says S. Jerome, “which makes him speak thus.” 
“ For he thinks ” (says S. Augustine, de Grot, de lib . Arb. cap . xvii.) 
“ that he can really do that which he feels he wishes.” And yet 
his sin was threefold — first, in boldly and vehemently contradicting 
Christ ; next, in arrogantly preferring himself to others ; thirdly, in 
too great presumption and reliance on his own strength. He ought 
to have said, “ I believe it can be, nay, that from my weakness it will 
be so. But do Thou, O Lord, strengthen my weakness by Thy 
grace ; support and sustain me, that 1 fall not into sin.” And our 
experience is the same. We think that we are strong in faith, in 
chastity, in patience; but when tribulation assails us we stumble, 
we are afraid, and speedily fall. The remedy for temptation is 
the acknowledgment of our own weakness and the imploring Divine 
strength. 

Ver. 34. Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this 
night y before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me thrice. In Greek 
arap>T) 6 fi, abjure Me. Thou wilt do much worse than the others. 
Thy presumption deserves it. They only fled, thou shalt abjure 
Me. — The cock crows more loudly in the morning than at midnight 
This time, then, is properly the cock-crowing. It was before this 
cock-crowing that Peter thrice denied Christ As S. Mark says, 
“ Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny Me thrice.” Thou 
who art now so eager to confess Me, wilt be more frequent and 
eager in thy denials this very night than the cock in his crowing. 
And yet the cock awakes the sleepers to praise God, whilst thou, 
by thy denial, wilt excite others to revile Me. 

Peter, says S. Jerome, made professions from the warmth of his 
faith, and the Saviour foretold, as God, what would be. And He 
gives the cock-crowing as a sign to Peter, in order that whenever 
he hears it he may remember Christ’s prophecy, may penitently

acknowledge his sin of denial and presumption, and seek for 
pardon; as indeed he did. “As God” (so Bede observes), “He 
foretells the mode, time, moment, and extent of his denial” 

Ver. 35. Peter saith unto Him, Though I should die with Thee % 
yet will I not deny Thee. Likewise also said they all. To testify 
their faith, affection, and love towards Him; but in their pre- 
sumption they sinned in a twofold manner. Thou wilt say, The 
Apostles believed Christ to be the Son of God, why then did they 
not believe (nay, clamoured against) Him when He predicted their 
fall? Why, because they did not attend to Christ’s prediction, 
but looked rather to their then purpose of heart, which they felt 
to be so strong that it would be impossible for them to fall away. 
And consequently regarding Christ’s words not so much a predic- 
tion as a test and trial of their purpose and love, they thought that 
in this time of trial their affection towards Him should be boldly 
and resolutely manifested. “ Peter,” says S. Hilary, “ was so car- 
ried forward by his affection and love for Christ, as to take no 
account of his own natural weakness, nor the belief he should have 
in the Lord’s words.” But even though they believed Christ’s 
prediction, yet they were free to deny Him, because neither did 
the prediction itself nor their belief in it take away their liberty, 
but rather presupposed it For Christ predicted their defection 
because they would certainly forsake Him; but they did not 
forsake Him because He foretold they would do so. Objectively 
their future defection was prior to Christ’s foreknowledge and 
prediction, for Christ only foresaw that which they would do 
as free agents, and accordingly imposed not on them any neces- 
sity of denying Him, since His prediction was objectively subse- 
quent. 

But thou wilt maintain, If Peter, believing Christ’s words, had 
persuaded himself that he would certainly deny Christ that very 
night, he could not have but done it ; because this persuasion and 
belief would have determined his mind, and bound him to do so. 
For no one can effectually strive against that which he knows will 
certainly happen by his own agency. The attempt would be vain.

He regards and shrinks from it as impossible ; for he knows that 
this and nothing else would happen, whatever his efforts. But, 
I reply, this persuasion would have inclined and in some measure 
have determined Peter to deny Christ, but yet only in a general 
way, that he would deny Him some time in the night, but not at 
that particular moment or occasion, or before such and such people. 
All his particular acts then would have been free. And in like 
manner that knowledge, that we cannot avoid all venial sins, obliges 
us Jo fall into them at some time or another. But yet only gene- 
rally, and in a confused way. For as often as we commit this or 
that venial sin, we sin of free choice. Theologians, and Suarez in 
his treatise on Hope, teach us that if a man’s damnation were 
revealed to him, he could not possibly effectually hope for eternal 
life, as already apprehending it to be impossible (for no one can 
attempt what he thinks impossible). But yet he both ought and 
can observe God’s commands, and that as often as he transgresses 
he would do so freely and sinfully, even though he is generally aware 
that he would fall into, and die in, some mortal sin. This fall of 
Peter and the rest made them more humble and cautious. See 
John xxi. 15, 21, 22. 

Ver. 36. Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethr 
semaney &c. Gethsemane is the valley of oil or fatness, or more 
precisely, the oil-press, for pressing the oil from the olives which 
grew on Mount Olivet It was somewhat more than half an 
(Italian) mile from the ccenaculum (upper chamber). Christ with- 
drew there — (1) for retirement and prayer, and to be free from 
distraction; (2) to show that He did not fly from death, but 
rather sought for it, for the place was well known to the traitor; 
and (3) to show that He suffered out of pure love and compassion 
for men. For oil is the type of compassion ; and as oil was in that 
spot pressed from the olives, so in His agony was the Blood of 
Christ pressed forth, with which we are refreshed as with oil, are 
anointed and are fed. See Cant. i. 3.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


Adrichomius describes the hut of S. Pelagia the penitent and the 
tomb of the Blessed Virgin as close by, and above it Mount 
Olivet, the place of the ascension; humility and exaltation being 
fitly associated together, as is oft the case with God’s elect To 
speak accurately, Christ neither prayed nor suffered His agony in 
Gethsemane, but in the garden close by; and He began His 
Passion in a garden as expiating the sin of Adam, which was 
committed in a garden. For he ruined therein himself and all 
his descendants, and subjected them to sin, death, and hell. And 
all these did Christ expiate in a garden by the agony He there 
endured. As in the Canticle, “ I raised thee up under the apple 
tree : there was thy mother defiled : there was she violated that 
bare thee ” (Cant viii 5). Christ therefore in the garden restored 
us to Paradise, from which we had been expelled by Adam, and 
planted there the garden of His Church, verdant with the anguish 
of mortification, the saffron of charity, the spikenard of humility, 
the lilies of virgins, the roses of martyrs, the chaplets of doctors ; 
for “a garden enclosed is my sister, a garden enclosed, a fountain 
sealed. Thy sendings forth (shoots) are of Paradise” (Cant iv. 
12, 13)- 

Ver. 37. And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, 
&c. He took only these three to be witnesses of His sorrow and 
agony, lest the other Apostles should be troubled and scandalised 
thereby. Moreover, Christ most relied on these three as His 
special intimates, and also because it was but fitting that they who 
had seen the glory of His transfiguration should contemplate His 
agony, and learn that the way to glory is through agony and 
suffering, and that the way of Calvary and the Cross leads to the 
Mount and glory of Tabor. 

And began to be sorrowful and very heavy . Of His own free 
will, and not by compulsion. He began to be so sore distressed 
as to be almost lifeless and beside Himself. “My soul is ex- 
ceeding sorrowful,” He says, “even unto death.” S. Luke calls it 
“an agony,” like those who are at the last struggle with death. 
Vulg. in Mark reads “ foedet for sorrow makes a man weary of

SUPERNATURAL SORROW OF CHRIST.

life. S. Mark adds, to be stupefied (\x 0 afi,/ 3 tte$ai ) 9 for excessive fear 
has this effect, as a lion stupefies other animals with its roar. Note, 
first, that Christ had true sorrow. For though from the moment 
of His conception He enjoyed the vision of God, as hypostati- 
cally united to Him, and thus enjoyed the highest happiness, He 
was yet supremely sorrowful, God supematurally enlarging the 
capacity of His soul, that it might experience the highest joy and 
the deepest sorrow at the same time. This is the general opinion 
of theologians, though Melchior Canus (de Locis xii. 14) says that 
the joy naturally arising from the sight of God was suspended 
while He was but a sojourner, in order that He might feel sorrow. 
(See S, Thomas , /. iii. q. 46, art. 8, and Suarez, p. in, g. 18, 
Disp. 38, sect. 8.) Christ was both on His journey and had reached 
the end (viator et comprehensor). In the one character He was 

full of sorrow, in the other full of joy. But even when on the way 

He had both the greatest joy and the greatest sorrow in His 

Passion. He was sorrowful in His lower nature, since it was 

painful ; He rejoiced in His higher nature, since it was the will of 
God, and ordained for man’s salvation. 

2. This sorrow was not only in His feelings, but also in His 
will (at least in its lower part), which naturally regards that which 
is for itself good as life and death, and hates the contrary. This 
is clear from His own prayer, “ Father, not what I will, but what 
Thou wilt” He naturally wished to be saved from death. As in 
Luke, “ Not my will, but Thine be done.” 

3. The primary cause of His sorrow was npt the flight of His 
Apostles, which He foresaw, but the vivid apprehension of His 
approaching Passion and death, as is plain from His prayer, “ Let 
this cup pass from Me.” For Christ foresaw all the torments, one 
by one, which the Jews would inflict on Him, and fully entered 
into and weighed the magnitude and bitterness of His several 
sorrows, so as to seem to be already suffering them, even to the 
shedding of His blood. For Christ doubtless wished to atone 
by His sorrow for the pleasure which Adam had in eating the 
forbidden fruit, and which sinners now experience in their sins.

S. MATTHEW, c. XXVI. 


There were, moreover, other grounds of sorrow, which He 
experienced in the highest degree from the very moment of His 
conception to His death. First, the sins of all men, which He 
undertook to atone for, and thus make satisfaction for the injury 
done to His Father. For the soul of Christ saw them all in God, 
and manifested for them the greatest sorrow and compunction, 
as though they had been His own. For He saw how great was 
their gravity, how the majesty of God was offended, and con- 
sequently what wrong had been done to Him. All which elicited 
condign and commensurate sorrow. So He says Ps. xxii. i. 

2. The second was His foreseeing all the pains which martyrs, 
confessors, virgins, married people also would suffer in their 
several ways. Prelates too and pastors in governing the faithful; 
the faithful in withstanding the temptations of the world, the 
flesh, and the devil All which sorrows Christ generally and 
severally mentally took upon Him, that by His sorrow He might 
obtain for them from God the Father grace and strength to bear 
and overcome them alL For He loves His children as Himself 
and feels for their affliction. See Matt xxv. 35, 40. 

3. The third was the ingratitude of men. For He foresaw 
that His Passion would be of use to but very few, and that the 
many would be lost through their own negligence and ingratitude. 
As the poet sings, — 

“ 'Tis not my grief, ’tis love ; my only pain 
Is that to thousands ’twill be all in vain.” 

4. The fourth was the affliction of His mother; for the 
sorrows of the Son pierced, as a sword, the soul of the mother, 
and from her were reflected on Christ For His greatest sorrow 
was that His mother suffered so grievously on His account All 
other sorrows Christ suppressed and overcame, manifesting this 
only to His disciples. Now, observe this sorrow of Christ was 
not by compulsion, or involuntary, so as to prevent the exer- 
cise of reason, but was freely undergone by Christ. Whence 
theologians say that in Christ were not passions, but their first

suggestions (propassiones ) ; * for all His affections resulted from 
the ordering of His reason and His own free choice. For to 
this all the inferior powers were perfectly subjected, both in Adam 
and in Christ For original righteousness, which was in Christ 
as in Adam before his fall, required this. See S. Augustine, de 
Civ . xiv. 9, and Damascene (de Fid . iii. 23). Nothing was com- 
pulsory in Christ, for of His own will He hungered, was fearful, 
and was sad. 

5. S. Luke adds, that He sweated blood, and was comforted 
by an angel ; while Isaiah (liil 3) calls Him a man of sorrows. 

But the final and moral grounds of this were manifold. SL 
Chrysostom gives as the 1st: “To show that He took on Himself 
true flesh, He endures human sufferings.” So Jerome and Origen ; 
and S. Leo (Serm, vii. de Pass.) says, “He was despised in our 
humility, made sad with our sadness, and crucified with our 
pain.” 2nd. S. Gregory (Mor. xxiv. 17), “As His death was 
approaching, He set forth in His own person our struggles of 
mind, for we fear greatly the approach of death.” The 3rd. S. 
Ambrose sets forth (in Luke xxii. 44), “In no point do I more 
admire the tenderness and majesty of Christ than in this, which 
most men dread. He would have done much less for me had 
He not taken on Himself my feelings; He took on Him my 
sorrow, that He might now give me joy. I confidently make 
mention of His sorrow, for I preach the Cross. He was obliged 
to endure pain, that He might conquer. Insensibility wins not 
the praise of fortitude. But He wished to instruct us to overcome 
the sorrow of coming death, and perhaps He was sad because, 
after the fall of Adam, death was a necessity, and again because 
He knew that His persecutors would have to pay the penalty of 
their monstrous sacrilege.” And again, “Thou smartest not for 
Thine own wounds, but for ours ; not for Thine own death, but 
for our infirmity.” S. Athanasius (de Cruce) writes thus elegantly, 
“Christ descended to win for us our ascension; was bom that

we might be reconciled to the unborn Father; was made weak 
for our sakes, that we might be raised up by His strength, and 
say with S. Paul, I can do all things through Jesus Christ that 
strengtheneth me. He assumed a corruptible body, that the cor- 
ruptible might put on incorruption ; a mortal body, that mortality 
might put on immortality. Lastly, He became man, and died, 
that we men might by dying become gods, and no longer have 
death reigning over us.” 4th. The fourth was to mitigate the 
dread of death, which was inflicted as a punishment for Adam’s 
sin, and turn it into joy and the hope of attaining a better life. 
Christ then obtained for the martyrs exemption from pain and 
fear in their grievous torments, and caused them to undergo them 
willingly, and even to rejoice in them. “Christ came,” says S. 
Chrysostom, “ to bear our infirmities, and to give us His strength. 
And again, Christ by His agony enabled His faithful ones not to 
fear death, but patiently and even joyfully to meet it from their hope 
in the resurrection, saying with Hosea and S. Paul, as triumphing 
over death, ‘Death is swallowed up in victory’” (1 Cor. xv. 55). 

5th. The fifth was to cure by His sorrow our sloth, weakness, 
fear, &c. As Isaiah (liiL 4) says, “Surely He hath borne our 
griefs and carried our sorrows.” And accordingly our best remedy 
in all these trials is to look at Christ in His agony, that by 
the pattern and merits of the agony He endured in the garden 
He may heal our sorrow. As S. Leo ( Semu iv. dt Pass.) says, 
“He healed our weaknesses by partaking them, and drove away 
the fear of suffering punishment by undergoing it Himself: our 
Lord trembled with our fear, that He might take on Himself our 
weakness, and robe our weakness with His strength.” It was, 
again, to remove the dread of difficulty, which occurs in every 
virtuous act For this dread keeps many back from virtue and 
holiness. Whenever, therefore, any difficulty or temptation assails, 
let us strengthen ourselves by meditating on the agony of Christ ; 
for if He overcame His by the struggle and bloody sweat, we ought 
also to overcome ours by manly resistance. See Heb. xil 1. 

Christ then taught us to fight against our passions with reason

SORROWFUL UNTO DEATH.

and judgment, especially our sloth, sadness, and anxiety. Calvin 
and Beza here impiously and unleamedly accuse Christ of timidity, 
inconstancy, and vacillation, as being indeed more cowardly than 
the martyrs; rather He not only willingly underwent these suf- 
ferings, but brought them of His own accord on Himself, that 
He might by His bold struggle overcome them in Himself, and 
subdue them also in us. For, as & Augustine says, “Christ was 
troubled when exercising His power, and not in His weakness" 
[John xi. 33]. 

Ver. 38. Then saith He unto them , My soul is exceeding sor- 
rcnvful ’ even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with Me . I 
am as sorrowful from the lively apprehension of My sufferings 
and death, as if I were now dying; I seem to be lifeless with 
sorrow and dread. My pain well-nigh takes away My life and 
breath. It is not My flesh, but My soul, which is so very sad, 
for sorrow penetrates the inmost parts of My soul, and cuts it in 
sunder as a sword. “ The waters have come in even to My soul,” 
Ps. lxix. 1. I am but the smallest point removed from death, so 
that the slightest addition to My sorrow would crush Me, and 
take away My life. Consider with what feeling of sorrow and love 
Christ spake these words, — His pathos, His look, His voice, His 
countenance, — Tarry ye here. Wait and behold Me here, deeply 
sorrowing and praying in the agony of death, both as witnesses 
of My sorrow, and to learn from Me in every tribulation to betake 
yourselves to prayer; so that thus watching ye may be some 
solace to Me in My affliction. But it is not so ; for sorrow hath 
overwhelmed you, and forces you to sleep. Whence Christ com- 
plains (Ps. lxix. 21), “I waited for some to have pity on Me, but 
there was no man, neither found I any to comfort Me.” Christ 
from the vehemence of His love wished to pass through His 
unmitigated and wondrous Passion without any consolation or 
consoler. He wished to drain the chalice of gall and bitterness 
unmixed with the sweetness of honey, both in order that His 
redemption should be plenteous, and for an example of heroic 
virtue. For Christ manifested in His Passion the most perfect

acts of heroic virtue. And He Himself was therein ~a prodigy 
of humanity ; for though “ He was in the form of God . . . He 
became obedient as far as unto death, even the death of the 
Cross,” Phil, a 8. He was also therein a prodigy of patience^ 
fortitude, and of charity; for “ greater love hath no man than 
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (John xv. 13). 
But Christ laid down His for His enemies (Rom. v. 8). 

Ver. 39. And He went a little farther, \ and fell on His face. 
For a few steps, that He might pray in secret, and yet be seen 
and heard by them. By this prostration He manifested His 
extreme suffering, gave a striking example of humility, and the 
highest reverence to God the Father. Again, to set forth the 
heavy burden of our sins, which He had taken upon Him, and 
present Himself to the Father in our stead as though guilty and 
penitent, and submit Himself entirely to chastisement, I surrender 
Myself, He says, to Thee, O Father, as guilty, in the place of men. 
I give up Myself entirely to Thee, and present to Thee the punish- 
ment due to them. I offer My back to the scourger, My head to 
the crown of thorns, My hands and feet to the nails, and My entire 
body to the cross. Wound and crucify Me, that man may be 
spared and received back into Thy favour. 

And prayed \ saying. For as man He in a true and proper sense 
prayed to the Father, yea, even to Himself as God. On the spot 
where He prayed a church was erected, and the marks of His 
footsteps were said by Baronius to be still there. 

O My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from Me. 
Absolutely this was possible, but it was impossible according to 
God’s decree that man was to be redeemed by Christ’s death. 
Christ knew this, and therefore did not wish for it absolutely, 
and asks for nothing contrary to His own and the Father’s will 
But He merely expresses His natural shrinking from death, His 
ineffectual and conditionated will, and yet freely submitted Him- 
self to the contrary will of God, that He should die. 

Let this cup pass from Me. Calvin here accuses our Lord of 
hastiness, forgetfulness, ignorance, darkness of mind, inconstancy,

THE CUP IN THE GARDEN.

and opposition to the Divine will — in fact, ascribing to Him sin. 
But, as I before observed, Christ took all this upon Him 
voluntarily, yet in accordance with the will of God. His first 
act was subordinated to the latter act, and was therefore regu- 
lated and ordered by right reason; for nothing in Christ could 
be disordered and out of place. Reason, then, and the higher 
nature were justly unwilling that His inferior nature should feel 
sorrow and horror of death, as stated above. 2. S. Jerome under- 
stands by the 44 cup,” the sin of the Jews. I pray, O Father, that 
I may not suffer at the hand of the Jews, my kinsmen. For in 
killing Me they commit a most awful crime, and will be punished 
most severely in helL But this is too restricted a meaning. 

3. The full and adequate meaning is, that this cup of suffering 
should pass away, even though Thou hast decreed that I should 
drink it to the dregs ; and thus (as Origen says) it should pass away 
from Himself, and the whole race of mankind. 

4. S. Catharine of Sienna offered two other explanations, which 
she said were revealed to her by Christ The first, that Christ most 
eagerly thirsted for this cup, to manifest His love to the Father, and 
to effect our redemption. He wished to die and suffer immediately. 
His love admitted not any delay. I wish the cup to pass away, 
and that I may return at once to Thee. This was the prayer of 
His spirit, though in His flesh He dreaded death. The two 
meanings are compatible. But why did He not effect His wish ? 
It was (1) in order to give the martyrs an example of longing 
for the Cross ; (2) Because so many would be unthankful for His 
Passion, and would die in their sins ; and as this was His greatest 
sorrow, He prays that this 44 cup” might be taken away, and 
that all might be saved. But yet He chose to conform Himself 
to His Father’s will, 44 Not My will,” &c. So S, Catharine, not 
taking it literally, but expressing the holy and ardent affection 
of Christ 

Symbolically: S. Hilary says, 44 Christ took all our infirmities 
and nailed them to the Cross, and therefore that cup could not 
pass away from Him without His drinking it, for we cannot

suffer except through His Passion.” May that cup, O Father, 
pass over to My own followers, that when enduring My sufferings 
they may experience also through My gift My strength and power 
to endure. 

S. Bernard (Serm. x. in Cant.) piously and wisely remarks, “ The 
cup Thou didst drink, the mark of our redemption, makes Thee 
above all things lovely. It is this which readily claims our entire 
love. It both more tenderly attracts our devotion, more justly 
demands it, binds us to Thee the more firmly, and affects us the 
more vehemently. For great was the Saviour’s labour, greater than 
in the work of creation. For He spake and it was done. But 
here He had those who contradicted His words, watched His 
actions, jested at Him in His torments, and reproached Him in 
His death. Behold how He loved 1 Learn thou, O Christian, 
from Christ Himself, how to love Him. Learn to love Him 
sweetly, wisely, and firmly: sweetly, that we may not be allured 
away; wisely, that we be not deceived; and firmly, that we may 
not by force be drawn away from the love of the Lord,” &c. 

Nevertheless , not as I willy but as Thou wilt. Here it is plain, as 
against the Monothelites, that there are two wills in Christ : not only 
the Divine, to supply the place of the human will, as they said, but the 
will He had as man, by which He obtained our redemption. The 
Sixth Synod (Acts 4 and 10) proves that there were in Him two wills, 
and that the human was by obedience subject to the Divine ; and 
this on the authority of SS. Athanasius, Augustine, Ambrose, and 
Leo. Nay, rather, though the human will was in itself one, yet in 
its power and action it was twofold, the one natural, with which 
it shrank from death; the other rational and free, with which 
He subjected Himself to the will of God. " Nevertheless, not 
what I will” naturally, “ but what Thou wilt.” By My reasonable 
will I subject My natural will to Thee, O Father, and only will 
what Thou wiliest And, accordingly, the natural will of Christ 
was conditional and of no avail, because it wished to escape 
death only under the condition that it pleased God. But His 
rational will was absolute and effectual, because He embraced

death for the same reason that God willed it, that is, for man’s 
redemption. But the natural will of Christ seemed materially 
contrary to the Divine will. But by the rule of subordination it 
was conformable to it, as suffering itself to be guided by the 
rational will, and thus by the Divine will ; and, on the other hand, 
the will of God, as well as the rational will of Christ, wishes on 
deliberate and just ground that His natural will should express 
this natural fear of death. In both aspects, therefore, was the will 
of Christ in all respects conformable to the Divine. Christ here 
teaches us, as a moral duty, that our sole remedy in affliction is 
submission to the Divine will, and that in every temptation we 
must betake ourselves to the aid of God, who alone can free us 
from them or strengthen us under them if we submit ourselves 
humbly, reverently, and lovingly to His will. “ This voice of the 
Head,” says S. Leo, “ is the salvation of the whole body. It 
taught the faithful, it inspired confessors, it crowned the martyrs. 
For who could overcome the hatred of the world, the whirlwinds of 
temptations, the terrors of persecution, had not Christ in all and 
for all said in submission to His Father, Thy will be done?” 

Ver. 40. And He cometh to His disciples and findeth them asleep, 
and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with Me one hour t 
To gain some consolation, little though it were, and also as having 
care for His people ; thus teaching bishops and pastors to do the 
like, and to break off prayer in order to visit them. They were 
sleeping for sorrow, and He speaks to Peter as the head of the 
rest, and as having so boldly professed his allegiance to Christ. 

But observe how gently and tenderly He reproves them. He 
does not reproach them with their grand promises ; but He merely 
says, “Could ye not?” Ye wished indeed to watch, but I attribute 
your sleep not to your will, but to your weakness: arouse your- 
selves, overcome your infirmity, shake off sleep. 

Mystically : “ He signified,” says S. Irenseus, “ that His Passion 
is the awakening of sleepers.” 

Ver. 41. Watch and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . Of deny- 
ing and forsaking Me for fear of the Jews. If My dangers move

you not, may your own do so. There hangs over you the great 
temptation of denying Me; watch and pray to overcome it “The 
more spiritual a man is,” says Origen, “ the more anxious should he 
be lest his great goodness should have a great fall” Watchfulness 
and prayer are the great means of foreseeing and overcoming 
the arts of devils and men. 

Enter into temptation . Be not ensnared, as birds in a net and 
fishes with a hook. Not to be tempted is often not in our own 
power, nor is it God’s will for us. He wills we should be tempted, 
to try our faith, to increase our virtue, and to crown our deserts. 
But we must not enter into temptation, so that it should occupy, 
possess, and rule over us. So Theophylact and S. Jerome. 

The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak. I know your 
readiness in spirit, but your weakness in the flesh. By the flesh 
is meant our natural feelings, which shrink from suffering and 
death. Pray, therefore, that your weak flesh may not enfeeble your 
spirit and compel it to deny Me ; but may God by His grace so 
strengthen both your spirit and your flesh, that ye may not only be 
ready, but strong to overcome all adversities, so that for My sake 
ye may eagerly wish for death, and bravely endure it. “ The more, 
therefore,” says S. Jerome, “ we trust to the warmth of our feelings, 
the more let us fear for the weakness of the flesh.” Some under- 
stand (less suitably) by “spirit” the devil, by the “flesh” man. 
That is, the devil is powerful to tempt, man is feeble to resist 
Origen, moreover, observes “ the flesh of all is weak, but it is only 
the spirit of the saints which is ready to mortify the deeds of the 
flesh.” S. Mark adds, “And they knew not what to answer, for 
they were struck down by their grief, and oppressed with sleep, 
and had neither sense nor understanding. 

Ver. 42. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying \ 
O My Father, if this cup may not pass away unless I drink it. Thy 
will be done. S. Mark says that He used the same words as 
before. But S. Matthew omitted the first part of the prayer as 
without efficacy or meaning, and in order to insist on the latter 
part in which the whole force of the passage consists, and set it

forth for our imitation. For Christ absolutely wished and prayed 
to drink the cup of His Passion, which was decreed and destined 
for Him by the will of God. For He plainly and expressly asked 
that the will of God might be fulfilled in Him in and through all 
things 

Ver. 43. And He came and found them asleep again, for their 
eyes were heavy . With sorrow and watching, and afterwards with 
sleep. “ For,” says S. Chrysostom, “it was a wild night,” adding 
that “Christ did not reprove them, since their weakness was 
great.” 

Ver. 44. And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the 
third time, using the same words . 1st. To show the intensity of 

His sorrow ; for, as S. Luke says, He sweated blood, and an angel 
comforted Him. But this was only when He prayed the third 
time, and not the first and second time, as Jansen maintains. 2nd. 
To teach us that if God hears us not in our first prayer, we should 
pray more frequently and fervently, till He hears us, and we obtain 
our request Perseverance crowns the work, in prayer especially. 
And if Christ was not heard in His first and second prayer, what 
wonder if we are not heard at once ? Let us persevere, and we 
shall gain the fruit of our prayer, strengthening, calming of sorrow, 
and power of mind to withstand and overcome our trials. 

Symbolically: 1. Remigius says, “He prays thrice for the 
Apostles, and especially for Peter, who was about to deny Him 
thrice.” 2. Rabanus says “that He prayed thrice, in order that 
we should ask pardon for past sins, protection in present, and 
caution in future perils; that we should direct all our prayers to 
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and that our body, soul, and 
spirit should be preserved blameless.” 3. S. Augustine ( Qucest . 
Evang. in loc.) says, “ It is not unreasonable to conclude that our 
Lord prayed thrice, in consequence of our temptation being three- 
fold. For as the temptation of desire is threefold, so also is the 
temptation of fear. The fear of death is opposed to the desire of 
curiosity. For as in the one there is the desire of knowledge, so 
in the other is the fear of losing it But to the desire for honour

or praise there is opposed the fear of disgrace and contumely, 
and to the desire of pleasure there is opposed the fear of pain.” 

Ver. 45. Then cometh He to His disciples , and saith unto them. 
Being after His third prayer strengthened by an angel, He resumed 
His former courage and spirit, and nobly composed Himself to 
meet His Passion (see on Luke xxii. 41). 

Sleep on now , and take your rest. S. Chrysostom and others 
suppose that this was said ironically. This is no time for sleeping 
in our moment of extreme peril ; rouse yourselves now, if ever. 

But S. Augustine (de Cons . Evan. iiL 4), and Bede after him, 
suppose that Christ spoke seriously, and in compassion for them 
granted them a little longer rest “ Sleep on for the short time 
that remains till Judas arrives.” 

Behold, the hour has arrived. Fixed from eternity by the Father, 
and decreed for My Passion and death. 

And the Son of Man is betrayed, i.e., is about to be betrayed 
into the hands of sinners — sinners in a special manner, such as 
Judas and the Jews who were raging against Him. For there 
was no nation more wicked at that time, and therefore Christ had 
resolved to be bom and die at that very time, in order that He 
might suffer more atrocious cruelties from such a people. His 
supreme goodness resolved to do battle with their consummate 
malice, in order that He might crush in them, as its head, the 
malice of all men, subject it to Himself, and convert it into 
goodness. The divine clemency and power of Christ were equally 
manifested in converting to Himself and making saints of those 
self-same wicked Jews, by Peter and the other apostles. 

Ver. 46. Rise, let us be going: behold, he hath come who will betray 
Me. He bids them rise, not in order to fly with Him, but to go 
forth to meet Judas. It is hence clear that Christ was heard in 
His last prayer; that, comforted of God by the angel, He had 
thrown off His sadness and sorrow, and went forth to meet Judas 
and the death of the cross with great and noble resolution. “ For,” 
as Origen says, “He saw in the spirit Judas the traitor drawing 
nigh, though he was not yet seen by the disciples.” “ He therefore

in every way teaches His disciples,*' says S. Chrysostom, “ that this 
was not a matter of necessity or of weakness, but of a certain 
incomprehensible dispensation, for He foresaw that they were 
coming, and so far from flying, He went forth to meet them.** 

Christ in thus going forth, as indeed in the whole of His 
Passion, left three points most worthy of notice. 1st His inno- 
cence in boldly going forth to meet His enemies. 2nd. His majesty, 
forethought, and power, wherewith as God He orders and foretells 
the approach of His enemies, and so moderates their fury that they 
could do no more than He permitted and foreordained. 3rd. The 
readiness with which He voluntarily met Judas, to show that 
it was not from weakness or unwillingness, but with the highest 
dignity, condescension, and generous love that He suffered and 
died for us. “Rise, let us be going," to meet Judas; and, asS. 
Jerome says, “ let us go of our own accord to death.” 

Morally: Christ here teaches us to arouse ourselves, and go 
forth to meet our sufferings. It is the act of an heroic mind 
to weaken by its own resolution the force of any imminent 
evil, and by voluntarily embracing it to overcome and subdue it 
Great evils are more easily overcome by a great mind than 
minor evils by a small one. As says the poet, “Yield not to 
trials; boldly go to meet them, as a lion shuts its eyes when 
rushing on its foes" (Plin. N, H. viii. 16). The cross therefore 
pursues those who fly from it, and flies those who seek for it 
As is said of honour. 

Ver. 47. And while He yet spake , lo, Judas , one of the twelve , came, 
&c. This is more fully set forth, John xviii. 2. The truth of His 
prediction and foreordaining was thus made good. He so inter- 
wove Judas* sin and His Passion, that the whole action appeared 
to be partly permitted and partly ordained by Him. 

Lo> JudaS) one of the twelve . Lo is an expression of wonder. 
An unheard-of portent, a stupendous crime, that one of the 
Apostles was not only a thief and robber, but the traitor, and the 
leader of those who killed Christ 1 “ He went before them," says 
S. Luke

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


A great multitude: of Roman soldiers, high priests* servants, &c. 

Staves: tipped with iron, as spears, &c., or not so tipped, as 
clubs. Observe here the folly and madness of Judas and the Jews. 
He knew that He was a very great prophet, nay, the Son of God, 
who could not be overcome by force, as the Jews well knew, and 
yet, maddened with avarice and fury, they bring armed men to 
use violence towards Him, to seize and bind Him. Dost thou 
wish, O Judas, to bind God, to seize the Almighty, to fight, O 
petty men, against your Creator, and compel Him to give Himself 
into your hands? “It was avarice,” says S. Chrysostom, “which 
inspired him with this madness, avarice which makes all its slaves 
cruel and fierce; for if the covetous man neglect his own salva- 
tion, what will he care for another ? 

Ver. 48. Now he that betrayed Him gave them a sign , saying. 
Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is He: hold him fast Lest He 
escape, as He did at other times. “And lead Him away care- 
fully,” adds S. Mark. For Judas was afraid lest Christ should 
escape by changing His shape, and that He should thus lose the 
thirty pieces of silver, which were not as yet given, but only 
promised. 

Gave them a sign . That the Roman soldiers might know him. 
For it was night. And perhaps, as some modems suggest, from 
His likeness to S. James the Less, His kinsman. 

I shall kiss . Origen mentions a tradition that Christ had two 
countenances, one natural, the other assumed at will, as at His 
transfiguration, and that Judas gave this sign for fear Christ should 
alter His appearance, so as not to be recognised. But this is a 
gratuitous assumption, and not to the point, for Judas was not 
present at the Transfiguration; and even had he been there, he 
might reasonably fear that Christ might render Himself invisible, 
as He knew He had done at other times. The true reason is as 
given above. 

Ver. 49. And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said \ Hail , 
Master; and kissed Him . Judas knew from Christ’s words at the 
Last Supper that he and his treachery were known to Christ ; but

KISS OF JUDAS.

yet, in order to hide it from the other Apostles, he pretends to give 
Christ the usual mark of friendship and reverence. It was the 
ancient mode of salutation. The Apostles probably saluted 
Christ in this manner, when returning back to Him from some 
other place. The early Christians also used to salute each other 
in the same way (see Tert. de Orat. % and i Cor. xvi. 20). But 
Judas most wickedly misused this token of friendship for the 
purpose of betrayal, being persuaded (says S. Chrysostom) that 
Christ in His gentleness would not reject his kiss, and that if 
He rejected it, the sign would yet have been given. S. Victor of 
Antioch says, “ The unhappy man gave the kiss of peace to Him 
against whom he was laying deadly snares.” “ Giving,” says pseudo- 
Jerome, “the sign of the kiss with the poison of deceit.” More- 
over, though Christ felt deeply, and was much pained at His 
betrayal by Judas, yet He refused not his kiss, and gave him a 
loving kiss in return. 1. “ That He might not seem to shrink from 
treachery ” (S. Ambrose in Luke xxi. 45), but willingly to embrace 
it, and even greater indignities, for our sake. 2. To soften and 
pierce the heart of Judas (S. Ambrose, ibid.) ; and 3. To teach us 
to love our enemies and those whom we know would rage against 
us (S. Hilary). For Christ hated not, but loved the traitor, and 
grieved more at his sin than at His own betrayal, and accordingly 
strove to lead him to repentance. Just as the spark of fire is 
elicited from the steel, so was Christ’s latent love elicited by His 
blows and sufferings. His love was pre-eminent through the whole 
of His Passion. 

Ver. 50. And Jesus said unto Him , Friend \ wherefore art thou 
comet If thou comest to betray Me, why givest thou Me this 
friendly kiss ? But if thou comest as a friend, why bringest thou 
so many enemies against Me? “Thou kissest Me,” says S. 
Augustine, “and layest snares for Me. Thou pretendest to be a 
friend, though thou art a traitor.” Hence Luke adds that Christ 
said, “Judas, why betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?** 
And such words, full of majesty and love, ought to have wounded 
his stony heart, unless he had hardened it like iron.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


It was a wondrous instance of Christ's gentleness and patience, 
that He tolerated Judas for three years, and deprived him not 
of his Apostolate, or disclosed to any one his sin. Teaching 
us to overcome our wrongs by love. 

The Saints in this matter imitated Christ, S. Martin especially 
in his treatment of Brice, one of his clerks, who was constantly 
calumniating him. And when blamed for it, he said, “Christ 
bore with Judas the traitor, and should not I bear with Brice my 
calumniator ? ” By this gentleness he so won upon him, that he 
amended his ways, became a Saint, and succeeded S. Martin as 
Bishop, as S. Martin had foretold (Sulp. in Vit. S. Martin), 

The passage, John xviii. 4, should here come in, in the regular 
course of the narrative. 

To harmonise S. John with the other Evangelists the order 
of the history is as follows: — Judas preceded the crowd by a few 
steps, so as not to seem to be one of them ; and then, when he 
had kissed Christ, he drew back into the crowd again, and when 
Jesus boldly confronted the crowd, Judas was standing with them. 
Jesus thus boldly asked them, “Whom seek ye?” and on Jesus 
saying that He was Jesus of Nazareth whom they were seeking, 
they were thunderstruck, and fell to the ground; not on their 
faces, but backward, so as to make it clear that they were struck 
down by His power. He allowed them, however, to rise up again, 
and on their saying again that they were seeking Christ, He 
replied, “ I told you that I am He ; if, therefore, ye seek Me, let 
these go their way,” showing that He cared more for them than 
for Himself. 

Observe (with S. Chrysostom and S. Cyril) that the eyes of the 
soldiers were miraculously blinded, so that they could not discern, 
and much less lay hold on Christ. (S. Augustine thinks other- 
wise.) They gather this from the reply, “We seek Jesus of 
Nazareth,” as though they knew not it was He. S. Chrysostom 
and others suppose that even Judas did not recognise Him. But 
he seems to have withdrawn rather from horror at his crime. For 
Christ cut him off from the Apostolic band, “Begone, O traitor;

•sMine, ” and 


thou art not worthy of the companionship of Me an&sMine, ” and 
then struck him and the whole band to the earth. This tau t he • 
first miracle which Christ wrought when He was seized, to manifest 
His Divine majesty and omnipotence, and that the Jews, might 
learn that they would have come in vain against Him with the 
armed band, had not He given Himself gracefully and willingly 
into their hands. The Sodomites were struck with a like blindness 
(Gen. xix. n). “ Seest thou His surprising power, that though 

standing in their midst He struck them blind ? ” says S. Chrysostom 
and S. Cyril. “The divine power of Christ shone forth in that, 
though He presented Himself to those who sought Him, He 
was not recognised.” Symbolically S. Augustine in John xviii 
The eternal day was so hid by human form,* as to be sought for 
with lanterns and torches, in order to be slain by the darkness. 

2. His second miracle was His striking them to the ground by 
the single word, “I am He.” “That word, ‘I am He/ struck 
them down like a thunderbolt,” says S. Leo. “Where was their 
cruel conspiracy? where their glowing anger? where their array 
of weapons? The Lord saith, I am He, and at His voice the 
multitude of the ungodly falls prostrate. What will His Majesty 
do hereafter in judgment, when His humility, though about to be 
judged, had such power?” 

Though “ I am He ” means only “ He whom ye seek,” yet 
Rupertus explains it, “I am that I am” (Exod. iii.). And S. 
Jerome (Ep. cxl. ad Prindpium) thinks that Christ struck down 
these guards with the heavenly splendour of His countenance, for 
otherwise the Apostles would not have followed Him, nor would 
those who came to lay hold on Him have fallen to the earth. 

Allegorically: This fall of Judas and his followers signified the 
comparable fall of the Jews, who would be obstinate in their 
unbelief, and well-nigh incapable of salvation. “Their fall is 
an image of all those who oppose Christ.” S. Cyr. Alex. 
in John xviii. and S. Augustine in loe. “Where is now the

band of soldiers, the terror and defence of weapons? A single 
word, without a weapon, struck down, smote, laid prostrate that 
crowd, fierce in hatred and terrible in arms. For God was veiled 
in flesh. What will He do when He comes in judgment, who 
wrought this when He came to be judged ? ” 

Tropologically : Here is represented the fall of the reprobate* 
for they fall on their back so that they cannot arise; but when 
the elect sin, they fall on their face, because they are soon touched 
by God, and rise up in penitence. “We fall on our face,” says 
S. Gregory (Horn. viii. in Ez,) t “because we blush for our sins, 
which we remember to have committed.” And also (Afor. xiil io), 
“To fall on the face is for every one to acknowledge his own 
faults in this life, and to bewail them with penitence. But to 
fall on the back, where we cannot see, is to depart suddenly out 
of life, and to know not to what punishment we are brought.” 

Again, “The righteous fall on their face, as looking on those 
things that are before; but sinners fall on their back, as seeking 
for those things which are behind and pass away, and are soon 
gone.” “For everything which passes away,” says S. Gregory 
(Afor, xxxiii. 23), “is behind, while everything which is coming 
and is permanent is before.” 

3. The third miracle, as S. Chrysostom and S. Augustine 
remark, was that which He wrought by His all-powerful providence 
and the efficacy of His word. “ Let these go their way,” that the 
Jews laid hands on none of the disciples. He offered Himself 
alone to death, as a good shepherd laying down His life for the

how great was their blindness and malice, who, after they had seen 
so many miracles, dared to lay hands on Him 1 

Then came they and laid hands on Jesus % and took Him, The

THE TWO SWORDS.

forth his hand, \ and struck the servant of the high priest Peter, 
that is, who was more fervent and resolute than the others. S. 
Luke adds that he first asked permission from Christ, “Shall we 
smite with the sword?” but waited not for His answer, and in his 
zeal for Christ in His imminent danger drew his sword. 

A question is raised, what was this sword ? merely a knife (culter), 
or a military sword (ensis), or an ordinary sword {gladius )? The 
Fathers are in favour of ensis* S. Hilary says that the sword was 
ordered to be sheathed, because He was about to destroy them 
with no human sword, but with the word of His mouth (Rev. 
i. 16, xix. 15). & Ambrose explains the two swords (Luke xxiL 
38) mystically, as the Old and New Testaments, with which we are 
armed against the wiles of the devil 

But writers on all sides explain these two swords allegorically 
as the twofold power of the Church, temporal and spiritual (see 
Extrav. “ Unatn sanctam ” De Majoritate et obedientia). And 
again by the sword is denoted excommunication, which cuts off 
a man from the Church. 

Many think that Peter intended to kill Malchus, but that God 
guided the blow so that he merely cut off his ear. 

Tropologically : S. Ambrose by this sword understands martyrdom. 
“There is,” saith he, “the sword of suffering, by which thou 
canst cast off the body, and purchase for thyself the crown of a 
martyr by putting off the slough of the body.” Cornelius urges 
many reasons why it should be a sword, and not merely a knife 
which S. Peter used, adding that the sword of Peter is still pre- 
served, and exposed to the veneration of the faithful. 

A servant of the high priest named Malchus (John xviii. 10). 
S. Peter seems to have attacked him, as being the most bold and 
forward in assailing Christ 

Cut off his ear His right ear, say S. John and S. Luke, 
signifying, as Origen says, that the Jews in reading and hearing

of Paradise, and the sword of the Spirit (Eph. vi. 17).

Scriptures had lost their right ear, the true understanding of 
heavenly things. 

S. Augustine (contr. Faust, xxii. 70) remarks that Moses, after 
he had smitten the Egyptian, was made the head of the Synagogue. 
S. Peter, after mutilating Malchus, was made the head of the 
Church. Both of them went beyond bounds, not from hateful 
cruelty, but from blameless impetuosity. For Peter sinned 
through rashness, for it was without the knowledge, rather* 
against the will of Christ that he drew his sword, his sole means 
of defending Christ against so many armed men, and in cutting 
off Malchus’ ear he provoked them the rather against Christ 
But he showed his ardour and zeal for Christ, blameable as it 
was; and when this fault had been corrected at Pentecost, he 
obtained through Him to be the Pastor and Prince of the 
Church. 

Christ by blaming and restraining S. Peter, and by healing 
Malchus’ ear, manifested most strikingly His power and clemency. 
Especially since it is a theological dogma (as Paulus de Palatio 
adds) that when the Lord heals, He heals perfectly. If Christ 
healed Malchus both in body and mind, what greater proof could 
there be of charity, what stronger evidence of an undisturbed 
mind ? It is clear from Acts ii. 37 that many of these perse- 
cutors of Christ were converted. And what marvel if Malchus 
were, who had experienced so striking an evidence of Christ’s 
goodness and i>ower? Christ thus acted that He might furnish 
no ground for the charge that He had opposed the public 
ministers of justice, and also to exhibit a pattern of forbearance 
and gentleness, as He did when He converted Saul into Paul 
Mystically, the Gloss says that the wounding and healing Malchus* 
ear is the restoration of hearing, when the old man is taken away, 
for slavery is the old estate, healing is liberty. 

Ver. 52. Then Jesus saith to him , Put up again thy sword into 
his place. Christ here reproves Peter’s rashness in drawing his

sword against His wish. Peter’s sin, then, was twofold: first in 
striking against Christ’s wish, and next, because this was an act 
not so much of defence as of revenge, which did not help to 
deliver Christ from the soldiers, but rather excited them the more 
against Him. But Peter, says S. Chrysostom, was hurried on by 
his eagerness to protect Christ, and did not think of this, but 
remembered rather His words, that Christ had ordered them to 
take two swords, inferring that it was for His defence. And 
accordingly he thought that in striking the servant he was acting 
according to the mind of Christ, “ Let revenge cease, let patience 
be exhibited, ” says the Interlinear Gloss. 

For all they that take the stvord (without proper authority). To 
strike, and wound others. To take the sword by public autho- 
rity to punish the guilty, or in a just war, is lawful and honest 

Shall perish with the sword. Deserve thus to perish (Gen. ix. 6) 
(see Aug. Quasi. V. and N. T., cap. civ.). Homicides, moreover, 
and gladiators very often die violent deaths in war or by casualties 
(see Act xxviii. 4). 

And Christ here insinuates that the Jews would perish by the 
swords of the Romans. S. Luke adds that Christ said, “Suffer 
ye thus far.” “Cease to draw your swords, ye have contended 
sufficiently,” just as we part two combatants. But Cajetan explains 
otherwise, “Suffer the Jews to rage against Me, while their hour 
lasts, and the power of darkness.” Hence Maldonatus and 
others infer that the other Apostles, when they saw S. Peter’s 
zeal, wished to fight for Him also, but were forbidden by Christ 
For, says S. Ambrose (in Luke xxii.), He who wished to save 
all by His own wounds, wished not to be saved by the wounding 
of His persecutors. Whence the motto, “Health by wounds,” 
which is specially applicable to Christ by whose stripes we are 
healed (1 Pet ii. 24). 

Ver. 53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, 
and He will give Me more than twelve legions of angels t A 
second reason for our Lord forbidding Peter to defend Him. 

I need not thy aid, since I have at My command all the armies

of angels, one of whom slew the host of the Assyrians (2 Kings 
xix. 35). “If one angel,” says S. Chrysostom, “slew so many 
thousands of armed men, what would twelve legions of them do 
against one thousand?” He accommodated His discourse to 
their wish, for they were already half dead with fear. “ For Christ 
Himself as God needed not their aid,” as Origen remarked; 
“ they much rather needed His,” to whom thousands of thousands 
ministered (see Dan. vii. 10). 

Christ is within bounds in speaking as He does. For angels 
are countless, exceeding the number of all men, past, present, 
and future (see S. Dion, de Cel Bier. S. Thom, part 1, quasi. 
a, art. 3). 

Christ here teaches us in every danger to invoke our guardian 
angels, as most wise, powerful, and full of love for us, as knowing 
that God orders this to be so. Con£ Ps. xci. u, xxxiv. 7; 
Gen. xxxiL 1, &c. 

Ver. 54. But how then shall the Scriptures he fulfilled \ that thus 
it must bet And if Scripture foretells My sufferings, “Why do ye 
oppose it?” says S. Chrysostom. This, then, is the third reason 
why Christ prohibits His defence by arms. “Though He might 
have these legions, He was unwilling to have them, in order that 
the Scriptures might be fulfilled, that it was fitting He should 
thus suffer.” For we owe that reverence to the word of God, as 
not to oppose, but to assent to it and make it good. But thou 
wilt say, “The Jews then did no sin in killing Christ, because 
they merely fulfilled the Scriptures.” S. Athanasius {de Cruce) 
denies the inference. “For they did sin thus boldly against 
Christ, as fulfilling the words of prophecy, but merely of their 
own accord, so that the Prophet was not the cause of their acts, 
but their own free will Or rather, they themselves caused the 
Prophets to predict such things of them.” The Jews then per- 
petrated this sacrilegious murder from their own wickedness and 
hatred of Christ, and the Prophets only foresaw and foretold it 
They did not approve, or order the Jews to do it But God 
ordered Christ to bear it all, and thus atone for the sins of mea

CHRIST DRINKS WILLINGLY. 


223 


"Pleasing the suffering, though the deed displeased.” Hence S. 
Leo ( Serm . i. de Pass.) says, "We have nothing to thank you for, 

0 ye Jews ; we owe nought to thee, O Judas. For your wickedness 

promoted our salvation without your will, and that was wrought 
by you which the hand and counsel of God decreed to be done. 
That death thus sets us free, but is a charge against you. Ye 
only justly lose that which ye wished all to lose.” See on 
Acts ii. 23. 4. The fourth reason is given by S. John (xviii. n). 

" The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it ? 
God ordained this cup of the Passion from all eternity, and now 
gives it Me to drink. Shall I not eagerly take it from His hand, 
and gladly drain it out?” Observe, He had before deprecated it 
as a very bitter cup of gall, but now, on knowing the Father’s 
will, He embraces it, as full of honeyed sweetness. For what is 
sweeter than for Him to obey God, to offer Himself as a holocaust 
to God, to make Himself a sacrifice to God for the salvation 
of men? "How sweetly,” says S. Bernard (Serm. ii. in Pent.), 
"didst Thou hold converse with men How abundantly didst 
Thou bestow on them many and great blessings ! How boldly 
didst Thou suffer such indignities and cruelties for men, so as to 
draw honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone 1” 
(Deut xxxii. 13). Which was hard set against Thy words, harder 
still at Thy wounds, most hard at the horrors of the Cross; for 
in all these sufferings He was as a lamb before His shearers, and 
opened not His mouth (Isa. liii. 7). 

Ver. 55. In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye 
come out as against a thief, with swords and staves for to take Me f 

1 sat daily with you teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on 
Me. He had before reproved Peter and the Apostles when they 
drew their swords; He now reproves still more severely Judas 
and the Jews who wished to take Him; exhibiting in this way 
wonderful loftiness, freedom, and calmness of mind. For He 
said this when He was still free. It was just after He had healed 
Malchus’ ear. Shame on you, He would say, to come and seize 
Me by night, as a thief 1 I am no thief, but publicly taught the

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


Jews in the Temple. Why did ye not seize Me then? I know 
why you seek to take Me, but I know also that ye were afraid to 
take Me in the Temple on account of the people. Deal with Me 
now as you please ; I surrender Myself willingly ; bind Me, scourge 
Me at your will, &c This is your hour, and the power of 
darkness . And ye therefore fittingly come to seize Me by night, 
because I am the light of the world, and have openly taught the 
light of truth in the light of day. But ye as children of darkness 
shun the light and love darkness, and therefore do ye seize Me 
in the darkness. So say Bede and Theophylact, and S. Leo 
(Serm. viii. de Pass.), “The sons of darkness rushed against the 
true Light, and though using torches and lanterns, yet escaped not 
the darkness of unbelief, because they knew not the Author of 
light,” &c. 

It is clear from S. Luke that it was after these words that the 
Jews laid hands on Jesus. The order of events (see ver. 50) is 
here transposed by S. Matthew, who wished to bring together at 
one time all that related to the seizure of Christ without regard to 
the order of time. 

Lastly, how cruel and insulting was this seizure of Christ ! 
First, as being seized as a malefactor, though most innocent, and 
in Himself, as God, boundless and uncreated sanctity. Secondly, 
in being seized by the vilest of men, and His greatest enemies. 
Thirdly, in being forsaken by the Apostles. Fourthly, because by 
these His bonds He wished to loose the most grievous and hard 
bonds of our sins (see Lam. iv. 20). Fifthly, because He wished 
in this way to animate Christians and martyrs especially to bear 
boldly their imprisonment and bonds, as S. Paul did, Eph. iil 1, 
and S. Chrysostom in toe. The bonds of many martyrs were 
cruel, but those of Christ were more cruel still 

This crowd consisted of a thousand soldiers, and also of many 
attendants and servants of the high priest Sec John xviil 12. 

Ver. 56. But ait this was done that the Scriptures of the 
Prophets might be fulfilled. These are the words of the Evangelist,

FLIGHT OF THE DISCIPLES. 


225 


counsel of God, who willed that Christ should take them all on 
Himself, and suffer for the salvation of man. And He willed also 
that the Prophets should foretell them. 

Then all the disciples forsook Him , and fled. As He foretold 
(ver. 31), they fled because they saw no hope of assisting Him, 
and were afhdd lest they themselves should be seized and evil 
entreated by the Jews. “They were more ready,” says Bede 
(in Mark xiv. 49), “to take safety in flight, than to suffer boldly 
with Christ” For, as Origen says, “ the Spirit was not yet given ” 
(John vii. 39). Was this flight of the Apostles allowable ? Some 
say there was little blame in it, because they inwardly and in 
their minds clave to Christ, though in outward act they fled, as 
being no longer able to help Him. They were therefore wise in 
flying, to avoid the risk of either denying Christ or of suffering 
hardship. But when they had received at Pentecost the gift of 
the Holy Spirit, they boldly exposed themselves to every trial 
This flight of theirs was defective, as arising from fear and failing 
in resolution, but not unlawful and wicked. 

But others regard it as unlawful, as springing from distrust in 
Christ, and despairing of His aid, by which act they tacitly denied 
Christ The first opinion I said (ver. 31) was the most probable. 
They sinned therefore venially, as struck down by sudden and 
excessive fear, and without His command or assent. For having 
experienced so often Christ’s aid in danger, they ought to have 
still trusted in it, especially after His recent displays of power. 
They ought to have sought for His aid, and to have prayed, Lord, 
help us I what wouldst Thou have us to do ? And Christ no doubt 
would have told them. S. Mark here speaks of the young man 
who left his linen cloak and fled away naked. Who he was, and 
why he did so, we shall read in S. Mark. 

Ver. 57. But they that had laid hold on Jesus led Him away 
to Caiaphas the High Priest , where the scribes and elders were 
assembled. S. John mentions that they led Him first to Annas, 
the father-in-law to Caiaphas. This was out of respect to Annas 

as the elder, or because he especially wished fhat Christ should

be taken. Whence S. Cyril and F. Lucas think that the price of 
Judas’ betrayal was paid him there, or because the house of Annas 
was on the road (see on S. John xviii. 13). For it was in the 
house of Caiaphas that Christ was first examined, smitten, and 
denied by S. Peter, as is clear from S. Matthew, S. Mark, and S. 
Luke; and S. John (xviii. 19) also insinuates the same when be 
says “that the High Priest questioned Jesus.” For when he says 
(ver. 24) that Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas, it must be con- 
sidered an analepsis. For John merely goes back to what he had 
omitted, for fear any one should conclude from his previous 
statement that Christ had been examined by Annas and not by 
Caiaphas. Some transpose ver. 24 and put it in after ver. 13, as 
S. Cyril does. So Origen, S. Augustine (de Cons . Evang. cap. vl), 
Jansen, &c. 

Were assembled. He says not “were called together,” for this 
had been done when Judas requested Caiaphas’ soldiers to take 
Christ For it was then that Caiaphas summoned the Scribes and 
Elders to judge and condemn Him as soon as Judas brought Him 
before them. For they had conceived a deadly hatred against 
Christ, and thirsted for His death. “They sat watching all the 
night in Caiaphas’ house,” says S. Chrysostom. 

Ver. 58. But Peter followed Him afar off. Peter alone gathered 
courage, and partly from curiosity, but more from love of Jesus, 
followed Him; but yet it was “afar off,” for fear he should be 
seized by the soldiers, both as a disciple of Jesus, and also as 
having cut off Malchus’ ear. His flight was a token of fear, his 
return a token of love overmastering his fear. “Peter,” says 
S. Ambrose in Luke xxil, “is deserving our highest admiration 
for not forsaking the Lord even when afraid ; his fear was natural, 
his care for Him was from affection ; his fear alien to his nature, 
his not flying natural; his following Him was from devotion, his 
denial from surprise.” In Peter, therefore, fear and love struggled 
together ; in the first case love overcame fear, but soon afterwards 
under heavy temptation fear overcame love, when through fear of 
the attendants he denied Christ.

PETER IN THE HIGH PRIEST’S PALACE. 


227 


Unto the High Priest's house. That is, Caiaphas’. This is more 
fully stated John xviii. 15. The disciple there mentioned was 
S. John, according to S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius. 
So Jerome (in Epit. Marc.\ and Lyranus, who says that John was 
known to the High Priest from selling him fishes, or because one 
of his kindred was a servant of the High Priest, or because he 
had sold his inheritance to the High Priest (Niceph. L 28). But 
it is more likely that it was not one of the Apostles, because they 
were not known to the High Priest And, moreover, both Christ 
and his Apostles were hated by the High Priest, and would not 
have been admitted into his palace by the servants; more likely 
would have been taken prisoners. Most probably it was one of 
His secret disciples, according to the Syriac version. 

And went in y and sat with the servants. Not into the house 
where Jesus was to be examined, but into the court “He 
approached not the place where Jesus was,” says S. Jerome, “ lest 
he should be suspected, but sat with the servants and warmed 
himself at the fire,” as the other Evangelists state. Peter erred 
from imprudence and rashness, for thrusting himself among the 
servants, and thus exposing himself to the risk of either joining 
with them in reviling Him, or else of suffering imprisonment and 
scourging. He therefore shortly afterwards denied Christ “He 
that loveth danger shall perish therein ” (Ecclus. iii. 26). 

To see the end. Whether Christ would be condemned or not, 
or set Himself free from His peril. If condemned, Peter would 
have taken refuge in flight; if acquitted, he would have dutifully 
returned to Him. 

Ver. 59. But the Chief Priests and all the Council sought false 
witness against fesus f to put Him to death. Here comes in S. John’s 
narrative (xviii 19). 

The High Priest “asked Jesus of His disciples and of His 
doctrine,” as is there said, because, says Euthymius, “ he wished 
to convict Him of introducing strange doctrines, and of stirring 
up sedition.” For it was the duty of the High Priest to inquire 
into heresies and new sects. But Jesus firmly and prudently

replied that He had taught openly, and that those who heard His 
teaching were there present, and though His enemies, could speak 
to it. Let him ask them what He had taught them. For there 
is no surer evidence of innocence and sound teaching than that 
which comes from unfriendly hearers. For had Christ stated His 
own doctrine, they might have urged that through fear of con- 
demnation He had said one thing in the Council and another 
in public “He replied not arrogantly,” says S, Chrysostom, 
“but as confident in the truth.” Whence He says, “Why askest 
thou Me?” Why dost thou insidiously and captiously ask Me, 
thou crafty High Priest, to catch something out of My mouth 
wherewith to accuse and condemn Me ? Thou canst easily learn 
from the common opinion of the people what I taught them. If 
thou knowest it not, thou hast not done thy duty as High Priest 
And if thou wishest to know it now, ask the bystanders, My 
enemies, who have often heard Me. Let them produce, if they 
can, a single untrue or unsound word of Mine. For I know they 
cannot do so in truth. 

But when S. John says “that one of the officers which stood 
by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand,” S. Cyril thinks that 
he was struck with His teaching, and wished to remove this 
impression by striking Him. 

He struck Him on the cheek, as vindicating the honour of the 
High Priest Such a blow, inflicted with a mailed hand, was both 
severe and disgraceful, as appears from the “ sacred countenance ” 
which is religiously preserved at S. Peter’s, and exhibited to the 
people in Passion Week. “What more audacious act?” says S. 
Chrysostom. “ Let the Heaven be horrified, let the earth tremble 
at the patience of Christ and the insolence of His servants.” 
“ Methinks,” says S. Cyril, “ the whole universe would have shud- 
dered had it known what it meant : for the Lord of Glory was 
smitten by the impious hand of a man.” It is a marvel that this 
hand was not at once shrivelled up, nay, that the earth had not 
swallowed the man up alive. But the gentleness and love of 
Christ prevented this, who called him and many of his fellows to

SEEKING FALSE WITNESSES.

repentance (Acts ii. 37). Just as Jeremiah foretold in sorrow, 
or rather in astonishment, “He will give His cheek to him 
that smiteth Him. He will be filled full of reproach” (Lam. 

iii* 3°)- 

Now comes in S. Matthew’s narrative. Finding they could find 
nothing against Him from those who were there, “they sought 
false witnesses,” as despairing of finding true testimony, because 
Christ’s wisdom, truthfulness, and sanctity were fully known to all 
the people. 

That they might deliver Him to death . This was the great end 
for which they sought for false witnesses as a necessary means, 
though the sole end of justice is to condemn only on true evidence, 
and to inflict on false witnesses a correspondent punishment For 
they wished for their own credit not to appear men of violence, 
but impartial judges, and consequently to be proceeding judicially 
against Him, though they were at the same time both judges and 
accusers, against every rule of justice and equity. “They craftily 
devise,” says S. Chrysostom, “the outward form and appearance 
of justice, disguising their craft under the veil of a trial” (Viet. 
Ant. on Mark xiv.). Again, they wished Him to be condemned 
by Pilate, but they knew he would not condemn Him unless the 
crime were proved by witnesses to be deserving of death. The 
Chief Priests therefore seek false witnesses against Jesus, the Author 
of life and Saviour of the world, because, though they knew it not, 
God had decreed to give us, by His death, life both here and 
hereafter. 

Ver. 60. But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , 
yet found they none. “The wicked men found no semblance of 
blame in him,” says Origen, “ though they were many, astute, and 
ingenious, so pure and blameless was the life of Jesus.” For the 
evidence of these witnesses was either false or contradictory, or 
not to the point, so that He could not be proceeded against as 
worthy of death. 

At last came two false witnesses , and said \ This fellaiv said \ / am 
able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days .

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


Christ, indeed, had said this (John ii. 19), in answer to their 
request for a sign that He was sent from God. But they were 
false witnesses, because, though they spake the truth in part, yet 
they perverted His words and meaning. For, first. He did not say 
“I am able to destroy,” but “destroy ye,” i.e, 9 “if ye destroy it” 
Next, S. Mark says they added the words “ made without hands," 
though S. John has nothing of the kind. Next, Christ said not, 
“ I will build it again,” but “ I will raise it up.” In like manner 
they distorted its meaning, for He spake of the temple of His 
Body, in which the fulness of the Godhead dwelt as in a temple, 
as S. John added. For when the Jews asked for a sign, Christ 
gave them the sign of His resurrection. Christ might have 
plainly said, “I will rise again from the dead.” But He chose 
rather to make use of the figure of the temple, because in the 
presence of cavillers He was obliged to speak covertly and sym- 
bolically, and also by speaking thus obscurely to furnish occasion 
for His Passion; for He knew that the Jews, from misunderstand- 
ing this obscure saying, would prosecute Him as guilty of death. 
S. Mark here adds, “But neither so did their testimony agree 
together.” For however boastful these words of Christ seemed to 
be, yet they injured no one, and a capital charge could not be 
founded on them. 

Ver. 62. And the High Priest arose and said, Answerest Thou 
nothing to those things which they witness against Thee t He arose, 
as being indignant that He was silent, and slighted this accusation 
as futile, and confuted it by His silence. Again, he rose up to 
show the heinousness and gravity of the crime brought against 
Christ, as though Christ, in speaking thus, had made light of the 
magnificence and holiness of the temple. 

But Jesus held His peace, 1. Because the charge contained 
nothing worthy of death, and needed not an answer. 2. Because 
He knew that anything He might answer would be turned into a 
charge against Him. 3. Because He was fully preparing Himself 
for the death decreed for Him of the Father, and wished not to 
escape it by self-excuse. 4. The silence of Christ atoned for Adam’s

THE HIGH PRIEST’S ADJURATION. 

excuses (Com. on Mark xiv. apud S. Jer.). Christ was silent, in 
order by His siience to make satisfaction for Adam’s foolish talking. 

Ver. 63. And the High Priest said to Him, 1 adjure Thee by the 
Living God that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son 
of God. I, the High Priest, am the Vicar of God on earth, and 
therefore by the authority of God committed to me, I call God to 
witness, and conjure Thee to answer. Caiaphas here touches the 
essence of the whole matter. Jesus said that He was the Christ, 
sent with supreme power for the salvation of men. The Chief Priests 
pertinaciously denied it He therefore asks the question not for 
information, but in order to condemn Him. For if He said He 
were, they condemned Him to death as a blasphemer ; but if He 
said He were not, he would have replied, Why then didst Thou 
pass Thyself off with the people as Christ the Son of God ? and 
would consequently have condemned Him as a false Prophet, in 
having made Himself equal with God, as the Jews urged against 
Him (John v. 19). For the whole ground of their hatred against 
Him was that He, a man, as it seemed, of low birth, said He was 
Christ and Son of God, preached accordingly without their sanc- 
tion, despised their foolish traditions, and publicly and sharply 
reproved their vices and crimes. 

Ver. 64. Jesus saith unto him. Thou hast said. Meaning thereby, 
I am. Christ candidly and clearly replied that He was Christ, 
both to show reverence to the Divine Name by which He was 
adjured, and to bestow due honour and obedience to the authority 
of the High Priest who adjured Him. Says S. Chrysostom, “ to 
take away from them every excuse,” that they might not be able 
to excuse themselves with men, nor before God in the day of 
judgment, by saying, We asked Jesus judicially in the Council, 
but He was either silent or answered ambiguously, wherefore we 
were not obliged to accept and believe in Him as Christ 1 

Nevertheless I say unto you. Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man 
sitting on the right hand of power. After this time, i.e., in the day 
of judgment. Ye shall see Me then, who how seem to be only the 
Son of Man, to be truly the very Son of God, when I am seated at

the right hand of God, and to be His equal in dignity, majesty, and 
glory. He alludes to Ps. cx. 1. I am He of whom David sang 
of old, “The Lord said unto my Lord,” &c. Christ, moreover, 
not only as God, but as man too, sitteth on the right hand of God, 
as explained in Col. iii. 1. 

The Chief Priests will not strictly and exactly see this in the day 
of judgment, as being reprobates, and not to be blessed with the 
sight of God, but to be cursed with the sight of the devil But 
indirectly and in effect they will see it For they will see such 
great majesty, glory, and splendour, and such a train of angels 
attending Him, that they will not doubt that He is near to God, 
nay, God himself, and the Son of God. For they will then 
experience His omnipotence in glorifying the godly and condemn- 
ing the ungodly, who here have condemned Him as weak and 
feeble. 

And coming in the clouds of Heaven. Alluding to Dan. vil 13. 
Behold here, and wonder at His greatness of mind, who though 
standing in the midst of His enemies, yet threatens them with His 
coming to judgment As though He said, Ye now unjustly con- 
demn Me as a false prophet and false Christ, but that day will 
come when I, who stand at your tribunal, shall be seated as judge. 
Ye condemn Me now to the death of the Cross ; but I, in this very 
same place (for Christ will sit in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which 
is nigh Jerusalem, Joel iil 2), will condemn you to the eternal 
torture of hell-fire, because ye committed on My person this awful 
sacrilege, because ye were the murderers of Christ and of God. 
And surely it will thus be. 

Ver. 65. Then the High Priest rent his clothes , saying ; He hath 
spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses t behold^ 
now ye have heard His blasphemy. The garments of the Jews 
could easily be rent, for they were open at the neck, so as to be 
readily taken on and off. They could therefore easily take hold 
of both sides of the opening, and tear them down to the 
waist (but no farther), in token of grief and indignation. This 
was usual among the heathen, but especially among the Jews, in

grief or when they heard blasphemy against God. (See 2 Kings 
xix. 1.) 

But Caiaphas, being High Priest, tore his garments unlawfully; 
for “he shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes,” Lev. 
xxL 10 : the reasons for which I have there given. But Caiaphas 
rent his garment to arouse their ill-will against Jesus, and to expose 
Him as a blasphemer to general execration. But by this very act 
he signified symbolically that the old law with its priesthood was 
rent away by the death of Christ, and that he also was deprived of 
his Priesthood by Him. So S. Leo (Serm. vi. de Pass.) says, “ He 
did this to increase their anger at what they had heard. But not 
knowing the meaning of his mad act, he deprived himself of the 
honour of the Priesthood in forgetfulness of the precept, ‘He 
shall not take off his head-dress, nor rend his clothes.’” And 
Origen says, “He rent his garments, displaying his filthiness and 
the nakedness of his soul, and showing forth in mystery that the 
old Priesthood was to be rent away, and its school of Priests, and 
its training, which was according to the letter.” And Jerome, “He 
rent his garments to show that the Jews had lost the glory of the 
Priesthood, and that the seats of the High Priests were empty.” 
So, too, S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius, Jansen, Barradius, 
and others. 

He hath spoken blasphemy , in saying He was the Messiah and 
Son of God. The High Priest, for fear any one should be in- 
fluenced by the words of Christ, anticipates it by fastening on 
Him the charge of blasphemy, to keep any one from speaking 
in His behalf, and to compel them all to condemn Him as a 
blasphemer. 

What need we any further witness t Caiaphas here displays his 
wickedness, in not acting as a judge, but as a prosecutor and 
accuser of Christ. (See S. Chrysostom.) 

What think ye l Here again he acts the part of a prosecutor and 
not of a judge, makes the very enemies of Christ His judges, and 
by his pontifical authority, and his sentence already decided on, 
drives them, as it were, to condemn Him as a malefactor. “ The

same persons,” says S. Chrysostom, “ bring the charge, discuss it, 
and pass sentence.” 

But they answered and said \ He is guilty of death. Blasphemers 
were stoned (Lev. xxiv. 16), as S. Stephen was stoned. But they 
cried out that He was guilty, not of stoning, but of death. For 
they had already decided to crucify Him. Origen touchingly sets 
forth the indignity of this most iniquitous sentence. “ How great 
an error was it to declare the Prince of Life Himself guilty of 
death, and not, on the testimony of so many who had risen, to look 
on Him as the Fount of Life, from whom life flowed forth on all 
living! For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given 
to the Son to have life in Himself.” What greater indignity than 
that the Son of God, the source of all life to angels, men, and all 
living things, should be condemned by the whole Council as guilty 
of death for having, when asked and adjured by the High Priest, 
confessed that He was the Son of God ? 

He had restored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, life to the 
dead, and is therefore condemned to death by the envious priests. 
But they said in ignorance (but in another sense), that though 
Christ was in Himself most innocent and holy, yet He had taken 
on Himself to atone for our sins. And on that account He was 
guilty of death. For Christ took on Himself the sentence passed 
on Adam and his posterity, “ In the day thou eatest thereof,” &c. 
(Gen. ii. 17). For He wished to atone for our death, that by His 
death He might restore us to the eternal life of grace and glory. 
And accordingly He took on Himself this most undeserved sen- 
tence with the greatest calmness, equanimity, and patience, and 
surrendered Himself to God the Father as a victim for our sins (see 
Isa. liii.), to teach us to bear contentedly (after His example, and 
for love of Him) the unjust judgments, the reproaches and censures 
of men, in order to make the best return to Him we can ; while in 
His service we are treated as guilty of death, just as He was, by the 
whole Council, judged and proclaimed guilty of death for our sakes.

Him (see Heb. vi. 6). Whence S. Bridget (Rev. i. 37) tells us 
that the Blessed Virgin said to her, “I complain that my Son 
is crucified more cruelly by His enemies in the world now, than 
He was by the Jews. For the sins with which they spiritually 
crucify my Son are more abominable and grievous than the sins 
of those who crucified Him in the body.” Some suppose that this 
Council was held early the next day, and that everything here 
recorded by S. Matthew from ver. 59 is spoken by anticipation, and 
ought to come after the first verse of the next chapter (see S. Aug. 
de Cons. Evan. iii. 7, &c.). Others maintain, more correctly, that 
these events were recorded by S. Matthew in due order, and that 
they took place immediately after midnight For there were two 
Councils held, one at night, the one here mentioned, the second 
next morning (Luke xxii. 66). For as all the Council were not 
present at night, Caiaphas summoned a general assembly in the 
morning, to which he convened them all In this Christ was 
condemned unanimously as guilty of treason, not only against 
Divine law in calling Himself the Son of God, but against human 
law also, in asserting that He was a King, and was given up to 
Pilate to sentence Him to crucifixion. The great Council (the 
Sanhedrim) was held in the morning. 

Ver. 67. Then they spat on His face. Great and brutal was the 
barbarity of the servants, as also of the Chief Priests and the 
Councillors who permitted it But they considered they did rightly, 
in vindicating their law and the honour of God, since Christ had 
been already condemned to death as a blasphemer. Those who 
held Him, and the other bystanders as well, and some, too, of the 
Council (as S. Mark implies), spat upon Him. 

On that Divine face, worthy of reverence and adoration from 
all creatures, on which the angels desire to look. This was an 
atrocious insult inflicted by the vilest men on Christ the Son 
of God, who here exhibited stupendous gentleness, humility, 
and patience, and fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah (ii. 6), “I 
gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that 
pluck off the hair.” Whence Forerius says that the plucking of

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVI. 


the beard was a great pain and insult, like spitting in the face. 
Whence S. Clement Alex {Pad. iii. 3) says ‘‘it is a monstrous 
thing to pluck off the hair, which is man’s natural beauty.” 

Whence Euthymius says, “Shudder, ye heavens and earth, and 
all creation; for what face was it on which they inflicted such 
insults?” And so S. Chrysostom, and Titus Bostrensis after 
him, “They spat on that face which the waves of the sea 
feared, on seeing which on the Cross the sun hid his rays; they 
smote it, fully satisfying their anger, inflicting the most insulting 
wounds, thrusting their hands into His (ace, &c. But why 
did they beat Him when they were about to kill Him? What 
need was there for such insults? But their cruelty was manifest 
in all they did, like hunters who vent their rage on the prey 
they have at length found, counting it a pleasure and festive 
sport, and showing how eager they were for cruelty.” 

S. Anselm {de Pass. Horn.) introduces the Blessed Virgin as 
thus saying, “After a little while my Son appeared covered 
with spittle as with leprosy ; ” and speaking of His scourging says, 
“My Son was so benumbed and disfigured, that He appeared 
as though struck with leprosy.” 

They buffeted Him. A buffet {colaphus) is a blow struck with 
the fist on the neck or head; a blow ( alapa ) is given with the 
flat of the hand on the cheek, inflicting greater insult, but less 
pain than the blow {colaphus). 

But others struck Him in the face with their hands. Some 
translate as a rod or a slipper. But here, by a misuse of 
words, it means “a blow.” Christ is therefore here accused as 
impious, — struck with the hand, as impudent ; speaks as the Lord, 
is silent as innocent ; is condemned as sacrilegious ; is smitten 
with fists, “though He measures out the waters with the hollow 
of His hand” (Isa. xl.). His countenance, the brightness of His 
Father’s glory, is disfigured with blows. His eyes are veiled who 
lays bare the secrets of the hearts and looks into all thoughts. 
He is insulted, beaten, and assailed with scoffs, and has His hair 
torn out.

ORACLES OF THE SIBYLS. 


237 


Ver. 68. Prophesy unto vs, thou Christ, Who is he that smote 
Theet They jest at Him for saying He was a Prophet If Thou 
art a Prophet, prophesy to us. They seem to have said this 
insultingly, after they had covered His face. If Thou art the 
Christ, Thou canst not be ignorant of what is hid from Thee. 
Tell us who smote Thee? They jested at Him as a pretended 
soothsayer. “The King of Prophets,” says Theophylact gravely, 
“ is jested at as a false Prophet.” “ They insultingly covered His 
face, so as to make mock of Him, and next that they might not 
be deterred from beating Him by His Divine countenance,” says 
Jansen. “For His majesty beamed forth in His countenance,” 
says S. Jerome. 

Mystically: Christ when veiled signified that He hid His face 
from the Jews, who were deprived of faith and the knowledge of 
God. Just as Moses, a type of Christ, when he veiled his eyes on 
coming down from the Mount, signified the same thing (2 Cor. iii. 13). 
In his own words, “ I will hide my face from them ” (Deut xxxii. 20). 

Tropologically : it signifies that He atoned for Adam and Eve’s 
sin, for they sinned both with their eyes and their mouths, in 
looking at and then eating the forbidden fruit Christ there- 
fore, to expiate this sin, suffered His mouth and eyes to be 
covered. For, as S. Augustine says, “Christ suffered in all the 
members in which man has sinned, that He might expiate all.” 

Christ, moreover, endured all these sufferings with steadfast 
patience. “As He,” says S. Chrysostom, “omitted no act of 
gentleness, so did they omit no act of insult or impiety, but 
sought to glut their rage both in word and deed.” 

The Delphic Sibyl thus foretold — 

“ Then impious Israel 
Will buffet Him, and from their sinful lips 
Will pour their poisonous spittle, 

And will give, for food the gall, and vinegar to drink,” && 

And the Erythraean Sibyl (Lad. iv. 18) — 

“The innocent will give His back to blows,” && 

The reason for these insults was — First, That Christ should

thus expiate the infinite sins with which men (so far as they 
can) inflict the greatest injuries on God. For the sinner, so far 
as he can, spits upon God, buffets and beats Him, because he 
despises Him, and esteems Him less than the creature which 
he loves. So Origen, “He suffered all these indignities to save 
us who deserved them all” “ His reproaches took away our 
reproach,” Pseudo-Jerome on S. Mark. “It was not Christ that 
suffered, but we suffered in Him,” says S. Athanasius. Christ 
wished to endure all these dire sufferings in order to honour 
God the more, and to make the greater satisfaction for the 
wrong done Him. His Passion therefore honoured God more 
than Adam’s sin dishonoured Him. Add to this, that wicked 
men insult God, and invent fresh ways of insulting Him. Christ 
therefore willed to be insulted, and to expiate their newly-devised 
sins by His newly-devised insults. 

Secondly, to set forth the highest pattern of patience and 
virtue. If any one, therefore, desires a specimen of the greatest 
humility, gentleness, obedience, patience, constancy, charity, let 
him look on Christ suffering and crucified, and imitate Him as 
far as he can. “According to the pattern I showed to thee 
in the Mount” of Calvary (Exod. xxv. 40). “Wondrous is Thy 
Passion, O Lord Jesus,” says S. Bernard (Wednesday in Holy 
Week), “ which hath driven away all our sufferings, makes propitiar 
tion for all our iniquities, and is never found ineffectual in all 
our diseases. For what is so deadly as not to be healed by Thy 
death? In this Passion, then, three things we must specially 
look at : the act, the mode, the cause ; for in the act, patience ; 
in the mode, humility; in the cause, charity, — is specially com- 
mended to us.” 

Thirdly, to animate the martyr to endure every kind of tor- 
ment, and the faithful to bear any injuries, by whomsoever im- 
posed. “ He endured them all with great courage, teaching us to 
bear injuries,” says Euthymius, deriving from Christ adamantine 
hardness ; as Isaiah (L 7) says, “ I have set my face as a flint, 
and 1 know that I shall not be confounded. He is near that

justifieth me; who will contend with me?” For as iron is 
hardened the more it is struck with the hammers, and is so far 
from being broken by them that it breaks them itself; so let us, 
the more we are afflicted, exhibit the greater courage, and thus 
by our patience overcome the hatred of our adversaries (see 
Ezek. iiL 9). Again, as iron breaks iron, so do the patient 
overcome the obstinate wickedness of the ungodly, of whom 
Zecharias says (vii. 12), "They made their hearts as adamant, 
lest they should hear the law.” "For nothing is so hard as not 
to be surpassed by something harder,” says S. Bernard. More- 
over, S. Athanasius says (de Cruce\ "Just as when a man strikes 
a stone with his hand, he does not break the stone, but hurts 
his hand; so they who strove against the Lord, as contending 
against incorruption, were corrupted, and as plotting against the 
Immortal, themselves perished.” 

And so the Jews, for these insults offered to Christ, were 
rejected by God, and exposed to universal reprobation. "They 
received,” says Origen, "a lasting blow, and lost all their Pro- 
phets; whereas God exalted Jesus, who humbled Himself even 
unto death, and gave Him a name which is above every name.” 

After Caiaphas had with the whole Council proclaimed Christ 
to be guilty of death, the servants of the High Priest and some 
of the Council insulted Him for three whole hours, while the 
others lay down to rest, to be ready to proceed with the case in 
the morning. 

Indeed, He was subjected all the night through to cruel injuries, 
and bore them all with sweetness and fortitude. 

S. Bernard (Serm. xliii. in Cant . L 12), on the words, "My 
beloved is as a bundle of myrrh/ wisely and piously observes, 
"He made up this bundle from the reproaches and insults of 
these attendants,” and adds, "This healthful posy is preserved 
for me ; no one shall take it from me. It shall lie between my 
breasts. These I said meditated wisdom; in these I established 
the perfections of my righteousness, in these the fulness of 
wisdom, in these the riches of salvation, in these abundance of

merits. From these there came to me one while the heathful 
draught of bitterness, at another the sweet ointment of consola- 
tion. They sustain me in adversity, those check me in prosperity j 
and amidst the joys and sorrows of this present life they afford 
me safe guidance on either side as I walk along the royal road, 
and ward off imminent dangers on both sides.” 

Ver. 69. Now Peter sat without in the hall: and a damsel 
came unto Him, saying, And thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
S. Matthew here goes back to the history of S. Peter, whom he 
speaks of (ver. 58) a? having followed Jesus into the hall; and 
he here brings together in one S. Peter's three denials, though 
they took place at different times. He sat at the fire warming 
himself. S. John says he stood; but this with the Jews merely 
meant that he was present, not any particular attitude He stood, 
it may be, at one time, and sat at another. 

But if he stood without, how was it that he was within the 
house? He was within, as being in the outer court, but without 
with respect to the inner court. Whence S. Ambrose says (Luke 
xxii.), “Where was it that Peter denied Christ? In the prae- 
torium of the Jews, in the company of the wicked.” And Bede, 
too, on Mark xiv., “How hurtful is converse with the wicked! 
Peter amongst the servants of the High Priest said he knew not 
the man, though among the disciples he had confessed Him to 
be God.” 

A damsel One of inferior degree, “a doorkeeper,” says S. 
John. Hence we see more clearly the weakness and fear of 
Peter, who was staggered by the question of a humble damsel, 
and denied Christ ; though afterwards, when he had received the 
Spirit, feared not Caiaphas, or the whole Council, when he said, 
“We must obey God rather than men” (Acts iv.). Learn from 
this how weak is man when over-confident in himself and for- 
saken of God; and, on the other hand, how bold, if he distrusts 
himself and trusts in God. “Peter without the Spirit was over- 
come by the words of the damsel, but with the Spirit he yielded 
neither to rulers nor kings” ( Com. on S. Mark, apud S. Jerome).

Peter's deceit. 


24 1 


But how did this damsel recognise Peter before all the men 
who had seen him in the garden with Christ? Because, as the 
doorkeeper, she carefully noticed those who went in and out 
And she observed that Peter was not one of the servants, but 
a stranger, and with an agitated look, and hence conjectured 
he was a follower of Jesus. For sagacious doorkeepers are 
quick in detecting, for it is difficult to conceal the feelings, and 
not to betray them by the look. Perhaps, also, she had seen 
Peter with the other Apostles, and had carefully noted his 
appearance. 

Of Galilee, For Jesus was of Nazareth in Galilee, and he 
calls him a Galilean, both as despised by the Jews, who thought 
that no Prophets came from thence (John vii. 62), and 
also as a seditious person, a follower of Judas of Galilee (Acts 

Ver. 70. But he denied before them ally sayings 1 knoiv not 
what thou sayest. Fearihg he would be seized, and to obtain 
belief for his denial, he said that her question was so strange 
that he knew not what it meant. “I am so far from knowing 
who Jesus is, that I know not what it is you ask. For I know 
not whether He has disciples, or who and what they are” It 
was a lie ; just as when a person, if asked by Pagans whether he 
is a Christian, says he is not This is a sin against the pro- 
fession of the faith, of which Peter had heard Christ's warnings and 
threatenings (Matt. x. 33). “But Peter,” says Victor of Antioch, 
“was in such consternation and agitation of mind as entirely to 
forget the Lord's threatening.” And hence S. Augustine (on John 
xviiL 65), commiserating his fall, exclaims, “Behold this most 
firm pillar tumbled at one single breath of air! Where is now 
that boldness of promising, that over - confidence in himself? 
Where are his words, ‘If I should die with Thee, I will not 
deny Thee'? But what marvel if God's prediction proved true, 
and man's presumption false?” 

Denied . How many times? Dionys. Carthus. says six times, 

thrice in the house of Annas. S. John implies, thrice in the

house of Caiaphas, as the other Evangelists expressly state (see 
S. Aug. de Cons. Evang. iii. 6). Cajetan (on John xviiL) says 
seven times, thrice when addressed by women, and four times by 
men. 

But the common opinion is that he denied only thrice. See 
S. Cyril on John xviii. ; S. Ambrose (Luke xxii.), and others. 
And this is clear from S. Matthew’s narrative, who sets foith the 
history succinctly, and in the best order. 

The Evangelists relate his threefold denials in different ways. 
But in order to reconcile them, observe that Peter first simply 
denied in the hall, when asked by the first damsel, next with 
an oath, when asked by the second, and thirdly, with cursing 
and swearing. 

Here observe that S. Hilary on this passage, and S. Ambrose 
on Luke xxii., seem to say that Pete: in denying Christ did not 
lie, but spoke ambiguously. For he said he knew not the man, 
because he knew Him to be God. “ I was not with Him whom 
ye call a man, but I withdrew not from the Son of God,” says 
S. Ambrose. I know not what thou sayest, — that is, I understand 
not your profanity. But S. . Jerome tacitly refutes them, as Christ 
does also by saying, “Thou shalt thrice deny Me.” But SS. 
Hilary and Ambrose can both be excused, because they merely 
meant to say that Peter’s words were so measured that a sound 
meaning could be elicited from them, that he spoke so ambiguously 
that his words of denial could be turned into a good meaning. 

1. It is certain, therefore, that Peter sinned mortally. So S. Chry- 
sostom here, and S. Augustine ( Tract, cxiii on John). He therefore 
lost by his denial the grace and love of God. But whether he 
lost his faith is doubtful. But if any one of the Apostles retained 
his faith it was Peter (see above, ver. 31), especially as he soon 
afterwards repented, and wept bitterly for his sin of denial. He 
therefore mentally retained his faith, which moved him to 
repentance and tears. 2. He was to fall thus gravely for three 
reasons. First (which is the source of all), from over-confidence ; 
next, because, though conscious of his weakness, he threw himself

ONE SIN LEADS TO OTHERS.

into the company of the wicked men who had seized Jesus; 
and lastly, that he, the future head of the Church, might learn 
to have compassion for the fallen, and set a pattern of true peni- 
tence to all sinners. So S. Chrysostom, S. Leo (Serm. ix. de Pass.), 
S. Gregory {Horn, xxi.), and others. 

The first denial took place just after midnight He went away 
for fear the damsel should question him again. 

And the cock crew. This first cock-crowing did not rouse Peter 
from his fall, nor keep him from falling again. 

Ver. 71. But as he was going out into the porch, another maid 
saw him, and said to them that were there. This jellow was also with 
Jesus of Nazareth. “ It is clear,” says S. Augustine (de Cons. 
Evang. iil 6), “ by comparing the testimony of all the Evangelists, 
that Peter did not deny in front of the gate, but within it, in the 
hall by the fire. S. Matthew and S. Mark mention his going, but 
for brevity’s sake do not mention his return.” 

Ver. 72. And immediately he denied with an oath, I know not the 
man. It appears from S. Luke and S. John that several others 
put the same question, and pressed him hard. On which Peter, 
finding that a stronger answer was required, added an oath, ue., 
committed perjury; for, as S. Gregory says, “a sin which is not 
blotted out by repentance, by its very weight quickly draws on to 
another,” both because it weighs down, depresses, and weakens 
the conscience, and also because the sinner thinks that as he 
has sinned, it is of little moment if he falls again into the like 
sin. Some Christians when they have once fallen into fornication 
or gluttony repeat the sin, as thinking, “We have already fallen, 
let us fall again, and then by the same confession we shall blot 
out all our sins together.” But they are wrong ; for a second is a 
new offence against God, and inflicts on the soul a new wound 
more deadly than the first; for repentance is more difficult after 
repeated sin than after the first fall. “ Perseverance in sin causes 
increase of guilt,” says Rabanus. His intercourse with the ungodly, 
which he ought to have given up after his first fall, drove 
Peter to this, though, assuredly, he never should have done it,

as having experienced its noxiousness and his weakness in their 
company. 

Ver. 73. And after a while came unto him they that stood by and 
said unto him, Surely thou art one of them, for thy speech bewrayeth 
thee. 

Ver. 74. Then began he to curse and sivcar, saying, I know not 
the man. The servants who were watching the trial at the door 
after a while returned to the fire, and turning to Peter, tempted 
him again, and forced him to his third denial. They gave 
their reason, “Thy speech bewrayeth thee;” from his Galilean 
dialect S. John adds (xviii. 26) a further charge, for a kinsman 
of Malchus said, “Did I not see thee in the garden with Him?” 
Peter, therefore, finding himself driven to extremities, “began to 
curse and swear” that he knew not the man, saying, after the 
Hebrew manner, May God do these things to me if I know 
Him. May the earth open, may the lightning blast me, if I 
know Him. The Greek word is xaraxiQtfiarfytp, to anathematise 
vehemently, to call curses down on oneself. “The more they 
urge and insist upon it, the more vehemently does he swear, the 
more obstinately does he act,” says Victor of Antioch on Mark 
xiv. “Consider here,” says S. Cyril (Ltb. xii. on John), “what 
the Apostles were before the coming of the Holy Spirit, and what 
they were made afterwards, when endued with power from on 
high.” 

And immediately the cock cnw. To remind Peter of Christ’s 
prediction, and to move him to repentance. S. Luke adds, “ And 
the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,” &c. This look, then, as 
S. Ambrose teaches, caused Peter, who had not noticed the first 
cock-crowing, to notice this, to call to mind his warning, and to 
begin to repent and weep. “ Christ looked on Peter,” says S. Leo, 
“and then raised him up.” He looked on him also with the eyes 
of His mind, putting before him the baseness of his denial, and 
urging him on to repentance (S. Augustine, Bede, Ambrose, and 
others). And with His bodily eyes also, because Christ, after 
being pronounced guilty of death, seems to have been brought

down to the outer hall, which was below, and where Peter was; 
and there turning to him, and smiting him with His gracious 
look, He reminded him of his fall, and recalled him to himself 
Christ seems to have been brought down to this hall that, while 
the Priests were taking a little rest, He might be handed over to 
the custody and insolence of their attendants. Or Christ certainly 
from the inner hall saw Peter standing in the outer one, Christ’s 
overruling providence so ordering everything, that a fit oppor- 
tunity was afforded for looking on Peter. 

Here admire alike the loftiness and the charity of Christ. For 
though already condemned to death, and in the midst of His 
insults and blows, He seemed as it were to forget Himself, and to 
care for Peter, to bring him back as a lost sheep into the path of 
safety, and teach us to do the like. It was so with S. Chrysostom, 
who, when driven into exile, and even to death, seemed to forget 
himself, and wrote most affectionate letters to his friends; and 
exhorts Constantius, his presbyter, not to be downcast at his per- 
secution, but to rouse himself, and send apostolic men to convert 
Phoenicia, and write him an account of their proceedings. For the 
energy and courage of the helmsman is exhibited in the storm, as 
that of a soldier in fight, a general in the field, a physician in the 
paroxysm of a disease. S. Leo (. Serm . iii. de Pass.) observes, “The 
Lord looked on Peter, and though exposed to the revilings of the 
Priests, the falsehoods of the witnesses, and the insults of those 
who smote and spat upon Him, He met His troubled disciple with 
those eyes wherewith He foresaw he would be troubled. And the 
glance of truth was turned on him in whom amendment of heart 
was to be wrought, as though the voice of the Lord sounded 
within him, and said, What doest thou, Peter? Why dost thou 
withdraw into thine own conscience? Turn to Me, trust in Me, 
follow Me; this is the time of My passion, the hour of thy 
punishment has not yet arrived. Why fearest thou that which 
thou also wilt overcome? Let not the weakness I have taken 
upon Me perplex thee; I was trembling for thy fate, be not 
thou anxious for Mine.” And therefore “ it was impossible,” says

S. Jerome, “that he should remain in the darkness of denial, 
since the Light of the World had looked upon him.” 

Ver. 75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He sat'd. 
Before the cock crow twice (S. Mark adds), thou shalt deny Me thrice. 
And he went out and wept bitterly . “ After the herald of day cried 

to him,” says Origen, “ he remembered.” And Victor of Antioch 
on Mark xiv. says, “ He was admonished by the cock crowing, 
and, as if aroused from deep sleep and brought back again to 
himself, he remembered that he had fallen into that very sin and 
disgrace which the Lord had foretold.” 

Symbolically: a cock. Our own conscience is given to rs by 
God, which cries out against us as oft as we sin, and says, Why 
committest thou this great sin ? Why dost thou offend God ? Why 
dost thou hurt thyself, and expose thyself to the peril of hell? 
This cry wounds the conscience, and stimulates it to repentance; 
and whoso hears and regards it feels true compunction with S. 
Peter, and does away his sin by penitence. So Laur, Justin de 
Christi agone , cap . ix. So, too, S. Gregory (Mor, xxx. 4), explaining 

Job xxxviil 36 (Vulg.), “Who hath given the cock understanding?” 

And he went out Because he could not weep before the Jews, 
lest he should betray himself ; and because the very sight of them 
was the cause of his denying Christ As he was penitent, this 
ground for falling away had to be removed. He goes forth, there- 
fore, and gives full vent to his tears. “For he could not,” says 
S. Jerome, “manifest his repentance when sitting in the hall of 
Caiaphas ; he therefore goes away from the council of the wicked 
to wash away the filth of his cowardly denial with the tears of 
love.” 

Calvin objects, that this was but a halting repentance, because 
he did not confess his sin before the Jews, in whose presence he had 
denied Christ, and thus do away with the scandal he had caused 
them. I reply, that he had not given them any scandal so as to 
strengthen them in their hatred of Christ, for they were already 
most determined in their hatred of Him. And if he had retracted 
his denial in their presence, it would have been without any

benefit, nay, with hurt both to himself and them. For he would 
have exposed himself to the risk of relapse, and them to the peril 
of feeling greater indignation against Christ ; and they would then 
have punished more severely both himself and Christ 

Wept bitterly. He wept with bitter tears (in the Arabic), as 
though his great sorrow had embittered his heart, so as to shed 
bitter tears in satisfaction for his sin. “For” (as S. Bernard says) 
“the tears of penitents are the wine of angels” — nay, of God 
and Christ Hear S. Ambrose (in Luc. xxii.), “Why wept he? 
Because his sin came into his mind. Peter grieved and wept 
because he had erred as a man. To fall is a common thing, to 
repent is of faith. But why did he not pray rather than weep?” 
He answers, “Tears wash away the sin which the voice is 
ashamed to confess. Tears do not ask for pardon, they merit it 
I know why Peter kept silence. It was because an earlier request 
for pardon would have added to his offence. We must weep 
first, and then pray.” And shortly after he says, “Teach us, O 
Peter, what did thy tears profit thee! Thou hast taught us 
already. For thou didst fall before thou wept But after thy tears 
thou wast raised up to rule others, though before thou couldest 
not rule thyself.” 

Thou wilt say that S. Ambrose remarks in the same passage, 
“ I read of the tears of Peter, but not of his satisfaction.” These 
words the Calvinists pervert, as doing away with works of satis- 
faction, and destroying their efficacy. But ignorantly and foolishly. 
For S. Ambrose means by “ satisfaction ” excuses for sin, as appears 
from what follows. “ I read that Peter lamented his sin, and did 
not excuse it, as guilty men are wont to da” But Peter confessed 
his sin with loving tears. And there is no question among the 
orthodox that such works are satisfactory. 

S. Clement, the disciple and successor of S. Peter, records that 
Peter was so penitent, as his whole life afterwards to fall on his 
knees when he heard the cock crow, shed bitter tears, and ask 
pardon again of God and Christ for his sin, long since forgiven. 
His eyes also gave evidence of this, being bloodshot from constant

weeping (Niceph. ii. 37). And lastly, Peter compensated for hts 
fall by living to his death an austere life, feeding on lupins 
(S. Gregory Naz. de A more pauperum ), and also by his unwearied 
labours as an apostle, his persecutions, his sorrows, and, finally, his 
death on the cross, which he most resolutely and joyfully under- 
went for Christ’s sake. 

S. Bridget records (Rev. iii. 5) that S. Peter appeared to her, 
and stated that the cause of his fall was his forgetfulness of his 
own resolution and the promise he made to Christ And he thence 
suggests this remedy for temptation, “ Rise up by humility to the 
Lord of Memory, and seek for memory from Him.”

CHAPTER XXVII. 

X Christ is delivered bound to Pilate . 3 Judas hangeth himself. 19 Pilate , 

admonished of his wife , 24 washeth his hands: 26 and looseth Barabbas. 
29 Christ is crowned with thorns , 34 crucified , 40 reviled , 50 dieth, and is 
buried : 66 his sepulchre is sealed , and watched. 

flT HEN the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people 
* * took counsel against Jesus to put him to death : 

2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to 
Pontius Pilate the governor. 

3 IT Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was con- 
demned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the 
chief priests and elders, 

4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And 
they said, What is that to us ? see thou to that. 

5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went 
and hanged himself. 

6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said. It is not lawful for 
to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. 

7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury 
strangers in. 

8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 

9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying. 
And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom 
they of the children of Israel did value ; 

10 And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me. 

11 And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him, saying, 
Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 

12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered 
nothing. 

13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness 
against thee ? 

14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor 
marvelled greatly. 

15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a 
prisoner, whom the)' would. 

16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom 
will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ ? 

18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 

19 IF When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, 
saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many 
things this day in a dream because of him. 

20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should 
ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 

21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye 
that I release unto you ? They said, Barabbas. 

22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called 
Christ ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. 

23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done ? But they cried out 
the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 

24 IF When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult 
was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, 
I am innocent of the blood of this just persop : see ye to it. 

25 Then answered all the people, and said. His blood be on us, and on our 
children. 

26 IT Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged 
Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. 

27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and 
gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. 

28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 

29 II And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his 
head, and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him, and 
mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews ! 

30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. 

31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and 
put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. 

32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name : him 
they compelled to bear his cross. 

33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a 
place of a skull, 

34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had 
tasted thereof he would not drink. 

35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots; that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments 
among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 

36 And sitting down they watched him there ; 

37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE 
KING OF THE JEWS. 

38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, 
and another on the left 

39 f And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 

40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 
save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 

41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders* 
said.

42 He saved others ; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, 
let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 

43 He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now, if he will have him : for he 
said, I am the Son of God. 

44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. 

45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the 
ninth hour. 

46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, 
lama sabachthani ? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ? 

47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard Mat, said, This man 
calleth for Elias. 

48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with 
vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 

49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. 

50 H Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 

51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the 
bottom ; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent ; 

52 And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept 
arose, 

53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy 
city, and appeared unto many. 

54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, 
saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, 
saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 

55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus 
from Galilee ministering unto him. 

56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and 
Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children. 

57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathxa, named 
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus* disciple ; 

58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate com- 
manded the body to be delivered. 

59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen 
cloth, 

60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock : and 
he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. 

61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary sitting over against 
the sepulchre. 

62 IT Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief 
priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 

63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, 
After three days I will rise again. 

64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, 
lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, 
He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first. 

65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch : go your way, make it as sure as 
ye can. 

66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting 
a watch.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


Ver. i. But when the morning was come (Syr. when it was 
dawn), all the chief priests, &c. “See here,” says S. Jerome, “the 
eagerness of the Priests for evil,” their feet were swift to shed 
blood (Ps. xiv. 6). They were urged on by their bitter hatred of 
Christ, and by Satan’s instigatioa It was the morning of Friday, 
only a few hours before His crucifixion, when Caiaphas, who had 
already tried and condemned Him the night before, summoned 
thus early the great Council of the Sanhedrim. It was to obtain 
His condemnation by the whole Body, which would ensure the 
subsequent condemnation by Pilate. S. Matthew omits the pro- 
ceedings of this Council, as being a mere repetition of what he 
had already recorded (chap. xxvi. 59 seq.). But the narrative is 
supplied by S. Luke (xxii. 26 seq.), as explained above (see ver. 59). 

S. Leo says strikingly, “This morning, O Jews, destroyed your 
Temple and altars, took away from you the Law and the Prophets, 
deprived you of your kingdom and priesthood, and turned all your 
feasts into unending woe” (Serm. iii. de Pass.). 

To put Him to death. That is, how they could do it without 
hindrance or tumult, and also by what kind of death, as, e.g., that 
of the Cross, the most ignominious of all. Some members of the 
Council were probably Christ’s followers and friends; and these 
most likely absented themselves, or were not summoned, or sent 
away elsewhere, for fear they should defend Him. But if any of 
them were present, they either gave sentence in His favour, or were 
forced by the clamour of the rest to remain silent ; as Nicodemus 
and Joseph of Arimathaea (Luke xxiii. 51). Here notice, this 
wicked Council erred not only in fact, but in faith. For it gave 
sentence that Jesus was not the Christ nor the Son of God, but 
that He was guilty of death, as having falsely claimed to be both : 
all which statements are erroneous and heretical. This, however, 
was only a small and particular, not an (Ecumenical Council. 
These latter, as representing the whole Church, have the gift of 
inerrancy by the power of the Holy Ghost and by Christ’s own 
promise. But you will say the whole Jewish Church at that time 
fell away from the faith. It was not so, for many of Christ’s converts

JESUS BOUND. 253 

in Judaea remained steadfast, and there were true believers among 
the Jews who were converted at the day of Pentecost (Acts ii.). 

Ver. 2. And when they had bound Him , they led Him away , and 
delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor ; “ For,” as S. Jerome 

says, “ it was the Jewish custom to bind and deliver to the judge 
those they had condemned to death.” Here then was Samson 
bound by Delilah, Christ by the Synagogue. Origen says truly, 
“They bound Jesus who looseth from bonds; who saith to them 
that are in bonds, 4 Go forth * (Isa. xlix. 9) ; who looseth the fetters, 
and saith, ‘Let us break their bands asunder.*” For Jesus was 
bound that He might set us free by taking on Himself the bonds 
and the punishment of our sins. 

They brought '. Caiaphas, />., and all the other members of the 
Council, to crush by the weight of their authority both Jesus and 
Pilate alike. For if Pilate refused to ratify their sentence, they 
would be able to accuse him of aiming at the sovereignty of 
Judaea, and being thus an enemy of Caesar, and so force him in 
this way, even against his will, to condemn Him to death. 

Delivered to Pontius Pilate. Why? Some think from what is 
said in the Talmud that the Jews were forbidden to put any one 
to death. But see Deut xxi. 23 ; Num. xxv. 4 ; Josh. xiii. 29 ; 2 
Sam. xxi. 6 and 9. 

But the fact was that the Romans had taken away from the Jews 
the power of life and death (John xviii. 31). Ananus was deposed 
from the High-Priesthood for killing James the Lord’s brother 
and others, without the consent of the Roman governor. The 
stoning of S. Stephen was only an outbreak of popular fury. 

There were also other reasons. 1. To remove from themselves 
the discredit of His death, as though it had arisen merely from 
envy. 2. To dishonour Him as much as they could, by getting 
Him condemned by Pilate to the ignominious death of crucifixion, 
the punishment of rebels. They themselves had condemned Him 
of blasphemy, which was punished by stoning (Lev. xxiv. 16). 
3. To dishonour Him the more by causing Him to be put to death 
as a profane person, by one, too, who was himself profaning the

holy feast of the Passover (see S. Chrysostom, Horn, lxxxvi. in 
Matt ; S. Augustine, Tract, cxiv. in John ; and S. Cyril, Lib. xii 
in Joan. cap. 6). 

But a retaliatory punishment was inflicted on the Jews; for as 
they delivered up Christ to Pilate, so were they in turn delivered 
up to be destroyed by Titus and Vespasian (S. Cyril on John, 
cap. xviii. ; Theophylact, and Victorinus on Mark xiv.). 

Vers. 3, 4. Then Judas , which had betrayed Him , when he saw 
that He was condemned , &c. Judas, when he sold Christ, did not 
expect that He would be killed, but merely seized, and either 
render them some satisfaction, or in some way escape, as before, 
out of their hands. But on finding Him condemned to death, he 
felt the gravity of his sin. And repenting, when too late, of what 
he had done, he was self-condemned, and hanged himself. “The 
devil is so crafty,” says S. Chrysostom, “that he allows not a man 
(unless very watchful) to see beforehand the greatness of his sin, 
lest he should repent and shrink from it But as soon as a sin is 
fully completed, he allows him to see it, and thus overwhelms him 
with sorrow and drives him to despair. Judas was unmoved by 
Christ's many warnings ; but when the deed had been wrought, he 
was brought to useless and unavailing repentance.” 

That He was condemned. By Caiaphas, *.&, and the whole 
Council, and that he would shortly be condemned by Pilate on 
their authority, and by their urgent importunity. 

Repented himself. Not with true and genuine repentance, for 
this includes the hope of pardon, which Judas had not ; but with a 
forced, torturing, and despairing repentance, the fruit of an evil 
and remorseful conscience, like the torments of the lost In Gr. 

IMxauLd.rfiui. 

Brought again the thirty pieces oj silver to the Chief Priests . To 
rescind his bargain. As if he had said, “ I give back the money ; 
do ye, on your part, restore Jesus to liberty.” So S. Ambrose (in 
Luc. xxii.), “In pecuniary causes, when the money is paid back, 
justice is satisfied.” And S. Hilary, “ Judas gave back the money 
that he might expose the dishonesty of the purchasers.” And &

Ambrose, “Though the traitor was not absolved himself, yet was 
the impudence of the Jews exposed ; for though put to shame by 
the confession of the traitor, they insisted wickedly on the fulfil- 
ment of the bargain.” 

I have sinned in that / have betrayed the innocent Blood ; Gr. 
; for what more innocent than the immaculate Lamb ? what 
purer than the purity of Jesus Christ? 

But they said , What is that to us l see thou to that . Carry out 
what thou hast begun. Bear the punishment of the guilt thou 
ownest We own no fault in ourselves. But He is guilty of death 
as a false Christ, and therefore we insist on it Now, as they 
refused to take back the money, Judas cast it down in the Temple, 
and hung himself, despairing of the life of Jesus and of his own 
salvation. For assuredly he would not have thus acted had the 
Chief Priests taken the money back and set Jesus free. Up to a 
certain point, then, his repentance was right, but when it drove 
him to despair it was wrong. “See how unwilling they were,” 
says S. Chrysostom, “ to see the audacity of their conduct, which 
greatly aggravated their fault For it was a clear proof that they 
were hurried away by audacious injustice, and would not desist 
from their evil designs, foolishly hiding themselves the while undei 
a cloak of pretended ignorance.” 

And he cast down the pieces of silver in the Temple , and departed^ 
and went and hanged himself He first took them to the house of 
Caiaphas, or certainly to that of Pilate, where the Chief Priests 
were prosecuting their case; and afterwards, on their refusing to 
take them, threw them down in the Temple for the Priests to pick 
up. Some of the Chief Priests were probably there, but anyhow 
by throwing them down in the Temple he devoted them, as the 
price of the Most Holy Blood, to sacred and pious uses, if the 
Priests refused to take them back. 

And he went and hanged himself The Greek writers are mis- 
taken in thinking that he did not die in this way, but was after- 
wards crushed to death (see on Acts i. 18). Judas then added to 
his former sin the further sin of despair. It was not a more

heinous sin, but one more fatal to himself, as thrusting him down 
to the very depths of hell. He might, on his repentance, have 
asked (and surely have obtained) pardon of Christ But, like Cain, 
he despaired of forgiveness, and hung himself on the self-same 
day, just before the death of Christ For he could not bear the 
heavy remorse of an accusing conscience. So S. Leo (Serm. de 
Pass. iii. ; S. Augustine, Quasi . v., and N. Test. xciv.). David 
had prophesied respecting him, “Let a sudden destruction,” &c. 
(Ps. xxxv. 8). Thus S. Leo, “O Judas, thou wast the most wicked 
and miserable of men, for repentance recalled thee not to the Lord, 
but despair drew thee on to thy ruin ! ” And again, “ Why dost 
thou distrust the goodness of Him who repelled thee not from the 
communion of His Body and Blood, and refused thee not the kiss 
of peace when thou earnest to apprehend Him? But thou wast 
past conversion (a spirit that goeth and retumeth not) ; and with 
Satan at thy right hand, thou followedst the mad desire of thy own 
heart, and madest the sin which thou hadst sinned against the King 
of Saints to recoil on thine own head ; that thus, as thy crime was 
too great for ordinary punishment, thou mightest pronounce, and 
also execute, the sentence on thyself. 

Some say that Judas hung himself from a fig-tree, the for- 
bidden tree of Hebrew tradition, and one of ill-omen. Hence 
Juvencus — 

44 Even as his own wild punishment he sought, 

He hung with deadly noose on fig-tree’s height.” 

Now it was avarice that drove Judas to this fate. “Hear ye 
this,” says S. Chrysostom ; “hear it, I say, ye covetous. Ponder it 
in your mind what he suffered. For he both lost his money, and 
committed a crime, and lost his souL Such was the hard tyranny 
of covetousness. He enjoyed not his money, nor this present life, 
nor that which is to come. He lost them all at once, and having 
forfeited the goodwill even of those to whom he betrayed Him, he 
ended by hanging himself.” 

This confession of Judas, then (not in word, but in deed), was a

clear proof of Christ's innocence, and it assuredly ought to have 
kept the Jews from killing Him, if they had only had the smallest 
amount of shame. But their obstinate malice could not be re- 
strained even by this strange portent 
Symbolically: Bede remarks (in Acts i.), “ His punishment was 
a befitting one. The throat which had uttered the word of 
betrayal was throttled by the noose. He who had betrayed the 
Lord of men and angels hung in mid-air, abhorred by Heaven and 
earth, and the bowels which had conceived the crafty treachery 
burst asunder and fell out.” S. Bernard, too ( Serm . viii. in Ps. xc. 
[xci.]), says, “ Judas, that colleague of the powers of the air, burst 
asunder in the air, as though neither the Heaven would receive nor 
the earth endure the betrayer of Him who was true God and man, 
and who came to work salvation in the midst of the earth’ 1 (Ps. 
bcxxiil 12, Vulg.). Again, S. Augustine (Lib. Horn. 1 ., Horn. 
xxviL), “That which he wrought on his own body, this was also 
wrought on his soul. For as they who throttle themselves cause 
death, because the air passes not within them, so do they who 
despair of the forgiveness of God choke themselves by their very 
despair, that the Holy Spirit cannot reach them.” 

But the chief priests said \ It is not lawful for to put them into the 
treasury . Corban is the same as offering. It here signifies the 
treasury into which the offerings were cast. In Arab, the house of 
offerings (see Joseph, de B. J., i. 8). 

Because it is the price of blood. What hypocrisy ! They suffer 
not the price of Christ’s blood to be paid into the treasury, 
whereas they had taken money out of it to procure His betrayal 
and death. 

Ver. 7. And they took counsel , , and bought with them the potters 
field , to bury strangers in. “They saw,” says Origen, “that it was 
most fitting that, as the price of blood, it should be expended on 
the dead and their place of burial.” 

Strangers : for the inhabitants had their own burial-places. And 
God so ordered it that this field should be a standing witness both 

of Judas’ repentance and of Christ’s innocence. “The name,”

says S. Chrysostom, “proclaims their bloody deed with trumpet 
tongue, for had they cast it into the treasury, the circumstances 
would not have been made so clearly known to future generations." 

Symbolically: It was thus signified that the price of Christ’s 
Blood would benefit not Jews only, but strangers, the Gentiles, #>., 
who would hereafter believe on Him. So Hilary, “ It belongs not 
to Israel, but is solely for the use of strangers.” 

Ver. 8 . Wherefore that field was called Aceldama. A Chaldee 
word. The Ethiopic and Persian versions agree as to its meaning. 
Adrichomius (Descr. Jerus . Num. 216) describes the spot, and a 
peculiar property of the soil, that it destroys within a few hours 
the dead bodies which are placed in it, a property which it pre- 
serves even when taken elsewhere. Some of it the Empress 
Helena is said to have taken to Rome, where it forms the Campo 
Santo. “ It still retains,” says Cornelius, “the same property.” 

Tropologically : “The field bought for strangers with Christ’s 
Blood is the Church (S. Chrysostom in loc. ; S. Augustine, Serm. 
cxiv. de Temp .), and particularly the state of * Religious,’ who count 
themselves strangers upon earth, and citizens of Heaven, and of the 
household of God,” &c. See also 1 Pet ii. 1 1, where S. Chrysostom 
says, “Nothing is more blessed than this burial, over which all 
rejoice, both angels and men, and the Lord of angels. For if this 
life is not our life, but our life is hidden, we ought to live here as 
though we were dead.” So S. Paul, CoL iii. 3. It was perhaps 
for this symbolical reason that this soil possessed the remarkable 
property mentioned above. See Comment, on Acts L 18, 19. 

Vers. 9, 10. Then was fulfilled , &c. See on Zech. xi. 12, 13. 

The price of Him that was valued ; Gr. rib r^jj* roD nrifit h 
fiifcu. Christ, who is beyond all price (TheophyL), Whom the 
Chief Priests bought of the sons of Israel, of Judas, i.e., who was 
one of them. (So Titelman and Barradeus.) This is stated to add 
to the ignominy of the transaction, viz., that He was sold not by 
a Gentile, but by an Israelite, and one, too, who was called after 
the Patriarch's eldest son. The plural is here put for the singular. 
Theophylact explains it otherwise, that Christ was valued, or

bought, by the Chief Priests for the thirty pieces. Euthymius 
and others, that this price was put on Christ by those who were of 
the sons of Israel, Israelites. 

The Syriac version has the first person, agreeing with Zechariah, 
•MW /took,” &c. (Zech xi. 13). 

As the Lord appointed me , These words can be taken : 1. As 
the words of Christ speaking by the Prophet, and signifying that 
God would suffer nothing which concerned Him to come to 
nought, so that even the field purchased with the price of His 
Blood should not be unoccupied, but serve for the burial of 
strangers. 2. As the words of the Prophet, “ God ordained that I 
should by my own act, as well as by my word, prophesy and fore- 
tell this, and even the goodly price," as he says in irony, “ at which 
Christ should be valued.” 

Ver. 11. But Jesus stood before the Governor . S. Matthew having 
recorded the fate of Judas, now returns to the main narrative, 
omitting, however, several incidents, which are to be found in John 
xviiL 19. It appears from S. Luke xxiii. 2 that the Jews brought 
three definite charges against Jesus — that He was perverting the 
people, that He forbade them to give tribute to Caesar, and main- 
tained that He was Himself a King. Pilate, it would seem, put 
aside the first two as false and malicious, and dwelt only on the 
third. He simply asked Him whether he were the King of the 
Jews, as being of royal descent, or as the promised Messiah, or on 
any other ground. Jesus asked him in reply, “ Sayest thou this of 
thyself?” (John xviii. 34). He knew very well the nature of the 
charge. But he wished to mortify Pilate by suggesting that this 
must be a mere calumny of His enemies, since he who was bound 
to maintain the authority of the Emperor, and had hitherto been 
most vigilant in the matter, had heard nothing of the kind. Pilate 
was irritated, and replied, “Am I a Jew, so as to know or care 
anything about Thy family or descent, or aught else relating to 
Thyself, who art a Jew bom? Thine own nation and the Chief 
Priests have delivered Thee to me. What hast Thou done?" 
This was the very answer which Jesus wished to obtain from him,

and He clearly and directly replied, “ My kingdom is not of this 
world,” &c. (John xviii. 36). 

He explained that it was not to be supported by human agency 
or force of arms (so that Tiberius need not fear that he would 
lose the kingdom of Judaea, but that it was heavenly, spiritual, 
and transcendental, — a kingdom wherein He would reign in the 
hearts of the faithful by grace, and bring them to His kingdom 
in Heaven. S. Matthew, omitting all other points for the sake 
of brevity, assigns this last as the true cause of Christ’s death, 
merely saying, The Governor asked Him , sayings Art Thou the King 
of the Jews f And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. He meant 
by this, I am Messiah the King. He might have said truly, I am 
not the King of the Jews, I am no temporal King, nor do I aim 
at being one. But the Jews understood the title King of the 
Jews to mean the Messiah, and as He could not deny His 
Messiabship, He confessed that He was the King of the Jews, 
the promised Messiah. 

It will be asked, What is the nature of Christ’s kingdom, and 
its manifold relations? Christ, then, as man had a twofold 
kingdom even when on earth. 1. A spiritual kingdom, ie. f His 
Church, which He instituted as a commonwealth of the faithful, and 
founded with certain laws, ordinances, and sacraments. He rules 
it by S. Peter and his successors, as His Vicars, and makes it 
spread through all nations. This kingdom David and the Prophets 
foretold would be given to Christ (S. Aug. Tract cxvil in John). 
a. As S. Thomas (Lib. L de Reg. Trine, cap. xii.) and others 
rightly teach, in opposition to Abulensis [Tostatus] on Matth. xxi., 
it is physical and of this world. For Christ, from His very con- 
ception, had properly and directly dominion over the world, so as 

to depose and appoint kings, though as a fact He did not exercise 
* 

such power on earth. 

Here observe there is a threefold dominion and sovereignty. 
1. The highest of all, which God exercises over all creatures, 
being peculiarly His own. 2. The human authority, which 
earthly kings and princes exercise. 3. Between these two is the

authority of Christ as man, which far surpasses all kingly power: 
x. In its origin, for God gave it to Christ 2. In its stability, for 
it cannot be overcome, and abides for ever. 3. In its object, as 
extending to all created beings, even to angels (see Rev. xix. i6 : 
i. 5; Matt xxviiL 18). This was His, as man, by reason of His 
hypostatic union with the Word or Son of God. And accordingly 
this sovereignty is peculiar to Christ as man, nor has He com- 
municated it to any one, not even to S. Peter and the Pontiffs his 
successors. 

It will be asked whether Christ as man had a human claim 
to the Jewish kingdom? And I say, He had; for He was 
the son, the successor, and heir of David. He did not, it is 
true, enter on His kingdom, nor was He inaugurated as King. 
But yet He furnished an instance of what He was by His 
triumph and entry into Jerusalem. He did not actually enter 

on His kingdom, both because the family of David had long 
ceased to reign, and the kingdom had by common consent passed 
into other hands. 

Ver. 12. And when He was accused of the chief priests and 
elders , He answered nothing . i. Because all the charges against 
Him were false, and deserved not an answer. So S. Augustine 
( Serm . cxviii. de Temp.), “ The Lord by keeping silence does not 
confirm the charge, but makes light of it For far better is that 
cause which is undefended, and yet is successful; that justice is 
most complete which is not supported by words but is based on 
truth. The Saviour, who is Wisdom itself, knew how to conquer 
by silence, to overcome by not replying.” 2. Jesus knew that 
any answer would be useless, and would only make the Jews more 
eager for His death. 3. For fear He should excuse His crime, 
and obtain His deliverance, and so the benefit of His death be 
deferred, says S. Jerome, “for He wished to be condemned 
through keeping silence, and to die for the salvation of men.” 
So S. Ambrose (in Luc. xxii.), “ He rightly keeps silence who 
needs not a defence. Let those who fear defeat be eager for 
defence. But why should He fear who wished not to escape?

He sacrificed His own single life for the salvation of all.” 4. To 
atone thus for all faults of the tongue, and teach men to keep 
their tongues from all evil words. 

Ver. 13. Then saith Pilate unto Him , Nearest Thou not how 
many things they witness against Thee l For Pilate had brought 
Him forth from his house to hear the accusations of the Chief 
Priests, as they would not enter the hall, lest they should be 
defiled (see John xviii. 28). 

Ver. 14. And He answered him to never a word , insomuch that 
the Governor marvelled greatly . Pilate marvelled at His silence in 
this His extreme peril, when assailed by vehement accusations 
and clamour. He marvelled at His gentleness, calmness, and 
contempt of death, and, recognising more fully His innocence 
and holiness, he laboured the more earnestly to deliver Him. 
[Pseudo-]Athan. de Cruce , says, “ It was a marvellous thing that 
our Saviour was so effectual in His persuasion by keeping silence, 
and not by answering, that the judge acknowledged of His own 
accord that it was a mere conspiracy against Him.” And thus do 
the Saints often in like manner refute the false charges against 
them. 

Ver. 15. Now at that feast the Governor was wont to release 
unto the people a prisoner whom they would. There comes in 
before this verse Luke xxii. 5, which records Jesus being sent 
to Herod, Pilate and Herod being reconciled, and His coming 
back again in a gorgeous or white robe. This was the dress of 
candidates for an office, of royal persons, and also of buffoons : 
Herod mocking in this way at the supposed ambition of Jesus in 
affecting to be a king. 

Symbolically : The white garment represented the innocence, 
victory, immortality, glory, &c., of Christ, which He purchased by 
His sufferings and insults. “Let thy garments be always white” 
(Eccles. ix. 8). And so S. Ambrose, “He is arrayed in white, 
in evidence of His immaculate Passion,” and that as the spotless 
Lamb of God He took on Himself the sins of the world. Pilate 
then saw what was Herod’s object in sending Him back, and

said to the Chief Priests (Luke xxiii. 14), “Ye have brought 
this man unto me as one that perverteth the people ... I will 
therefore correct Him, and let Him go,” that is, chastise and 
punish Him, not for His offence (for He is guiltless), but to 
satiate your rage against Him. Shortly afterwards he proposed 
another plan for His deliverance, viz., by releasing some one to 
them at the Passover, having little doubt, if the choice were given 
them, whom they would prefer. This Paschal custom was in- 
troduced in memory of the deliverance from Egypt. But did 
Pilate really wish to release Christ? Rupertus thinks it was 
mere pretence, for that he had secretly agreed with the Jews to 
put Him to death, having given Him up to their will. But S. 
Augustine and the rest suppose, more correctly, that Pilate was 
sincere (see Luke xxiii. 20 and Acts iii. 13). This is clear also 
from the many occasions on which he laboured to save Him (see 
John xviii. 31, 38; Luke xxiii. 7, 15). 

Ver. 16. For he had then a notable prisoner called Bar abbas. 
Notorious, that is, for his crimes. S. John terms him “ a robber.” 
S. Mark and S. Luke, “one who had committed murder in the 
insurrection.” “Notorious,” says S. Chrysostom, “for his bold 
bearing, and stained with many murders.” Now to be thus 
compared with Barabbas, and counted his inferior, was a great dis- 
honour and pain to Christ. And His patience under this wrong is 
a fitting pattern to all Christians when slights are put on them. 

Barabbas. In Hebrew “the Son of a father, of Adam, ie. 9 
the first father of all sinners.” And Christ was made lower than 
Adam when He took on Himself to atone for his disobedience 
and sin. 

S. Jerome explains it less correctly as Barabbas, the son of a 
Master. 

Ver. 17. When therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said 
unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas, or 
Jesus f “That if the Chief Priests wished through envy to 
destroy Him, the people, who had experienced His manifold 
benefits, might ask for His life,” saith Druthmar j or if, as S.

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


Chrysostom says, “they did not wish to pronounce Him innocent, 
they might release Him, though guilty, in consideration of the 
feast" 

Which is called Christ Pilate was in earnest, wishing the Jews 
to demand His deliverance, as being their promised Messiah. 

Ver. 18. For he knew that for envy they had delivered Him. 
From their general bearing and demeanour, and also from his 
own knowledge of His holiness, and teaching, and boldness in 
reproof 

Ver. 19. When he was set down on the judgment seat ', his wife 
sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just 
man : for I have suffered many things this day ( this night) in a 
dream because of Him. This act of Pilate's wife is a fresh effort 
to deliver Him. Her dreams were full of threats against her 
husband and herself, if he condemned Christ Some suppose 
them to have been the work of an evil angel, wishing to prevent 
His death, lest sinners should be saved by Him. ( See the Sermon 
on the Passion, apud S. Cyprian ; S. Bernard, Serm . i. in Pasch.; 
Lyranus , Dionys. Carthus ., Rabanus , and others .) 

Origen, S. Hilary, S. Chrysostom, S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, 
and others more correctly suppose that it was the work of a holy 
angel, and that the dream was sent to Pilate's wife (not himself) : 
1. That both sexes (as well as all the elements afterwards) might 
witness to Christ's innocence. 2. That she might make it 
publicly known by telling her husband. 3. Because she appears 
to have been a noble, tender-hearted, and holy woman. Origen, 
S. Chrysostom, and others consider that she was in this way 
brought to a true belief in Christ S. Augustine (in Aurea 
Catena) says, “that both husband and wife bore witness to 
Christ;” “thus presaging," says S. Jerome, “the faith of the 
Gentiles." And S. Augustine (Serm. cxxL de Temp.), “In the 
beginning of the world the wife leads the husband to death, in 
the Passion she leads him on to salvation." Joanna, too, the wife 
of Chusa, Herod’s steward, was one of those who ministered to 
Christ of their substance.

DREAM OF PILATE'S WIFE. 


26 5 


The Greek Menology terms her Procula; some suggest that 
she was Claudia (2 Tim. iv. 21), as she probably remained at 
Rome when he was banished. S. Augustine implies that she 
converted him ( Serm . iii. de Epifk). “The Magi came from the 
East, Pilate from the West. They accordingly witnessed to Him 
at His birth, he at His death, that they might sit down with 
Abraham, &c., not as their descendants in the flesh, but as grafted 
into them by faith.” Tertullian, too (ApoL cap. xxi.), speaks of 
Pilate as a Christian. 

But all this is at variance with what others say of his banish- 
ment and his self-inflicted death. 

When Pilate then is termed a Christian, it must mean a 
favourer and protector of His innocence. He yielded, it is true, 
at last to the threats of the Jews ; and so it was that by the just 
retribution of God he was himself the victim of the like false 
charge from the Jews, who caused him to be exiled. 

Ver. 20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the 
multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus . The 
Chief Priests used the time which Pilate had given the people for 
consideration in persuading them to ask for Barabbas and destroy 
Jesus, as the most dangerous person of the two. 

Notice here the effect of anger and malice, and the false and 
perverted judgments of the world. Jesus, the author of salvation, 
was to suffer ; btit Barabbas, the murderer, was to be spared. 
But God undoubtedly so ordered it that the Innocent should 
suffer, and thus atone for the guilt of sinners, whom Barabbas 
represented. 

Ver. 21. But the Governor answered and said unto them , Whether 
of the twain will ye that I release unto you l They said \ Barabbas . 
That is, after he had given them time for consideration, he again 
asked them, and demanded an answer. 

Bede (on Mark xv. 9) strikingly remarks, “The demand they 
made still cleaves to them. For as they preferred a robber to 
Jesus, a murderer to the Saviour, the destroyer to the Giver of 
Life, they deservedly lost both their property and their life. They

were reduced, indeed, so low by violence and sedition as to forfeit 
the independence of their country, which they had preferred to 
Christ, and cared not to recover the liberty of body and soul 
which they had bartered away.” 

Allegorically: “ Their choice of Barabbas foreshadowed,” says 
S. Jerome, “that robber Antichrist, whom they would hereafter 
choose in the end of the world.” And S. Ambrose (in Luke xxii.), 
“ Barabbas means the son of a father. They, therefore, to whom 
it was said, ‘Ye are of your father the devil/ are set forth as 
those who would afterwards prefer Antichrist, the son of his 
father, to the true Son of God.” 

Ver. 22. Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with 
Jesus which is called Christ t They all say unto him, Let Him be 
crucified. “Pilate,” says S. Chrysostom, “places the matter in 
their hands, that all might be ascribed to their clemency, thus to 
charm and soften them down by his obsequiousness. But all 
in vain. For the Chief Priests had already resolved to insist on 
His crucifixion, as being not only the most cruel, but also the 
most ignominious of deaths, the death of robbers and other evil- 
doers. For they hoped in this way to destroy all His former 
credit and reputation.” So says S. Chrysostom, “Fearing that 
His memory should be kept in mind, they chose this disgraceful 
death, not knowing that the truth when hindered is more fully 
manifested.” 

Ver. 23. The Governor said. Why , what evil hath He done f But 
they cried out the more (vehemently, irif/Mtf;), saying, Let Him be 
crucified. The more Pilate insisted on His innocence, the more 
did they clamour for His crucifixion, “ not laying aside their anger, 
hatred, and blasphemy, but even adding to them ” (Origen). They 
thus fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah (xii. 11), “Mine heritage 
(the synagogue) is made unto Me as a lion in the forest ; they 
have uttered their voice against Me ; ” and David’s (Ps. xxii. 13), 
“They opened their mouth upon Me, as a ravening and a roaring 
lion;” and Isaiah’s (v. 7), “I looked for judgment, and behold 
iniquity ; and for righteousness, and behold a cry.” (So S. Jerome.)

Pilate's cowardice. 


267 


Ver. 24. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothings but that 
rather a tumult 7 vas made , he took water ; and washed his hands 
bejore the multitude . a*W4-ar#, washed away. “ He adopted,” 

says Origen, “ the Jewish custom, and wished to calm them down, 
not by words only, but also by deed.” He washed his hands, 
but not his conscience. But this took place after the scourging 
and crowning of Christ (See S. John.) Here is a transposition. 

Saying, I am innocent I condemn Him against my will. Ye are 
the offenders. Ye are guilty of His death. How foolish was this 
timid, heartless, and slothful Governor in speaking thus! Why 
opposest thou not the injustice of the people? “Seek not to be 
judge, if thou canst not by thy power break through iniquities” 
(Eccles. viL 6). At another time thou didst let loose the soldiers 
on the riotous mob (Joseph. B. J. y xviii. 4). Why dost thou not 
act thus firmly now? If thou canst not, through the fury of the 
Jews, set Him free now, at least delay thy sentence till their fury 
subsides. 

S. Chrysostom (in Luke xxiii. 22) says, “Though he washed his 
hands, and said he was innocent, yet his permitting it was a sign 
of weakness and cowardice. For he ought never to have yielded 
Him up, but rather rescued Him, as the Centurion S. Paul ” (Acts 
xxi. 33). S. Augustine more forcibly (Serm. cxviiL de Temp.\ 
“Though Pilate washed his hands, yet he washed not away his 
guilt; for though he thought he was washing away the Blood of 
that Just One from his limbs, yet was his mind still stained with 
it It was he, in fact, who slew Christ by giving Him up to 
be slain. For a firm and good judge should not condemn inno- 
cent blood, either through fear or the risk of being unpopular.” 
And S. Leo (Serm. viii. de Pass.) said, “Pilate did not escape 
guilt, for by siding with the turbulent mob he became partner of 
others’ guilt” 

Ver. 25. Then answered all the people , and said, His blood be on 
us, and on our children. Let the guilt thou fearest be transferred 
from thee to us. If there be any guilt, may we and our posterity 
atone for it But we do not acknowledge any guilt, and con-

sequently, as not fearing any punishment, we boldly call it down 
on ourselves. And thus have they subjected not only themselves, 
but their very latest descendants, to God’s displeasure. They feel 
it indeed even to this day in its full force, in being scattered over 
all the world, without a city, or temple, or sacrifice, or priest, or 
prince, and being a subject race in all countries. It was, too, 
in punishment for Christ’s crucifixion that Titus ordered five hun- 
dred Jews to be crucified every day at the siege of Jerusalem, 
as they crowded out of the city in search of food, “so that at 
last there was no room for the crosses, and no crosses for the 
bodies” (Joseph. B.J. , vL 12). “This curse,” says Jerome, “rests 
on them even to this day, and the blood of the Lord is not taken 
away from them,” as Daniel foretold (ix. 27). 

Strange stories are told by Cardinal Hugo of special diseases 
which attacked the Jews, in periodical loss of blood, eta, though 
Salmeron and Abulensis [Tostatus] attribute them to natural 
causes. 

Ver. 26. Then (when the Jews had taken on themselves the 
guilt of Christ’s death) released he Barabbas unto them: and when 
he had scourged Jesus , he delivered Him to be crucified. S. Matthew, 
as usual, slightly touches on the scourging ; S. Mark and S. Luke 
speak of it more fully, and reckon this as Pilate’s fifth appeal 
to the compassion of the Jews, to induce them to ask for His 
life. 

Observe — 1. Scourging among the Romans was the punishment 
of slaves. (See Ft de Pcenis 1 . “ Servorum,” and the Lex 
Sempronia.) S. Paul, as a Roman citizen, protested against being 
scourged (Acts xvl). Martyrs were scourged by way of disgrace, 
of which many instances are given. 2. Free persons also were 
scourged after they had been condemned to death, as though they 
had thus become slaves. Hence the fasces had rods for scourg- 
ing, and the axe for executions. 3. This scourging of Christ was 
before His condemnation, and He was thus spared the usual 
scourging afterwards. For one scourging only is spoken of in 
the Gospels. 4. S. Jerome ( Epitaph. Paula r), S. Paulinus (Ep.

THE SCOURGING. 


269 


xxxi v.), Prudentius, and others (see Gretser, de Cruce y Lib . L), say 
that Christ was fastened to a column to be scourged, and that 
this column was afterwards placed in the Church of S. Praxedes 
at Rome. But the column which is there is very small, and is 
consequently supposed to be only a part of the large column 
mentioned by S. Jerome. Bosius maintains that it is the whole 
of the column, and that S. Jerome is speaking of the column at 
which Christ was first scourged S. Chrysostom considered that 
there were two scourgings. But most probably it was only part 
of the column S. Jerome mentions, or one of those to which He 
was bound in the house of Caiaphas, and the larger one that at 
which He was scourged in the house of the Governor. 

But in what respects was this scourging so cruel and savage? 

1. Christ being bound to this short column, and standing with 
the whole height of His body above it, was quite at the mercy of 
those who scourged Him. Again, the mere exposure of His most 
pure and virgin body to these filthy mockers was a sore affliction 
to Him. But He was twice, or as some say thrice, stripped ; first, 
at His scourging; secondly, when crowned with thorns. This 
stripping was attended with the greatest pain ; for as His garment 
stuck to His wounds, they were forcibly reopened as it was tom 
away. 

The forty martyrs were animated by this example, when they 
boldly stripped themselves and plunged into the freezing water. 
(See S. Basil’s Homily .) 

2. Pilate wished to excite the compassion of the Jews by saying, 
“ Behold the man.” Behold Him who has no longer the appear- 
ance of a man, but of some slaughtered animal, so besmeared 
was He with blood and marred in His form. 

3. The soldiers had of their own wanton cruelty crowned Him 
with thorns, and perhaps had been bribed by the Jews to scourge 
Him with greater severity. The blessed Magdalene of Pazzi, a 
nun of Florence, saw in a trance Christ scourged by thirty pairs 
of men, one after the other. Some say that He had 5000 blows 
inflicted on Him. S. Bridget is said to have had the exact

number (5475) revealed to her. From such a scourging as this 
He would have died naturally again and again, had not His God- 
head specially sustained Him. 

4. His bodily frame was most delicate, and acutely sensitive 
to pain, as fashioned by the Holy Spirit, and He consequently 
felt the scourging more severely than we should have done. 

5. The prophets, and also Christ Himself foretold that this 
scourging would be most heavy and severe. See S. Matt xx. 19, 
and Job xvi. 14, “He brake Me with wound upon wound.” 
They added, f>., blows to blows, wounds to wounds, so that the 
whole body seemed one continuous wound. Conf. Ps. Ixxiii. 14, 
“All the day long have I been scourged;” and Ps. cxxix. 3, 
“The sinners wrought upon my back as smiths on an anvil;” 
but the Hebrew [and A.V.], “The ploughers ploughed upon My 
back,” they made furrows on My back with scourges. So, too, 
Aquila and Theodot This is also indicated by Jacob’s words 
(Gen. xlix. 11), “He shall wash His garments in wine, and His 
clothes in the blood of the grape,” meaning by His garments and 
clothes His flesh, and by the wine His blood. 

6. Christ was scourged, as slaves were, with small ropes or 
thongs. Some suppose that He was scourged: 1. with rods of 
thorns; a. with cords and iron goads; 3. with chains made of 
hooks. Antonius Gallus (de Cruciatu Martyrum) describes the 
various kinds of scourges which were used. 

S. Bridget says that the Blessed Virgin was present at the 
scourging, and that her pain and sorrow added wondrously to 
His. She describes also the mode and the barbarity of His 
scourging (S. Bridget, Rev. L 10). 

Now Christ wished in this way to atone for our evil lusts and 
manifold sins. And in doing this (says S. Thom., par. iii. sec. 
46, art. 6, ad. 6), He considered not only the great virtue of 
His sufferings from the union of His Godhead with His human 
nature, but also how much it would avail even in that nature for 
making satisfaction. Moreover, He wished to obtain power and 
strength for all martyrs, in order to their enduring every kind of

scourging. Conf. Isa. liii. 5. In all this Christ manifested most 
marvellous patience. He uttered not a groan, gave no indication 
of pain, stood firm as a rock. Nay, He lorded it over all suf- 
ferings, as being above them. Such a temper obtained heathen 
admiration. S. Cyprian (de Bono Patient cap. iii.), among the 
proofs of His Divine Majesty, speaks of “ His continuous endur- 
ance, in which He exhibited the patience of His Father.” Ter- 
tullian, too (de Pat \ cap. iii.), “ He who had proposed to hide Him- 
self in man’s form, exhibited nought of man’s impatience. And in 
this ye Pharisees ought to have specially recognised the Lord.” 
S. Ambrose, too (Serm. xvii. in Ps. cxviii.) [cxix.], speaks of His 
u triumphant silence under calumny.” The Jews ought to have 
gathered from this the conclusion of the Centurion, “ Truly this 
was the Son of God.” All this was caused by His love of God and 
man. Love triumphed over pain, and made His pains as nothing. 
And hence He was willing to suffer in all points, and in all His 
members and senses. S. Thomas (par iii. qu. 46, art 5) thus 
writes, “ He suffered in the desertion of His friends, in His credit, 
in His honour, in the spoiling of His goods, in His soul by sorrow, 
in His body by His wounds. He suffered too in all parts of His 
body, and in every sense.” But His sufferings of mind were by 
far the greatest For He was specially wounded by the sins of 

each single man. He grieved also for the multitude of the lost 
He had sympathy for the martyrs and others who had to endure 
sufferings. But His boundless love urged Him on to endure all 
this. For love is the measure of pain, and we cannot live in love 
without pain. Hence it is said of Christ, “ Sculptured, thou seest 
His love in every limb.” 

Delivered Him to be crucified. After His scourging and crown- 
ing with thorns, which comes next, as I have said (ver. 24). This 
is therefore a transposition. S. Matthew here relates many things 
briefly, which S. John (xix. 1-16) records more fully. Pilate 
then delivered Jesus to the Jews, after he had condemned Him. 
Adrichomius (p. 163) gives Pilate’s supposed sentence, which states 
that the charges had been proved; making these charges, which

he knew to be false, a cloak for his own sloth and injustice; the 
Chief Priests gave no proofs but merely made false and calumnious 
assertions. 

Pilate in his rescript to Tiberius says that he had condemned 
Jesus through the importunity of the Jews, though He was in 
other respects a holy and divine man. Orosius ( Hist '. vii. 4) 
speaks of his testimony to Christ’s virtues ; and Eusebius (in 
Chron. ad an . 38), that he spoke in favour of Christians to 
Tiberius, who proposed that Christianity should be recognised 
among other religions. (Conf. Tert Apol. cap. 5 and 21 ; Eusebius, 
Hist EccL ii. 2, and others.) 

Christ, then, was on Pilate's own testimony most unjustly con- 
demned by him ; for envy accused, hatred witnessed against Him ; 
His crime was innocence ; fear perverted judgment, ambition con- 
demned, cruelty punished. 

Ver. 27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the 
common hall. “ Then ” refers not to the preceding words, 
“delivered Him to be crucified,” but to the scourging. The 
soldiers scourged Jesus, and crowned Him at the same time with 
thorns. 

Gathered unto Him the whole band \ to adorn Him, by way of 
insult, with the royal insignia, as pretending to be King of the 
Jews. “For soldiers are a cruel race,” says S. Chrysostom, “and 
take pleasure in insulting.” It was the Praetorian Band, quartered 
in the castle of Antonia. 

Ver. 28. And they stripped Him , and put on Him a scarlet robe. 
“Making jest of Him,” says Origen. This stripping can be 
referred either to His scourging or to His crowning with thorns. 
It is consequently uncertain whether He resumed His garments 
after He had been scourged, and was stripped of them again and 
arrayed in the scarlet robe, or whether the scarlet robe was put 
upon His naked body immediately after His scourging. 

Symbolically: “In the scarlet robe,” says S. Jerome, “the Lord 
bears the blood-stained works of the Gentiles.” “ He bare,” says 
S. Athanasius, “in the scarlet garment a resemblance to the blood

THE PURPLE ROBE.

wherewith the earth had been polluted.” And Origen, “The 
Lord, by taking on Him the scarlet robe, took on Himself the 
blood, that is, the sins of the world, which are bloody and red as 
scarlet ; for the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” 

Anagogically : S. Gregory, “ For what is purple save blood, and 
the endurance of sufferings, manifested for love of the Kingdom?” 
And again, “The Lord made His empurpled ascent in a triumphal 
litter, because we attain to the Kingdom that is within through 
tribulation and blood.” 

S. Mark and S. John call this a purple garment (not scarlet). 
S. Ambrose says they were two different garments, and that He 
was arrayed in both. Gretser {Lib. 1, de Cruce) gives authorities 
for there being only one garment, called indifferently purple or 
scarlet Perhaps the garment had been twice dyed, — with the 
murex and the coccus; and garments thus dyed are of a more 
lasting colour. Now this was a kingly dress, and thus did they 
make Christ a King in mockery. This robe or chlamys was shorter 
and tighter than the pallium, and soldiers wore it over their armour. 
The one then used seems to have been the worn out dress of 
some Roman soldier, but being purple, was of the imperial colour. 

Symbolically: S. Cyril (in John xii. 15) says, “By the purple 
garment is signified the sovereignty over the whole world, which 
Christ was about to receive.” So, too, Origen, S. Augustine, and 
others. But this He obtained for Himself by fighting and shedding 
His blood. African and other soldiers anciently wore red garments. 
See, too, Nahum ii. 3. 

Ver. 29. And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put 
it upon His head. This was done both for insult and for torture. 
It was done, too, by Jewish insolence, and not by Pilate's order, 
though he permitted it (see above on ver. 25). These thorns were 
those of the sea-rush or of the blackthorn ; perhaps the two sorts 
were twisted together. S. Helena brought two of them to Rome 
and placed them in the Church of Santa Croce. S. Bridget (Rev. 
L 10) says that the crown was placed a second time on His head 

when on the Cross; that it came down to the middle of His

forehead, and that such streams of blood flowed from the wounds 
as to run down to His eyes and ears, and even to His beard ; that 
He seemed one mass of blood. He could not indeed see His 
Mother till the blood had been squeezed out of His eyelids. All 
pictures represent Him as crucified with the crown of thorns, as 
Origen and Tertullian distinctly assert He was: The torture of all 

this was very great, for the thorns were very sharp, and also driven 
into the head and brain. The literal object of this was to insult 
and torture Christ for pretending to be King of the Jews. 

But Origen gives its mystical meaning, “ In this crown the Lord 
took on Himself the thorns of our sins woven together on His 
head.” For S. Hilary says “the sting of sin is in the thorns of 
which Christ’s victorious crown is woven.” “Let me ask you,” 
says Tertullian (de Con, Milit. ad fin.\ “ what crown did Jesus wear 
for both sexes? Of thorns, methinks, and briars, as a figure of 
those sins which the earth of our flesh hath brought forth unto us, 
but which the virtue of the Cross hath taken away, crushing (as it 
did) all the stings of death by the sufferings of the head of the 
Lord. For besides the figurative meaning there is assuredly the 
contumely, disgrace, and dishonour, and, blended with them, the 
cruelty, which thus both defiled and wounded His brows.” 

Tropologically : The thorns teach us to wound and subdue the 
flesh with fastings, haircloths, and disciplines. “For it is not 
fitting that the members of a thorn-crowned Head should be 
delicate,” says S. Bernard. And Tertullian ( ut supra) teaches us 
that Christians, out of reverence for Christ’s crown of thorns, did 
not wear crowns of flowers,; as the heathen did. Christ offered 
S. Catharine of Sienna two crowns, — one of jewels, the other of 
thorns, — on condition that if she chose one of them in this life she 
should wear the other in the next. She seized at once the crown 
of thorns from His hand, and fixed it so firmly on her head that 
she felt pain for many days, and therefore she received a jewelled 
crown in heaven. S. Agapitus, a youth of only fifteen, when live _ 
coals were put on his head, said exultingly, “ It is a small matter 
that that head which is to be crowned in heaven should be burned

on earth,” &c. Think, then, when enduring any kind of pain, 
that Christ is giving thee one of the thorns from His crown. 

Anagogically ; S. Ambrose (in Luke xxii.) says, “This crown 
placed on His head shows that triumphant glory should be won 
for God from sinners of this world, as if from the thorns of this 
life.” 

Symbolically : S. Bernard (dc Pass. Dom. cap . xix.) says, “Though 
they crown Him in derision, yet in their ignorant mockery they 
confess Him to be a crowned King. Therefore is He proved to 
be a King by those who knew Him not.” And S. Augustine 
{Traci, cxvi. in John) says, “Thus did the Kingdom which was not 
of this world overcome the proud world, not with fierce fighting, 
but lowly suffering. [Jesus comes forth] wearing the crown of thorns 
and the purple robe, not resplendent in power, but overwhelmed 
with reproach.” “Purple,” again says Elias Cratensis, “exhorts 
good rulers to be ready to shed their blood for the benefit of their 
subjects.” Hence the purple is given to Cardinals to remind them 
that they should shed their blood for the Church ; and S. Germanus, 
Patriarch of C. P. (Oral, in Scpult. Christ t), says that the purple 
robe and the crown of thorns which was placed on Him before His 
crucifixion assured the victory to Him who said, “Be of good 
cheer, I have overcome the world.” 

[Pseudo-] Athanasius (dc Cruce) strikingly says, “When the Lord 
was arrayed in the purple, there was raised invisibly a trophy over 
the devil. It was a strange and incredible marvel, and doubtless 
a token of great victory, that they placed the ornaments of triumph 
on Him whom they had struck in mockery and derision. He went 
forth to death in this array, to show that the victory was won 
expressly for our salvation.” He points out also that Christ was 
crowned with thorns to restore to us the tree of life, and to heal 
our worldly cares and anxieties by taking them on Himself. 

Godfrey of Bouillon refused on this ground to be crowned king 
of Jerusalem, since it ill became a Christian king to wear a crown 
of gold in the very city in which Christ had worn one of thorns. 

The tonsure of priests and monks represents this “crown of

thorns,” and is a token of their humility and contempt of the 
world (Bede, Hist . Angl. v. 22, and S. Germanus, C. P., in Thtor. 
rer. E celts.). 

Anagogically : Tertullian (de Cor. Mil. cap. xiv.) says, Put on 
Christ’s crown of thorns, “that so thou mayest rival that crown 
which afterwards was His, for it was after the gall that He tasted 
the honey ; nor was He saluted as King by the heavenly hosts till 
He had been written up upon the Cross as the King of the Jews. 
Being made by the Father a little lower than the angels, He was 
afterwards crowned with glory and honour.” “Christ,” says S. 
Jerome, “was crowned with thorns that He might win for us a 
royal diadem.” 

And a retd in His right hand. This, which represented His 
sceptre as King of the Jews, was a fragile, worthless, mean, and 
ridiculous thing. It is described as a smooth cane with a woolly 
top, &c. 

Symbolically : S. Jerome and [Pseudo-]Athanasius say, as the 
reed drives away and kills serpents, so does Christ venomous lusts. 
Hear S. Jerome: “As Caiaphas knew not what He said (John 
xi. 50 stq.), so they too, though acting with another intent, yet 
furnished us believers with mysteries (sacramtnia). In the scarlet 
robe He bears on Him the blood-stained deeds of the Gentiles; 
in the crown of thorns He does away with the ancient curse; 
with the reed He destroys poisonous animals, or (in another sense) 
He holds in His hand the reed to record the sacrilege of the 
Jews.” S. Ambrose too (in Luke xxii.) says, “The reed is held 
in Christ’s hand that human weakness should no more be moved 
as a reed with the wind, but be strengthened and made firm by 
the works of Christ ; or, as S. Mark says, it strikes His head that 
our nature, strengthened by contact with His Godhead, should 
waver no more.” This reed and other relics of the Passion are 
said to have been carefully preserved (Bede, de Con. Sanctis 9 
cap. xx. ; and Greg. Turon. de Gloria Martyrum, cap. vil).

Bringing together the whole band as an attendant army. His 
throne a stone or seat, raised up like a tribunal His crown was 
of thorns, His robe a scarlet chlamys, His sceptre a reed ; in the 
place of the people’s applause were the mockings of the soldiers ; 
there were the spittings, the blows, and the stripes. All these did 
Christ bear with divine humility and patience, and thus deserved 
“ tkat at the name,” &c. (Phil. ii. io). 

Tropologically ; Christ here wished to set forth the vain estate 
and the sufferings of all kings and rulers; to turn all insults into 
weapons of victory, and specially to overcome the pride of Satan 
by His humility ; to teach that worldly kingdoms consisted in pomp 
and display, His in contempt of honour, pleasures, and self. See 
Theophylact, Jansenius [Gaudno], Pseudo-Athanasius, and Ter- 
tullian, ut supra. 

It is to be noted that Agrippa was shortly afterwards insulted at 
Alexandria exactly in the same way. See Philo, in Flaccum . 

Ver. 30. And they spit upon Him y and took the reed 9 and smote 
Him on the head. As having foolishly aspired to be King of Judea; 
to drive also the crown of thorns more firmly into His head. 
These grossest insults and most cruel pains were devised by devils 
rather than men, says Origen. “Not one member only, but the 
whole body suffered these atrocious injuries,” &c, says S. Chrysos- 
tom. Here comes in John xix. 1-16. Pilate’s presenting Christ 
to the people to excite their compassion ; their vehement demand 
that He should be crucified, as making Himself the Son of God. 
Pilate on hearing this was startled, and asked Him who He was, 
as if He might have been the son of some heathen god who might 
avenge His death. When He gave no answer, Pilate added that 
He had power to put Him to death, which brought out our Lord’s 
reply, that he had no power over Him, “ unless it were given him 
from above.” For Pilate, notwithstanding his paramount authority 
over other Jews, had but a permissive authority over Christ, who, 
as the Son of God, was not subject to any human power. Pilate 
then, in judging and condemning Christ, sinned in a threefold way : 
by usurping an authority over Him which He really had not;

by yielding to the clamour of the Jews; and by condemning an 
innocent man. 

Ver. 31. And after that they had mocked Him they took the robe 
off from Him . “After they had fully satiated themselves with 
their insults,” Victor of Antioch on Mark xv. “ But they left on 
Him (says Origen) the crown of thorns. ” “ He is stripped,” says 

[Pseudo-]Athanasius, “by His executioners of the coats of skins 
which we had put on in Adam, that for these we might put on 
Christ.” 

And put His onm raiment on Him . That they who crucified 
Him might claim it as their own, and also that He might thus 
be recognised and be insulted the more. 

And led Him away to crucify Him . Preceded, it would seem, by 
a trumpeter, who summoned the people to the execution (Gretser, 
de Cruce , 1. 16). Now Christ was worn out by having been 
constantly on foot both through the night and on the morning. 
(Adrichomius calculated the exact distances.) Accordingly, 

Ver. 32. As they came out (either from Pilate's house, so S. 
Jerome — or from the city, so Fr. Lucas and others) they found a 
man of Cyrene . Either Cyrene in Libya, or in Syria, or in Cyprus, 
from whence he came to Judea. He was a Gentile (S. Hilary, 
S. Ambrose, S. Leo, Bede, and others), though Maldonatus and 
Fr. Lucas consider he was a Jew, having probably become a pro- 
selyte on coming to Judea. This signified that the Gentiles would 
believe in Christ, and that the Jews would be eventually converted 
by their means. 

Simon by name. Pererius mentions the tradition that he and 
his afterwards became Christians. S. Mark adds that he was the 
father of Alexander and Rufus, who, it seems, were well known in 
his day as Christians. (Rufus was first Bishop of Thebes and 
afterwards of Tortosa. He is mentioned by Polycarp (ad Philipp . 
chap. ix.). Alexander was martyred at Carthagena, March 11.) 
Some suppose Simon or Niger (Acts xiil 1) to be the same 
person.

injury and insult which they put on Simon as a stranger. But he 
bore it all with patience, and therefore was enlightened by Christ, 
and became, as I have said, a Christian. He was a sharer in His 
Cross first, and afterwards a partaker of His joy. 

Symbolically: S. Gregory (Afor. viii. 44), “ To bear the Cross 
by compulsion is to submit to affliction and abstinence from some 
other motive than the proper one. Does not He bear the Cross 
by compulsion who subdues his flesh, as if at Christ's command, 
but yet loves not the spiritual country ? So, too, Simon bears the 
Cross, and yet dies not under it, since every hypocrite chastens, 
indeed, his body by abstinence, and yet through love of glory lives 
to the world.” 

To bear the cross . Christ at first bare His own Cross, fifteen 
feet high (as is said) and eight feet across. And that, too, when 
covered all over with blood, wearied, and broken down. He 
supported one end on His shoulder, and dragged the other along 
the ground. He thus constantly struck against the stones, and 
so reopened His wounds, causing continual pain. S. John says, 
“He went forth bearing His cross” (xix. 17), as was customary 
with criminals (see Lipsius and Gretser). But when the soldiers 
saw that He was sinking under it, they placed it on Simon, to 
keep Jesus alive, and reserve Him for greater sufferings. They 
wished, too, to get quickly over their work, and then go home to 
their meal, for it was now mid-day. 

It does not appear that Simon carried the Cross with Jesus in 
front and himself behind, but that he bare it alone. (See Luke 
xxiii. 26.) The Fathers here discern various mysteries. 

[Pseudo-] Athanasius, “The Lord both bear His own Cross, and 
again Simon bare it also. He bare it first as a trophy against 
the devil, and of His own will, for He went without any compul- 
sion to His death. But afterwards the man Simon bare it, to 
make it known to all that the Lord died not as His own due, but 
as that of all mankind.” S. Ambrose (in Luke xxiii.), “ He first 
lifted up the trophy of His Cross, and afterwards handed it to His 
martyrs to do the like. For it was meet that He should first lift

up His own trophy as victor, and that afterwards Christ should 
bear it in man, and man in Christ” 

Origen, “It was not only meet that He should take up His 
Cross Himself, but that we also should bear it, and thus perform a 
compulsory but salutary service” (see Matt x. 38). It was the 
heresy of Basilides and Marcion, that Christ, having dazzled the 
eyes of the Jews, disappeared from their sight and left Simon 
behind, who was crucified in His stead. This, too, is the error of 
the Mahometans. 

Here comes in, from Luke xxiil 31, our Lord’s meeting the 
women on His way to Calvary, and telling them not to weep for 
Him ; “ for if they do these things in the green tree,” &c. For He 
Himself was a green tree, ever flourishing with the branches and 
fruits of grace, and thus unsuited for the fire of God’s vengeance. 
But the Jews were a dry tree, void of grace and barren of good 
works, and thus most fitted for the fire of His wrath. One of these 
women, Berenice or Veronica, offered Christ a napkin to wipe His 
face, and received it back from Him with His features marked on 
it (see Marianus, Scotus, Baronius, and others). The napkin is 
said to be preserved at Rome. 

Ver. 33. And they came unto a place called Golgotha, that is to 
say , a place of a skull. “ Calvary ” is the bare skull of a man ; 
Golgotha means the same; so called from its roundness; from 
the root “gal” or “gabal,” to roll about. Some suppose that S. 
Matthew wrote in Greek and himself explained the Hebrew ; others 
that the explanation was given by the Greek translator of the 
original Hebrew. 

But why was the place so called ? Some say because Adam was 
there buried, and redeemed, too, by Christ on the same spot by 
the Blood of the Cross, and restored to the life of grace. See note 
on Eph. v. 14, and the Fathers there quoted. For there was a 
tradition that Noah took the bones of Adam into the ark, and 
after the deluge gave the skull, and Judaea with it, to Shem, his 
favourite son. Such respect did the ancients pay to their dead 
from believing in the immortality of the soul. “Christ,” says

NAME OF CALVARY PROPHETIC. 


281 


S. Ambrose (in Luke xxiii.), “was crucified in Golgotha because 
it was fitting that the first-fruits of our life should rest in the very 
spot from which our death had come.” Others give a more literal 
and obvious reason, that it was because criminals were there 
beheaded. Baronius and others reject this view, on the ground 
that beheading was not a Jewish practice. But it is certain that 
after the Roman conquest criminals were beheaded, as John the 
Baptist by Herod Antipas and S. James by Herod Agrippa. 
Besides this, there were lying about on that spot the skulls of 
those who had died in various other ways. 

Mystically : Gretser says, “ It was prophetically called Golgotha, 
because Christ our Lord, our true Head, there died.” 

It was Christ’s own will to be crucified in a dishonourable place 
like this, in order to expiate our infamous and execrable sins. 
He thus converted it into one of honour and adoration, for Chris- 
tians in Calvary reverence and adore Christ crucified. For Christ, 
as Sedulius says, — 

M With glory all our sufferings hath arrayed. 

And sanctified the torments He endured." 

So, too, Seneca (Cons, ad Helvidiam) says that Socrates entered 
the prison to take away the ignominy from the place. 

Bede (dc Locis Sanctis , cap . ii.) observes, from S. Jerome and 
S. Augustine (Serm. lxxi. dc temp .), that Abraham offered up his son 
on this very mountain. For Mount Moriah and Calvary are close 
together, and they look like one mountain parted into two ridges 
or hills. 

The Apostle (Heb. xiii. 11 seg.) gives four reasons for Christ 
being crucified outside Jerusalem, and thence concludes, “ Let us 
go forth to Him without the camp, bearing His reproach.” It was 
chiefly to signify that the virtues of His Cross were to be trans- 
ferred from the Jews to all nations, that “the Cross of Christ 
might be the altar, not of the temple, but of the world ” (S. Leo, 
Serm. ix. dc Pass.). 

Ver. 34. And they gave Him wine (Arab, and A. V., vinegar)

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


to drink mingled with gall \ This was while the Cross was being 
made ready, and Christ was resting for a while. Wine used to 
be given to condemned criminals to quench their thirst, and to 
strengthen them also to endure their sufferings, as it is said (Prov. 
xxxi. 6), “ Give strong drink unto those that are ready to perish, 
and wine to those in bitterness of heart.” But the Jews, with 
untold barbarity, made this wine bitter with gall, partly to insult 
and partly to give Him pain. Whence Christ complains, “ They 
gave Me gall to eat” (Tertullian, Lib . x. contra Judceos , reads 
“to drink”); for the gall was Christ's food, the wine His drink, 
Euthymius thinks that bits of dried gall were steeped in vinegar, 
so that the vinegar was in the place of wine, and the bits of gall 
instead of the morsel of bread which is thrown into the wine, that 
those who are faint might drink first and eat afterwards. 

This was different from the draught given to Christ on the Cross, 
this being of wine, the latter of vinegar. The Greek writers here 
mention “ vinegar,” but it was probably only a sour kind of wine. 
On the first occasion Christ says, “They gave Me gall to eat;” on 
the second, “ They gave Me vinegar to drink.” S. Mark terms it 
“wine mingled with myrrh,” myrrh and gall having been mixed 
together, or because the myrrh, from being bitter, was called gall 
So say all the Fathers and commentators, except Baronius, who 
considered that the wine was flavoured with myrrh and other 
spices. But the Jews would not have allowed this to be given 
to Christ. Baronius seems afterwards (vol. x. ad fin.) to have 
changed his opinion. 

And when He had tasted thereof He would not drink. Either as 
offended at the Jews for offering so nauseous a draught, or as 
wishing to suffer greater thirst on the Cross, and thus set us an 
example of self-mortification. 

Palamon is said to have refused to taste some wild herbs which 
his disciple Pachomius had, for his Easter repast, flavoured with 
oil, saying, “My Lord had vinegar to drink, and shall I taste 
oil?”

ANGUISH OF THE CRUCIFIXION. 


283 


Matthew here studies brevity (as usual), and partly shrinks with 
horror from the crucifixion, not speaking of it as an actual occur- 
rence, but only by the way. It is a doctrine of the faith that 
Christ was nailed, not merely tied, to the Cross. (See John xx. 25, 
and Ps. xxii. 16.) But it is possible that ropes were used as well, 
so says S. Hilary (Lib. x. de Trin.). The ropes are to be seen in the 
Church of Santa Croce at Rome. Nonnus, in his paraphrase of 
S. John, says that Christ’s hands were fastened to the Cross with 
an iron band as well as by nails. The Cross, he says, was first 
raised up, and then a huge nail driven through both feet, laid one 
over the other. Some writers speak of a support for the feet to 
rest on, or a space hollowed out for the heels ; and questions, too, 
are raised as to the number of the nails, whether three or four (or, 
as S. Bernard suggests, six), and the direction in which they were 
driven so as to cause the greatest torture. 

The anguish of the crucifixion was very great; because the 
tenderest parts of the body were pierced by the nails, and the 
whole weight hung from the hands. The pain was lasting, Christ 
hanging on the Cross for three hours. Mystically, the words 
spoken of Jerusalem (Lam. i. 12) are applicable to Christ Very 
great pain, too, was caused by the racking and stretching out of 
His limbs. S. Catharine of Sienna said she had practically experi- 
enced this when she had been made by Christ a partaker of all 
His sufferings. His bones were able to be counted when He was 
thus stretched out. It is in the Hebrew, “I will tell all My 
bones,” that is, I am able to do so. But the Vulgate has it, “they 
counted,” since Christ, while suffering such torture, was not able 
to count them Himself. 

He was crucified with the crown of thorns, and between two 
robbers, as though He were the chief of them; and naked too, 
after the Roman custom. Some suppose that He was entirely 
naked, though others consider that this would have been too 
unseemly before a crowd of both sexes. This, then, was the 
greatest shame and pain to One who was so pre-eminently modest 
and chaste. S. Ambrose (in Luke xxiii.) says, “Naked He

ascends the Cross. I behold Him naked. Let him who is pre- 
paring to conquer the world ascend in like manner, not seeking 
worldly supports. Adam, who sought to get clothing, was a 
conquered person. But He who laid aside His garments, and 
went up on the Cross just as nature had made Him, was a con- 
queror.” “Adam,” said Tauler (Excerc. Vit. Christi, cap . xxxiii.), 
“ hasted to clothe himself because he had lost his innocence, but 
Christ was stripped naked because He had preserved His inno- 
cence, and needed no other covering.” S. Francis, wishing to 
follow Christ’s example, threw himself, when dying, naked on the 
ground. See notes on S. Matt v. 3. 

S. Flavia, a noble virgin and martyr, when she was exposed 
naked at the command of the tyrant Manucha, to make her 
deny Christ, said, “ I am ready to endure not merely the stripping 
of my body, but also the fire and the sword, for Him who was 
willing to suffer all this for me ” (see Acta S. Placidi \ art . 5). 

It is generally thought that Christ was nailed to the Cross when 
lying on the ground, as was the case with those who carried their 
own cross. S. Anselm, S. Laur. Justiniani, and others hold this 
view; S. Bonaventura, Lipsius, and others, the contrary, which is 
supported by the text (Cant, vil 8), “ I will go up to the palm- 
tree,” on which passage see the notes. But it is quite an open 
question. 

But why was Christ crucified rather than put to death in any 
other way? The obvious reason was, that the Jews wished to 
inflict on Him a most ignominious death, and thus bring discredit 
on His name and followers. They wished Him also to bear the 
punishment which was due to Barabbas, whom they preferred 
before Him. But on God’s part the reason was to save by 
the foolishness of the Cross those that believed (see 1 Cor. 
il 23). 

Besides which, victims of old time were lifted up as offerings, 
and afterwards burnt. And so, too, Christ, who offered Himself 
as a burnt-offering for our sins, was raised up on the Cross, and 
burnt and consumed there, not so much with pain as with love

CAUSES OF THE CRUCIFIXION. 285 

for men ; just as the paschal lamb was stretched on the spit in the 
form of a cross, and then roasted. 

There were various moral causes on the part of Christ and of 
men. 1st That as Adam and Eve sinned by stretching forth 
their hands to the forbidden tree, so Christ might atone for their 
sin by stretching forth His hands to the wood of the Cross (so 
Augustine in Append. Serm. de Diversis iv.). Whence the Church 
sings, “By a tree we were made slaves, and by the holy cross 
have we been set free” (in the Office for Sept 14); and “that 
life might spring from that from which death arose, and that he 
who conquered by the tree might be conquered by the tree.* 1 
And S. Greg. Naz. (in Orat. de Seipso), “We are by the tree 
of disgrace brought back to the tree of life which we had lost” 
And S. Ambrose (in Luke iv.), “Death by the tree, life by the 
cross.” Nay, Christ Himself says, “I raised thee up under the 
apple-tree ; there was thy mother defiled, there was she defiled that 
bare thee.” The Cross, again, is the remedy and expiation of the 
concupiscence which came from Adam’s sin, itself the fount and 
origin of all sins. Christ therefore teaches us by the pattern of 
His Cross continually to crucify and mortify our evil affections, if 
we wish to avoid sin and save our souls (S. Ath. de Incam. Verbi ). 

ad. That by hanging between Heaven and earth He might recon- 
cile those in Heaven and those on earth. So S. Ambrose (in Luc. 
xxiii.), “ That He might conquer not for Himself only, but for all, 
He extended His arms on the Cross to draw all things to Himself, 
to free from the bands of death, raise aloft by the balances of faith, 
and associate with things in Heaven the things that before were 
earthly.” So too [Amoldus apud] Cyprian, “I see Thee victorious 
over sufferings, with uplifted hands triumphing over Amalek, bear- 
ing up into the heavens the standard of Thy victory, and raising up 
for those below a ladder of ascent to the Father.” 

Hence S. Jerome teaches that Christ on the Cross embraces the 
four quarters of the world with its four arms. In its very shape 
does it not resemble the four quarters? The east shines from 
the top, at the right is the north, the south on the left, the west

firmly planted beneath His feet. Whence the Apostle says, “that 
we may know the height and breadth, and length and depth.” 
Birds fly in the form of a cross ; we swim or pray in the same form. 
The yards of a ship resemble a cross. And S. Greg. Naz. says 
(Carm. de Virg . ), — 

“ For stretching forth to earth's remotest bounds 
His sacred limbs. He brought the human race 
From every clime, and gathering them in one. 

He placed them in the very arms of God." 

As Christ said, “ I, if I be lifted up from the earth,” &c. 

S. Athanasius (de Incarn. Verbt) says, 44 If He came to bear our 
sins and curse, how could He have done so but by taking on 
Himself an execrable death ? But the Cross is that very death, as 
it is written, ‘Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree*” (Deut 
xxi. 25 ; Gal iii. 13). 

Besides this, all kinds of suffering concur in the Cross, and 
Christ embraced them all in His own, to set the martyrs an 
example of every kind of endurance. For the Cross wounds the 
hands and feet as a sword, it stretches out the body as a rack, 
lacerates it as a hoof, mangles it as a beast, burns and tortures 
it as a flame, and kills the whole man, as it were, with a slow 
fire. He experienced, then, the torments of all the Martyrs, and 
brought them before Himself, and was evil-entreated for their 
sakes, that He might obtain for all of them the power of over- 
coming them. As the blessed Laurence Justiniani says (de 
Triumph . Christt Agone , cap. xix.), 44 He was stoned in S. Stephen, 
burnt in S. Laurence, and bore the special sufferings of each 
several Martyr.” 

S. Augustine says further (Serm. lxix. de Diversis), 44 He refused 
to be stoned, or smitten with the sword, because we cannot always 
carry about stones or swords to defend ourselves. But He chose 
the Cross, which is made with a slight motion of the hand, and 
we are protected thereby against the craft of the enemy.” As 
S. Paul says, “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse,” &c. (GaL 
iii. 13).

GOD REIGNS FROM THE TREE. 


287 


S. Anselm (in Phil ii.) says, “He chose the worst kind of 
death, that He might overcome all death." As S. Augustine says 
(in Ps. cxl.), “ That His disciples should not only not fear death 
itself, but not even this kind of death.” And (de Ag. Christi , cap . 
xi.), “Fear not insults, and crosses, and death, for if they really 
were hurtful to men, the man whom the Son of God took upon 
Him would not have suffered them” (see S. Thomas, par. iiL 
Quasi. 48, art. 4). 

S. Athanasius (de Incam. Verb.) says, “The Lord came to cast 
down the devil, to purify the air, and to make for us a way to 
Heaven.” It was therefore requisite for Him to be crucified in 
the air (see S. Chrysost. de Cruce). S. Thomas (par. iii Quasi. 46, 
art. 4) gives many other reasons. Lastly, S. Basil (Horn, de Humil.) 
says, “ The devil was crucified in Him whom he hoped to crucify, 
and was put to death in Him whom he had hoped to destroy.” 
And S. Leo (Serm. x. de Pass.), “The nails of Christ pierced the 
devil with continuous wounds, and the suffering of His holy 
limbs was the destruction of the powers of the enemy.” 

Moreover, in the Cross that ancient reading of Ps. xcvl was 
made good, “ God hath reigned from the tree ; ” for, as S. Ambrose 
says (in Luke xxiii.), “ though He was on the Cross, yet He shone 
above the cross with royal majesty.” And as S. Augustine says, 
“ He subdued the world not by the sword, but by the tree ” ( Serm. 
21, Ben.). The Cross was the triumphal car of Christ, in which 
He triumphed over the devil, sin, death, and hell. S. Ambrose 
accordingly calls it “the chariot of the Conqueror, and the 
triumphal Cross.” 

The Cross is said to have been made of the cypress, cedar, 
palm, and olive : — 

“ Cedar the trunk, tall cypress holds His frame, 

Palm clasps His hands, and olive boasts His name.” 

(Dr. Littledalr’s Version in Cant. vii. 8.) 

For Christ was on the Cross exalted as a cedar, beauteous as the 
leafy cypress, poured forth the oil of grace as the olive, triumphed

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


over death as the victorious palm. So says [Arnold, apud] 
S. Cyprian, “ Thou hast gone up unto the palm tree, because the 
wood of thy Cross foretold Thy triumph over the devil, Thy 
victory over principalities, and powers, and spiritual wicked- 
nesses,” &c. 

In short, God willed the Cross to be the price of our redemption, 
a book of heavenly wisdom, a mirror of every virtue and per- 
fection. The book, I say, of the wisdom of God ; for in the suffer- 
ings of the Cross Christ set forth His supreme love for man, for 
whom He was so cruelly and ignominously crucified ; the heinous- 
ness of mortal sin, which could not be atoned for in any other 
way ; the awfulness of hell-torments (for if God punished so heavily 
the sins of others in Christ His Son, how will He not punish in 
hell-fire the personal guilt of sinners themselves ?) ; the value of 
each single soul, for which so great a price has been paid; the 
care which should be had for the salvation of souls, lest the Blood 
of Christ should be shed for them in vain; the great happiness 
in store for the blessed, as having been purchased by Christ on 
the Cross. Rightly, therefore, S. Augustine says ( Tract . cxix. in 
S. John), “The tree on which were fastened the limbs of the 
sufferer was the seat also of the Master and Teacher.” 

It is also the mirror of all virtue and perfection, for Christ on 
the Cross exhibited humility, poverty, patience, fortitude, con- 
stancy, mortification, charity, and all other virtues in their highest 
perfection. Look on Him, therefore, O Christian, and live “ac- 
cording to the pattern showed thee in the Mount” (Exod. 
xxv. 40). This, too, is the teaching of the Apostle (Eph. iii. 17), 
“ That ye being rooted and grounded in love,” &c. And accord- 
ingly the Martyrs strengthened themselves to bear all their 
sufferings by meditating on the Cross of Christ. As, e.g., S. 
Felicitas, S. Ignatius (whose saying At was, “ Jesus, My Love, is 
crucified”), the Brothers Marcus and Marcellinus (who said that 
“ they were never so glad at a feast as in enduring this for Christ’s 
sake; we have now begun to be fixed in the love of the Cross, 
may He permit us to suffer as long as we are clothed in this

corruptible body”): and, among others, the Martyrs of Japan. S. 
Francis, too, counted himself happy in receiving the Stigmata, 
and being thus conformed to Christ crucified. Those in “re- 
ligion” should also rejoice, as having been crucified with Christ 
by their three vows, which are, as it were, three nails they have 
taken to bear for Christ’s sake (see Pinutius apud Cassian, lib . iv. 
de Ins tit. Renunc. cap. 34, &c.). In a word, how holy, tender, and 
true was that couplet of S. Francis de Sales — 

M Or love or madness slew Thee, Saviour mine s 
Ours was the madness, Lord ; the love was Thine ! " 

But, next, on what day was Christ crucified? I answer, on March 
25, the day of His conception, on which day S. Dismas, the 
penitent thief, is commemorated. So say, too, S. Augustine (de 
Civ . lib. xviil ad fin.\ S. Chrysostom, Tertullian, S. Thomas, and 
others, whom Suarez follows (par. iii. disp. xL sect. 5, ad Jin.). 
This was the completion of His thirty-fourth year, the day too 
of the sacrifice of Isaac, and the passage of the Red Sea (both 
eminent types of Christ on the Cross), and of the victory of 
Michael the Archangel Hence it is inferred that the world and 
the angels were created on the same day, and that they began 
from the very first to war with each other. 

The hour was mid-day. “The sixth hour,” says & John 
(xix. 14), i.e. , from sunrise. S. Mark says “the third hour” 
(xv. 25), meaning the end of the third and the beginning of the 
sixth ; for these hours with the Jews and Romans contained three 
of ours. S. Mark clearly means this when he says (ver. 33), 
“ And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the 
whole land.” Theophylact speaks of the fitness of this: “Man 
was created on the sixth day, and on the sixth hour he ate of the 
tree. At the same hour that the Lord created man, did He heal 
him after his fall. On the sixth day, and on the sixth hour, was 
Christ nailed to the Cross.” Bede, among the Latins, takes the 
same view. “At the very hour when Adam brought death into 

the world did the second Adam by His dying destroy death.”

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


Many suppose that Adam was created on the same day of the 
year, and ate the forbidden fruit at the same hour, when Christ 
expiated his sin on the Cross. Tertullian (lib. L contra Marcion ) 
gives it in verse — 

M ’Twas on the day and place where Adam fell, 

As years rolled on the mighty athlete came 
And battle gave, where stood th’ accursed tree ; 

Stretched forth His hands, sought pain, despising praise, 

And triumphed over death.” 

Procopius says (in Gen. iii.), “It was at the same hour in 
which Adam ate of the tree.” 

But, observe, He was crucified with His back to Jerusalem, as 
though He were its enemy, and unworthy to look on it; but in 
truth, as being about to reject the Jews, and choose the Gentiles. 
He thus looked on the west (Rome and Italy). Christians ac- 
cordingly, by Apostolic usage, pray towards the east, as if looking 
at Christ crucified; and as the Crucifix in a Church looks west- 
ward, so must they who look towards and adore it necessarily 
look eastward. (See S. J. Damasc. de Fide , iv. 13; S. Jerome, 
&c.) Jeremiah prophesied this (xviii. 17), “I wiil show them 
the back,” &c. ; and David (Ps. lxvi. 7), “His eyes look upon 
the Gentiles.” 

S. Bridget speaks of the details of the Crucifixion as revealed 
to her by Christ (Rev. vil 15) and by the Blessed Virgin (Rev. 
L 10). 

To conclude, Lactantius (iv. 26) says, “Since he who is hung 
upon a cross is raised high above all about him, the Cross was 
chosen to signify that He would be raised so high that all nations 
would flock together to acknowledge and adore Him,” &c. He, 
therefore, stretched forth His hands, and compassed the world, 
to show that from the rising to the setting sun a mighty people 
from all languages and tribes would come under His wings, and 
receive on their brows that noblest of all signs. On other points 
relating to the Cross, its various forms, its oracular answers, &c., 
see Gretser, i. 29 seq . ; S. Thomas, par . iii. Q. 46 ; and Suarez

in loe. On the Moral Cross, /.*, the patient, resolute, and firm 
endurance of all tribulations, see Gretser, lib. iv. dr Cruce. 

Tropologically : S. Chrysostom (Horn, de Cruce) thi* recounts 
its praises : “ It is the hope of Christians, the resurrection of the 
dead, the leader of the blind, the way to those in despair. It is 
the staff of the lame, the consolation of the poor, the restrainer 
of the rich, the destruction of the proud. It is the punishment 
of evil-livers, the triumph over evil spirits, the victory over the 
devil. It is the guide of the young, the support of the destitute, 
the pilot to those at sea, the harbour of those in peril, the 
bulwark of the besieged, the father of orphans, the defender of 
widows, the counsellor of the righteous, the rest of the troubled, 
the guardian of the young, the head of men, the closing act of 
the old.” And so on at great length. See, too, S. Ephr. de 
Cruce ; and S. J. Damasc. iv. 12. 

Seven holy affections (especially) should be excited by medi- 
tating on Christ crucified, — compassion, compunction, gratitude, 
imitation, hope, admiration, love and charity. 

Here comes in from S. Luke xxiii. 34 our Lord's first word on 
the Cross, “Father, forgive them,” &c. He forgets entirely the 
pains and injuries He had received, and, kindled with the glow of 
charity, prayed for their forgiveness. And He was “heard for 
His reverence” (Heb. v. 7). For many repented at S. Peter's 
preaching, and were converted to Christ at Pentecost He Him- 
self taught us to pray for our persecutors, to do good to those 
who do us wrong, and to overcome evil with good. S. Stephen, 
too, imitated His example (Acts vii 59): “They know not what 
they do.'' They know not I am the Christ the Son of God, for 
else they would not dare to commit this monstrous sacrilege, the 
murder of God. They know not that I am the Saviour of the 
world, and that I am dying for their salvation. “ So does the 
gentleness and tenderness of Christ triumph over the cruelty and 
malice of the Jews " (de Passione apud S. Cyprian ). 

The flint is the emblem of the love of our enemies, and has 
this motto, “ Fire comes from flint, but not without a blow.” The

flint is popularly called a “living stone” from the living fire 
within. The flint, then, here is Christ, the corner-stone. For He 
poured forth on the Cross the latent fire of His Godhead and 
His boundless charity. But yet not without a blow, for it was 
while smitten by His persecutors that He prayed for them so 
ardently. He had Himself said before, “1 came to send fire 
upon the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled?” (Luke 
xii. 49). Let the Christian, then, imitate Christ, and make himself 
a flint, which is full of fire itself, and ignites others; and when 
he is wrongfully smitten, let him shoot forth sparks of Divine 
love, as Christ did against His smiters. 

They parted His garments , casting lots . S. John relates this 

more fully (xix. 23). S. Cyril observes on this, “They claim the 
garments as being theirs by the law of inheritance, as the reward 
for their services.” S. Chrysostom says also, “This was generally 
done in the case of mean and utterly destitute criminals.” And 
again, “ They part those garments wherewith miracles were 
wrought. But at that time they wrought none since Christ did 
not display His unspeakable power.” It was a great affront and 
distress to Christ to see His garments insolently tom by the 
soldiers before His very eyes, and divided by casting lots. But 
He doubtless wished to die and suffer for us in the utmost poverty, 
in nakedness and disgrace, and to lay aside not merely His gar- 
ments, but also His body and His life; that so His ignominy 
might clothe and hide the ignominy both of our and Adam's 
nakedness, and restore to us thereby the garments of immortality ; 
“that He might clothe us with immortality and life” ([Pseudo-] 
Athanasius, de Cruce ). 

Tropologically : He would teach us to strip off the superfluities 
of this world. 

Now, here observe Christ had a coat without seam. It was 
a kind of under-garment, worn next to the body, says Euthymius. 
And he adds, approvingly, that it was woven for Him (as ancient 
writers held) when a child by the Blessed Virgin. If so, it 
appears to have grown with His growth, like the garments of the

THE SEAMLESS COAT. 293 

Hebrews in the wilderness. It is religiously preserved, and is to 
be seen at Treves. 

Symbolically: [Pseudo-] Athanasius says, This coat was without 
seam, “that the Jews might believe who and whence He was 
who ware it; that He was the Word, who came not from earth 
but from Heaven; that He was the inseparable Word of the 
Father; and that when made man He had a body fashioned of 
the Virgin alone by the grace of the Spirit.” And again, “This 
was not their doing, but that of the Saviour as He hung on the 
Cross. He spoiled principalities, and led the devil captive, and 
terrified the soldiers so that they rent not the coat, but that as 
long as it remained it might be a standing testimony against the 
Jews. For the veil was rent, but not the coat, no not even by 
the soldiers, but remained entire. For the Gospel ever remains 
entire when the shadows pass away.” The soldiers rent Christ’s 
other garments, and divided them into four parts for the four 
soldiers who crucified Him, and they again cast lots what each 
should take. It is supposed He had three garments, the seamless 
coat, another one over it like a soutane , and the upper coat, which 
covered the whole body. 

Symbolically: [Pseudo-] Athanasius says, “They divided His 
garments into four parts, because He wore them for the sins of 
the four quarters of the world. And when the Baptist saw Him 
clothed therein, he said, ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which 
taketh away the sins of the world.’ ” 

Ver. 36. And sitting down they watched Him there . They 

watched Him lest His disciples should take Him away, or lest 
He should miraculously descend. But in the Divine counsels it 
was for another purpose, which they knew not For, as S. Jerome 
says, “ The watchfulness of the soldiers and of the priests was for 
our benefit, as manifesting more fully the power of His resurrec- 
tion.” For they saw Him dying on the Cross, and after He had 
been seen again alive, would be obliged to confess that He had 
risen by Divine power.

(Syr. the occasion of His death), This is ' the King of the Jeivs. 
They put up a board inscribed with the reason of His crucifixion, 
that He had set up to be a King. And, consequently, the chief 
priests suggested that Pilate should not write, “The King of the 
Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the Jews” (John xix. 
21). Pilate refused, for he and the Jews meant the same thing. 
But God guided his hand, and he wrote, in another and truer 
sense, “This is the King of the Jews,” *.*, the Messiah or Christ 
This inscription, then, conferred on Christ the highest honour, 
for it set forth not only His innocence, but also His dignity, that 
He was indeed the very Christ, the Redeemer of the world It 
therefore convicts and condemns the Jews as His murderers, since 
it was they who compelled Pilate to crucify Him. Pilate, then, 
by this very title reproaches them with it, avenges himself on 
them for their obstinate importunity, and holds them up to 
general infamy. For he knew well that Jesus was the Messiah, 
the desire and expectation of all people. Hence Origen says, 
“This title adorns the head of Jesus as a crown.” And Bede, 
dwelling on the words “over His head,” says, “Though He was 
in the weakness of a man suffering for us on the Cross, yet did 
He shine forth with regal majesty above the Cross.” For it was 
made known that He was even now beginning to “reign from 
the tree.” Pilate accordingly refused to alter the title. And by 
this is signified, mystically, that while the Jews remained in their 
obstinate unbelief, Gentiles, such as Pilate, would acknowledge and 
worship Him as their King and Saviour. 

Observe, i. A title, declaring the cause of their death, used to be 
placed over the head of malefactors. It is hence inferred that the 
cross was not T-shaped, but with an upper limb to carry the title. 

2. No one Evangelist fully sets out the title ; but on comparing 
them all, it is concluded to have been, “Jesus of Nazareth, the 
King of the Jews.” 

This title still exists in the Church of S. Croce at Rome, though 
much mutilated. Bosius (de Cruet Triumph, L n) gives an exact 
copy of it as it was when he wrote.

THE TWO THIEVES. 


205 

Ver. 38. Then were there crucified (with the like spikes and nails, 
says Nonnus, on John xix. 19) two thieves , one on the right hand 
and another on the left. The cross was the punishment of such 
criminals, and Christ, as placed between them, seemed to be 
their chief and leader, exactly as the Jews wished, in ordei to 
dishonour Him. But God overthrew and turned back on them 
all their artifices. For, as S. Chrysostom says, “The devil wished 
to hide the matter, but could not” For though three were cruci- 
fied, Jesus only was the distinguished one, to show that all 
proceeded from His power; for the miracles which took place 
were attributed to no one but Jesus. Thus were the devices of 
the devil frustrated, and recoiled on his own head; for even of 
these two one was saved. Thus, then, so far from marring the 
glory of the Cross, he greatly increased it. For it was as great 
a matter for the thief to be converted on the Cross, and to enter 
Paradise, as for the rocks to be rent 

Symbolically; Christ between the thieves represents the last 
judgment, with the elect on his right hand and the wicked on 
His left So S. Ambrose (in Luke xxiii.); and S. Augustine 
{Tract, xxxi. in S. John) says, “The Cross, mark it well, was 
a judgment-seat, for the Judge, being between them, he who 
believed was set free, the other was condemned, signifying the 
judgment of the quick and dead.” 

Ver. 39. And they that passed by blasphemed Him , wagging 
their heads . All their revilings and insults were blasphemies, 

as being against the Son of God. “They blasphemed the Holy 
One of Israel,” Isa. i. 4, and Ps. xxii. 8. This was a greater 
torment even than the crucifixion. Whence it is said (Ecclus. 
vii. 11), “Laugh not at a man in the bitterness of his soul.” And 
Christ complains (Ps. lxix. 26), “They persecute Him whom Thou 
hast smitten, and added to the pain of My wounds ; ” and (Ps. xxii. 
13), “They gaped upon Me,” &c., so great was their cruelty.

it up in three days ! Show that Thou canst do it by setting 
Thyself free from the cross. If Thou canst not do this small 
matter, how canst Thou do that greater work on the temple, 
that vast building ? 

Ver. 41. Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him, with the 
scribes and elders , said . These were more fierce than the people 
against Christ, for they jest at His miracles, as though wrought 
not by the power of God, but by Beelzebub; or certainly as 
not real, but imaginary. For had they been wrought by God, 
He would certainly have delivered Him from the Cross. But 
His not doing it was a sign that He was an impostor. “For 
they wished Him to die as a Boastful and arrogant deceiver,” 
says S. Chrysostom, “and to be reviled in the sight of all 
men," that they might thus utterly stamp out His name and 
sect, so that no one might afterwards follow his teaching, or 
reverence and preach Him as the Messiah. 

If Thou be the King of Israel . The King of the Jews, that 

is, the Messiah. “What is the connection here?” says S. Bernard 

(Serm. L in Pasch.); “that He should descend from the Cross, if 
He be the King of Israel, and not rather go up on it? Hast thou, 
then, so entirely forgotten, O Jew, that ‘the Lord hath reigned 
from the tree, 1 as to say, ‘ He is not King, because He remains 
on it* Nay, rather, because He is the King of Israel let Him 

not abandon the royal title, let Him not lay down the rod 

of empire, for His government is upon His shoulder. If Pilate 
hath written what he hath written, shall not Christ complete 
that which He hath begun?” He goes on to say, “This is 
clearly the craft of the serpent, the invention of spiritual wicked- 
ness. The evil one knew His zeal for the salvation of that 
people, and therefore most maliciously did he teach these blas- 
phemers to say, ‘Let Him descend, and we will believe,’ as 
though there were now no obstacle to His descending, since 
He so earnestly desired that they should believe. But He, as 
knowing all hearts, is not moved by their worthless profession. 
For their malicious suggestion tended not only to their un-

belief, but to our own utter loss of faith in Him. For if we 
read, ‘Perfect are all the works of God* (Deut. xxxii. 14), how 
could we even believe in Him as God if He had left the 
work of salvation unfinished?” He adds a further reason, “To 
give him no opportunity of stealing from us our perseverance, 
which alone is crowned ; and that preachers should not be 
silenced when they exhort the feeble-minded not to abandon 
their post For this would be the sure result if they were able 
to reply that Christ had abandoned His. 

Let Him come down from the cross . Christ, though able to do 
so, was unwilling to descend when thus taunted, because it 
was the Father’s command that He should die on the Cross 
for our redemption. He despised, therefore, their reproaches, 
to teach us to do the same. So Theophylact (on Mark xv.) 
observes, “Had He been willing to descend, He would not 
have ascended at alL But knowing that men were to be saved 
by this means, He submitted to be crucified.” “He wished 
not,” said Origen, “to do any unworthy act, because He was 
jested at, or to do their bidding against reason and due order.” 
And S. Augustine ( Tract xxxvii. on S. John\ “Because He was 
teaching patience, He deferred a display of His power. For 
had He descended, it would seem as though He had given 
way to their cutting reproaches.” And again, “He deferred 
the exercise of His power, because He wished not to descend 
from the Cross, though able to rise from the grave. But yet He 
manifested His compassion, for while hanging on the Cross He 
said, ‘ Father, forgive them,’ &c.” 

Lastly, S. Gregory {Horn. xxi. in Evang.) says, “ Had He then 
come down from the Cross, as yielding to their insults, He would 
not have exhibited the virtue of patience. But He waited awhile, He 
endured their reproaches and derision, He maintained His patience, 
He deferred their astonishment, and though He had refused to 
descend from the Cross, yet He rose from the tomb. And this, in* 
deed, was a much greater matter ; greater, indeed, to destroy death 
by rising again, than to save life by descending from the Cross.”

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


And we will believe Him to be the Messiah. They spake 
falsely, for they who beiieved Him not when He raised 
others, would assuredly not have believed Him had He freed 
Himself from death. They would have said that He had 
descended in appearance only. S. Jerome calls this promise of 
theirs a “fraudulent one; for which is greater, to descend when 
alive from the Cross, or to rise again from the grave? He rose 
again, and ye believed not, and were He even to descend from 
the Cross, ye would, in like manner, believe not” Just as 
heretics now say, We would believe the saints if they wrought 
miracles; but when their miracles are adduced, they cavil at 
them as pretended or imaginary. 

Ver. 43. He trusted in God , let Him deliver Him , if He will 
have Him (Arab., if He loved Him), for He said \ I am the 
Son of God . They used the very words of David (Ps. xxii. 8), 
thus testifying that they were the very persons who were fore- 
told, and that Jesus was the true Messiah, for the whole Psalm 
speaks of Him. When a man is in the agony of death, all 
human hope is gone. Confidence in God alone remains, and 
of this, His last stay, they try to deprive Him. Thou hast 
vainly put Thy trust in God. Thou hast said falsely that Thou 
art the Son of God. If He loved Thee, He would set Thee 
free. But as He will not, Thou art clearly not His Son, but an 
odious impostor. Thus do they revile and seek to drive Him 
to despair, as the devil who assails men in their last agony. 
But how fallacious was their* argument ! For God, as specially 
loving Christ, wished Him to die on the Cross, that He might 
afterwards glorify Him in His resurrection, and by Him save 
many souls. Now Christ knew all this. He heeded not their 
revilings, but fixed all His hope on God, and thereby gained 
from Him both of these great ends. He poured forth accordingly, 
after all these insults, fresh acts of confidence in God, teach- 
ing us to do the like. “Thou art He that took Me out 
of My mother’s womb,” &c. (Ps. xxii. 10). And so, too, 
the Martyrs used to say that God would not deliver them, in

order that He might give them a better life, and the crown of 
martyrdom. 

The Wise Man, speaking in their person, foretold all these insults 
(Wisd. ii. 13), and then added, “Such thoughts had they, and were 
in error,” &c. 

Tropologically : Sinners utter reproaches against Christ when 
they dishonour Him by their sins. S. Bernard ( Rhythm on 
Passion) makes Him thus tenderly appeal to them : 

u ’Tis I who die for thee, to thee who cry, 

Thee I exhort on Cross uplifted high ; 

Tis I who bare for thee, and open wide 
The cruel spear-wound in My sacred side } 

My inward and My outward pains are great, 

But sadder far to find thee thus Migrate.” 

Zechariah (xiii. 6) speaks of His being wounded in the house of 
His friends. 

Ver. 44. The thieves also which were crucified with Him uttered 
against Him the like reproach. The Greek Fathers, and S. 
Hilary among the Latins, think it probable that both the thieves 
blasphemed Christ at first, but that one of them afterwards 
repented. But the Latin Fathers consider that the plural is here, 
by synecdoche, put for the singular. “ Thieves,” i.e., “ one of the 
thieves” (as Luke xxiii. 36, “the soldiers,” meaning one of them); 
S. Matthew wishing by the word thieves to point out not so 
much the persons of the thieves, as the condition of those who 
insulted Christ; all vying in insulting Him, even the thief at 
His side. S. Luke (xxiii. 40) gives the story of the other thief 
(see Comment in loc.). 

Here comes in the third word on the Cross, “Woman, behold 
thy Son,” &c. (see John xix. 26, and the notes thereon). 

Ver. 45. But from the sixth hour there was darkness over the 
whole earth unto the ninth hour , From mid-day, till 3 p.m., 
which is usually the brightest part of the day. This darkness was 
supernatural; as though the sun and the whole heavens were 
veiled in black, as bewailing the ignominious death of Christ

their Lord. So S. Jerome and S. Cyprian {de Bono Patient.) ; and 
S. Chrysostom {in Catena ), “The creature could not bear the 
wrong done to its Creator, and the sun withdrew his rays, that 
he might not see the evil doings of the wicked.” 

Again, it took place at full moon. It lasted much longer than 
an ordinary eclipse; it was total, the light of the moon as well as 
of the sun being withdrawn, the stars being seen, and so on. 

Over the whole earth. Of Judaea, say Origen and Maldonatus. 
Others, more correctly (as S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others), 
over the whole world. Dionysius, the Areopagite, is said to have 
exclaimed at the time, “ Either the God of Nature (or, as otherwise 
quoted, *an Unknown God’) is suffering, or the fabric of the world 
is being dissolved.” He was afterwards converted by S. Paul’s 
preaching Christ at Athens as the Unknown God. This, then, was 
a token of Christ’s Godhead; for when the sun, the eye of the 
world, was obscured and dying out, it signified that Christ, its God 
and Lord, the Sun of Righteousness, was dying on the Cross, and 
that sun and moon and all the elements were bewailing Him in 
His agony. 

Symbolically : This darkness signified the blinding of the Jews. 
So S. Chrysostom {de Cruce), Darkness is to this very day upon 
them; but with us night is turned into day. For it is the 
property of godliness to shine in the darkness ; but ungodliness, 
though in the light, is in darkness still. Night is for believers 
turned into day, but for unbelievers their very light is darkness. 
It is said of believers, “ Their darkness is no darkness, and their 
night shall be clear as the day” (Ps. cxxxix. n); but for un- 
believers even the day is turned into night, for “ they shall grope 
for the wall as the blind” (Isa. lx. io), “they will walk in mid- 
day as in the night” (Job v. 14). 

Ver. 46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , 
sayings Eli) Eli) lama Sabachthani ? that is to say, My God , My 
God, why hast Thou forsaken Mel quoting Ps. xxii. 1. “Sabach- 
thani ” is Syriac, not Hebrew. 

He was indeed continually praying on the Cross, and offering

CALVIN’S IMPIOUS OPINION.

Himself wholly to God for man’s salvation. But as his death 
was drawing near He recited this Psalm, which throughout speaks 
of His Passion, to show that He was the very person there spoken 
of, and that the Jews might thus learn the reason why He refused 
to descend from the Cross, viz., because the Father had decreed 
that He should die for the salvation of men ; as David had there 
foretold. 

Calvin says impiously that these were the words of Christ in 
despair, for that He was obliged to experience the full wrath of 
God which our sins deserve, and even the sufferings of the lost, 
of which despair is one. But this blasphemy refutes itself. For 
if he despaired on the Cross, He sinned most grievously. He 
therefore did not satisfy, but rather enflamed, the wrath of God. 
And how can it be said that Christ ever despaired, when He 
said shortly afterwards, w Father, into Thy hands I commend My 
spirit ” ? Christ therefore does not cry out as being forsaken by 
the Godhead and hypostatic union of the Word, nor even by the 
grace and love of God, but only because the Father did not 
rescue Him from instant death, nor soothe in any way His cruel 
sufferings, but permitted Him to endure unmitigated tortures. 
And all this was to show how bitter was His death on the Cross, 
the rending asunder of His soul and body with such intense pain 
as to lead Him to pray in His agony and bloody sweat, ** Father, 
if it be possible,” &c. So S. Jerome, S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, 
and other Fathers; nor do S. Hilary and S. Ambrose mean any- 
thing else in saying, “ The man cried aloud when dying at being 
separated from the Godhead.” For they mean not a severing of 
essence and of the hypostatical union, but of support and con- 
solation. For the faith teaches us that though the soul of Christ 
was separated from His body, yet the Godhead remained as before, 
hypostatically united both to His soul and His body. Besides 
this, Christ complained of His desertion, because the Godhead 
withheld Its succour, solely to keep Him still suffering, and to 
prolong His life for greater endurances ; nay, rather to augment 
His pain when He saw Himself, though in union with Godhead,

enduring such atrocious indignities (see S. L. Justinian i, de Triumph. 
A gone Christy cap . viii.). 

Symbolically; Christ here inquires why He was thus forsaken. 

What have I done that 1 should die on this Cross? I am most 

innocent, the Saint of Saints. He gives His own answer. “Far 

off from My salvation are the words of My sins” (Ps. xxii. i), 

meaning thereby, “The sins of men, whose expiation the Father 
hath put on Me, these are they which take away My life, and 
bring Me to the death of the Cross.” But some (see Theophylact) 
consider that He is here speaking not of His own desertion, but 
of that of the Jewish people. 

Origen thinks He is complaining of the fewness of those who 
will be saved, and the multitude of the lost, in whom the fruit of 
His Passion comes to nought. Why forsakest Thou My kinsmen 
in the flesh, for whom I am dying? Why savest Thou the few 
and rejectest the many ? For in so doing Thou forsakest Myself ; 
for thou makest the fruit of My suffering to perish. 

Tropologically : [Arnold apud] Cyprian (de Passione) thinks He 
spoke thus in order that we should inquire why He was lorsaken. 
“He was forsaken,” he says, “that we should not be forsaken; 
that we should be set free from our sins and eternal death; to 
manifest His love to us; to display His righteousness and com- 
passion ; to draw our love towards Him ; lastly, to set before us 
an example of patience.” The way to Heaven is open, but it is 
arduous and difficult He wished to precede us with His wondrous 
example, that the way might not terrify us, but that the stupendous 
example of God in suffering might urge us on to say exultingly 
with S. Paul, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” 

This, then, His fourth word on the Cross, is a consolation to all 
who are desolate and afflicted. He consoled in this way S. Peter 
Martyr when falsely accused. The Saint complained to Christ 
(he was kneeling before the crucifix) that he had kept silence, 
and not defended him. Christ replied, “What wrong had I done 
to be crucified for thee on this Cross ? Learn patience from Me, 
for all thy sufferings cannot equal Mine.” The Saint on this was

so strengthened that he wished to endure still further suffering. 
And therefore Christ at length established his innocence, and 
turned all his disgrace into glory (see Surius , April 29). 

Ver. 47. Some of them that stood there, when they heard that , 
said. This man calleth for Elias . According to S. Jerome and 

others, these were the Roman soldiers, who also gave Him vinegar 
(Luke xxiii. 36). But not understanding Hebrew, they thought 
He called for Elias, of whose return at Christ’s coming they had 
heard from the Jews. 

Ver. 48. And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, 
and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to 
drink . All these were ready at hand, for the drink used to be 
given to those who were crucified. They did this as soon as 
Jesus had cried, “I thirst” (John xix. 28), His fifth word on the 
Cross. The sponge was for Christ to suck out the vinegar, as 
they could not lift a cup to His lips. The sponge is preserved 
in St. John’s Lateran. Wine was usually given to those who were 
crucified, to quench their thirst, and strengthen them to bear their 
tortures. But the Jews (and the soldiers to gratify the Jews’ 
hatred to Christ) offered Him vinegar instead (Ps. lxix. 22). De 
Lyra says (quoting Prov. xxxi. 6) that devout women used to 
prepare wine flavoured with spices, but that the Jews on this 
occasion took it away, and put in its stead vinegar mingled with 
gall. 

Now they gave it Him in mockery, to give Him pain by the 
bitterness of the draught; to increase and not to quench His 
thirst, this being the property of vinegar. Baronius thinks it was 
given to keep ' Him alive, and thus prolong His suffering ; 
Theophylact, Caietan, and others, that it was to hasten His death. 
“ For vinegar has malignant properties,” says Theophylact, “ which 
penetrates into wounds.” Thus — 

Symbolically: It signifies the malignity which the Jews, and all 
sinners, exhibit to Christ. So S. Augustine (in John xix. 29), 
“Give that which ye are yourselves.” For the Jews were as 
vinegar, in degenerating from the wine of the Patriarchs and

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVII. 


Prophets ; having a heart full of iniquity, as a vessel full of vinegar; 
and full of fraud, like a sponge, with its winding and hollow 
hiding-places. 

But Christ by drinking the vinegar converted it for us into 
wine, and by so doing gained power to turn our vices into 
virtues, our weaknesses into glory. “The wine," says S. Hilary, 
“which turned acid in Adam was the glory or might of immor- 
tality. But He drank it, and thus transfused into Himself, and into 
union with immortality, that which in us was vitiated. 1 ’ And so 
Remigius, “Vinegar means the Jews who had degenerated from 
their fathers; the sponge, their hearts full of fraud; the reed, 
Holy Scripture, which was thus fulfilled.” 

And put it on a reed. That is, the stalk of some plant S. 
John (xix. 29) says it was the stalk of the hyssop. For the 
Cross was not high, so that by stretching out the arms the 
sponge on a short stalk would easily reach Christ’s mouth. In 
Palestine the garden hyssop grows higher than in Europe, 
though on walls it grows low (1 Kings iv. 33). Sometimes it runs 
to 18 inches. 

Some suspect that for frwcfrp is to be read y<r<rp, a spear; 
a mere conjecture. Others think, with S. Augustine, that a 
sponge full of vinegar was placed on the hyssop, and then both 
of them on the reed. Others, that a sponge full of hyssop juice 
and vinegar was placed on the reed. Anyhow, the sponge was 
placed on the hyssop, whether it was itself the stalk or merely 
fastened to it 

Hyssop was given, because it is frequently used with wine and 
vinegar (see Columella, de Re Rust. xii. 35 ; and Pliny, N. H. 
xiv. 16). It has reviving, and strengthening, and other medicinal 
properties. 

Now the soldiers tied the hyssop round the sponge^ that the 
vinegar should not escape, and that Christ, taking the vinegar 
and the hyssop, might revive. 

It was used for cleansing lepers (Lev. xiv. 49), also in the 
sin-offering and in the sprinkling of the water of purification

THE LAST CfcY OF JESU&

(Num. xix. 9 iff); and was therefore a type of Christ's Blood, 
in its purifying, refreshing, and strengthening power. “It is a 
lowly Jierb,” says S. Augustine on John xix., “cleansing the 
chest, and signifies the humility of Christ, whereby we are 
cleansed." 

Ver. 49. But the rest said \ Let be , let us see whether Elias will 
come to save Him . The word “let be” is here in the singular, 
in S. Mark in the plural. In the plural it would mean, keep 
quiet, attend solely to Jesus, see whether Elias will come to save 
Him ; for they doubted whether He were really the Messiah, whose 
precursor Elias was to be. 

S. Mark says that only one soldier spoke thus, addressing the 
rest. It is supposed by S. Augustine (de Cons. Evang. iii. 17) 
and others that the word was used both by the one soldier and 
by the whole body; secondly, that the soldiers said to him that 
offered the vinegar, Wait a while, do not give it, for fear He 
should die too soon, for vinegar hastens death ; let us see 
whether Elias will come. And that he replied, Let me give 
it, lest He should die of thirst Just let Him drink it, and 
keep alive; so shall we see whether Elias will come (so Jansenius). 
Or, again, that the soldiers said to him who offered the vinegar, 
Leave Him alone, do not annoy Him. For they thought that 

Elias would come if He were left alone* but not if others were 

about Him. And that he replied, Cease your clamour, lest ye 
drive Elias away; or otherwise, Leave Him lest ye hasten His 
death (Barradi). Or, again, Suffer me to mock Him in this 
way, for the more He is molested, the more will Elias come if 
he wishes to help Him. What I am doing will not delay but 
rather hasten his coming. Or, it may be, Let me give Him the 
vinegar, for 1 shall thus kill Him, and keep Elias from saving 

Him. For all this (as S. Luke says) was done in jest and 

mockery. 

Ver. 50. But Jesus , when He had cried again with a loud voice % 
yielded up the ghost. “ Again ” refers to the former words on the 
Cross. He first cried out, and then expired. S. Luke gives the 

VOL. III. u

exact words, “ Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit” In 
the Greek, “ I will lay down My life ; I will consign it into Thy 
hands as a deposit, to take it back when I am raised up on 
the third day.” Hence the faithful use this verse when dying, 
as David first used it when in suffering (Ps. xxxi 5). 

It was by a miracle that Christ cried with a loud voice, for 
the dying lose their voice, so that they can hardly speak. For 
though S. Thomas says {par. iii. q. 47) that Christ preserved 
the vigour and strength of His body to the last; yet others 
suppose, more correctly, that His strength had so failed by what 
He had gone through, that He could not cry out naturally, but 
only by a miracle, for otherwise He would not have died 
through the violence of His sufferings, but merely by His own 
Voluntary severing of His soul and body, and thus would not 
have been slain, or have made satisfaction to His Father by His 
death of violence. 

He cried out, then, by the supernatural powers which His 
Godhead furnished. And that to signify, 1st, that He, as God, 
died not by compulsion or necessity, but of His own free will. 
As He said, “I have power to lay down My life,” &c (John 
x. 18); and that His sacrifice of Himself might clearly be 
voluntary. “He had His whole life and death,” says S. Victor 
of Antioch, “entirely in His own power.” 2nd. To show that He 
was more than man, and was God, as the Centurion exclaimed. 
3rd. To set forth His vehement love of God, His reverence, His 
obedience, and earnest desire for man’s salvation (see Heb. v. 7, 
and notes thereon). 4th. To indicate His sure and certain hope 
of His glorious resurrection on the third day (so Origen). 

Yielded up the ghost. Voluntarily. “For that which is sent 
forth (emittitur) is voluntary, that which is lost ( amittitur ) is of 
necessity,” S. Ambrose {in Luc. xxiii.) ; and S. Augustine {de 
Trin. iv. 13), “The spirit of the Mediator left not His body 
against His will, but because of it, when He willed, and as He 
willed it; for man was blended into union with the Word of 
God. Hence He says, ‘I have power,”’ &c (John x. 18).

BOWED THE HEAD. 


307 


So, too, S. Jerome, Bede, and others. Whence, also, “He 
bowed His head” (John xix. 30). “As the Lord of death,” 
says Theophylact; “for other men when dying first breathe their 
last, and then bow the head, which thus droops by its own 
weight” S. Chrysostom says this was “to show that He died 
not of necessity, but voluntarily. He lived as long as He 
willed; when He willed He gave up the ghost” A spurious 
work attributed to S. Athanasius is also quoted to the same 
effect For though His human nature sank beneath the violence 
of His pains, and He ought to have died, yet His Godhead was 
able to give it strength, and to prolong His life. That nature, 
therefore, could not die, except by permission of His Godhead. 
He therefore freely died, whether as God or man ; for His human 
nature could have asked, and would have obtained, this strength 
from His Godhead. 

Observe, He died at the ninth hour, the very hour when Adam \ 
sinned, and to expiate his sin. The same hour also when the 
Paschal Lamb was slain, and the Jews offered the daily sacri- 
fice. And this to show that He thus fulfilled all these types in 
His death. Whence the ninth hour is the Christian’s hour of 
prayer. 

Symbolically and Morally: He bowed His head, as bearing the 
burden of all men’s sins, sin being the heaviest of all burdens ; to 
mark His obedience, thus teaching “ religious ” persons, and those 
under authority, to obey those over them (conf. Phil. ii. 8) ; to 
humble Himself before the Father, to do Him reverence, and to 
submit His own will to His, even to the death of the Cross; to 
bid farewell to the world, especially to Italy and the West, for His 
head, as we have said, was turned towards Italy, which He wished 
to make illustrious by His faith, and by the Pontificate and 
martyrdom of SS. Peter and Paul ; to bid farewell to His Mother ; 
to mark the spot where the spear was to pierce Him ; to show 
that He and His Father were by His Passion reconciled to men. 

60 S. Augustine (de Virg.) says, “ Behold His wounds when hang- 
ing, His Blood when dying, His value when dying, His scars when

rising, His head bent down to kiss, His heart opened to love, His 
arms extended to embrace, His whole body exposed to redeem,” 
&c. It was, again, to show that His soul would descend below, 
and set the Patriarchs* free; to manifest His compassion. “He 
made His head to melt,” says Laur. Justiniani ( de Triumph . A gone, 
wp. xx.), “to show compassion; He bent down to display His 
grace ; He bowed it to show forgiveness ; ” again, to manifest His 
love for S. John, the Magdalen, and others like them who were 
standing by, and to turn away from those who shrank from the 
Cross; to look away (again) from the title on the Cross, as 
declining, and teaching us to decline, all worldly sovereignty and 
pomp; to show that His death, as He was to rise on the third 
day, was rather sleep than death; for they who sleep bow the 
head, “I will lay me down in peace,” &c. (Ps. iv. 8). Lastly, 
having fulfilled His mission, He asks, as it were, His Father's 
blessing and permission to depart from the world. He seems to 
say, I have finished My course, I have done and suffered for man’s 
salvation all Thou commandest. Permit Me to die, and return 
to Thee. And I ask, too, according to Thy promise (Ps. ii. 8), 
that all nations may be converted and saved by My Passion and 
death. I have done Thy bidding, fulfil Thou Thy word. “Re- 
ligious” persons and Priests, in like manner, when their mission 
is done, return to their Superiors, bow the head, and ask their 
blessing, and their former rank and position. S. Bernard 
pointedly says, in a moral sense, “What avails it to follow Christ 
if Thou canst not come up with Him? For S. Paul said, ‘So 
run that ye may attain.’ Fix the limits of thy course where 
Christ fixed His. ‘ He became obedient even unto death.* 
However far thou hast run, if thou hast not gone as far as unto, 
death, thou wilt not win the prize.” 

Ver. 51. And behold the veil of the temple was rent in tivain 
from the top to the bottom . At the death of Christ the Creator 
the whole Creation was agitated with indignation. S. Augustine 
(de Cons . Evang. iii. 19) observes that the veil was rent imme- 
diately on His death, to show that it was on account of it S.

THE VEIL RENT. 


309 


Luke, therefore, who connects it with the darkness which took 
place before His death, speaks by anticipation. Now there were 
two veils, one before the Holy of Holies, the other before the 
Holy Place, which the priests entered every day. But the Holy 
of Holies the Chief Priest alone entered, and once only in the 
year. Some consider that the outer veil was rent (S. Jerome, Ep. 
cL ad Hedibiam ). But it was clearly the inner one. (See S. Leo, 
Serm. x. de Pass . ; S. Cyril, in John xix. ; Euthymius and others.) 
But why was it rent ? S. Cyril, Theophylact, and Euthymius say 
to show that the temple was indignant that the Priests, who should 
have been the first to acknowledge Christ, had denied and slain 
Him. And that it thus foretold, and threatened, as it were, that 
they were to be deprived of their Priesthood (S. Leo, Serm, x. de 
Pass,). 

Mystically : Theophylact says it was to signify that the temple 
was to be profaned, and done away with, and set aside, with all 
its rites and sacrifices (nay, more, says S. Chrysostom, “ to be laid 
waste”). God in this way made it manifest,” says Theophylact, 
“that the grace of the Holy Spirit was flying away from the 
temple, and that the Holy of Holies (before inaccessible) was 
brought within view of all.” “For then,” says S. Cyril (xii. 27 on 
John), “ Israel fell utterly away from the grace of God when it so 
madly and impiously slew its Saviour.” And S. Hilary, “The 
glory of the veil was taken away, and the protection of the guardian 
angel” Hence S. Ephr. (Serm. de Pass.) records that when it 
was rent asunder, a dove, the type of the Holy Spirit, flew out of 
the temple. 

Allegorically : To signify that the veil of legal ceremonies was 
thrown open, as fulfilled in Christ, so that henceforth both Jews 
and Gentiles should clearly know God, and Christ, and His 
Mysteries, which the Jews figuratively shadowed forth in so many 
ways; nay, more, that the service and Church of God should be 
transferred from Jerusalem, and the temple to the Gentiles and to 
Rome. So Origen, S. Jerome, S. Ambrose, and others. S. Leo 
says (Serm. xvii. de Pass.) % “ There was then so clear a change

made from the Law to the Gospel, from the Synagogue to the 
Church, from the many sacrifices to the One Victim, God Himself, 
that when our Lord gave up the ghost the veil was violently and 
suddenly rent asunder.” And S. Jerome, “The veil of the temple 
was rent, and all the mysteries of the Law, which before were 
kept secret, were then laid open, and handed over to the 
Gentiles.” 

Anagogically : S. Paul says (Heb. ix.) that the way to Heaven, 
was then opened ; for the Holy of Holies was a type of Heaven, 
and the veil signified that it was closed till Christ burst through 
it by His death. S. Jerome mentions that the huge lintel of the 
temple was then broken (Epist. cl). But Josephus says that it 
was at the destruction of Jerusalem. 

And the earth did quake . i. That is, the whole earth, as the 
darkness (ver. 45) was universal. Many authorities are quoted for 
this. Didymus (in Catena ) says it was prophesied by Job (ix. 6). 
Both Pliny and Suetonius speak of a great earthquake in Asia 
at this time. By this earthquake was indicated the Godhead of 
Christ, for He it was who shook the earth, earthquakes being fre- 
quently ascribed to divine power, e.g., 1 Kings xix. 11 ; Ex. xix. ; 
Ps. xviii. 7 ; Nahum iii. 6. In the Passion, then, of Christ, is 
fulfilled the prophecy of Hag. ii. 6. 

2. It signified the natural indignation of the earth at the awful 
crime committed against its Lord. 

Mystically: It signified the new heavens and earth (Isa. lxv. 17), 
for the old earth seemed to be passing away. 

Tropologically : It signified that the earthly and stony hearts of 
men would be moved to repentance by the death of Christ, since 
the earth, the sea, the sun, and the heavens, the darkened air, and 
the rivenrocks, proclaimed their indignation at the death of their 
Creator. But see here how Christ, in His lowliest estate, mani- 
fested His supreme majesty and power, that He might not seem 
to be compelled to die, and that men, learning who and how 
mighty He was, who was suffering for them such vile indignities 
with such great dignity, might be astounded and awe-struck. For,

THE EARTHQUAKE. 


311 

as S. Ambrose says (de Fide, v. 2), “Jesus was wearied by His 
journey, that He might refresh the wearied; He asks for drink, 
though about to give spiritual drink to those who thirsted for it ; 
He is hungry, though about to give the food of life to the hungry ; 
He dies, though about to quicken ; He is buried, though about to 
rise again; He hangs on the trembling tree, though about to 
strengthen the trembling; He covers the heaven with darkness, 
that He may illuminate it ; He shakes the earth, in order to make 
it firm; He lifteth up the sea, that He may calm it; He unbars 
the tombs of the dead, to show that they are the abodes of the 
living ; He is fashioned of a Virgin, that He may be believed to 
be the Son of God ; He assumes ignorance, that He may instruct 
the ignorant ; He is said to worship as a Jew, to the end that He 
may be worshipped as indeed the Son of God.” 

And the rocks rent First in Golgotha. Whence S. Cyril 
Hieros. says (Catech. xiii.), “Up to this day Golgotha bears its 
witness, where on Christ’s account the rocks were rent.” And 
S. Lucian, too, giving a reason for His faith to the Governor, says, 
“With these, too, agree the very spot at Jerusalem, and the rock 
of Golgotha, which was burst asunder by the weight of the Cross.” 
Adrichomius ( Descr . Jerus. num. 252) speaks more fully: “There 
can be seen even now the fissure which was made at Christ’s 
death, and also the stain of His Blood,” and then describes 
at length its size, &c. But in many other places besides, says 
Baronius (ad An. 34, num . 107), the rocks were rent, as at Mount 
Alvemo, where it was revealed to S. Francis that this took place 
at the crucifixion. He had accordingly a great devotion to the 
place, and he there received the Stigmata. S. Ambrose therefore 
justly exclaims, “O breasts of the Jews ! harder than rocks, for the 
rocks were rent, but their hearts were hardened,” &c. 

Allegorically: S. Jerome (ad Hedib. q. 8), “The rocks were rent, 
that is, the hard hearts or rocks of the Gentiles; the universal 
predictions, too, of the Prophets (who, as well as the Apostles, 
were termed rocks, by the Rock which is Christ), that whatever 
was concealed in them by the hard covering of the Law might

be rent open and revealed to the Gentiles. The tombs also (of 
whom it was written that they were as whited sepulchres) were 
rent, that they who were dead in unbelief might come forth; 
might live with Christ who had risen ; might enter the Heavenly 
Jerusalem, and have their citizenship no longer on earth, but in 
Heaven; might die with the earthly, to reign with the Heavenly 
Adam.” Eusebius mentions that at Paxos a voice was heard, 
“ Great Pan is dead,” which he explains of Lucifer, whom Christ 
destroyed by His own death. Others say that Pan was Christ, 
being “ our God and all,” and that the devils bewailed His death, 
because they were thereby despoiled of their dominion over the 
world. 

Ver. 52. And the graves were opened \ and many bodies of the 
saints which slept arose . This was immediately on Christ's death 
(as S. Matthew implies), to signify that it was wrought by the 
power of His Passion, and consequently that by the same power 
death was overcome, and life restored to mankind. So Bede, 
Theophylact, and S. Jerome, who says, “The graves were opened 
in token of the future resurrection.” So, too, S. Ambrose {cap. 
x. on Luke). And S. Hilary says, “Illumining the darkness of 
death, and lighting up the gloom of the pit, He robbed death 
of its spoils, in order to the resurrection of the dead who are 
now asleep.” But yet they came not forth from their graves till 
after Christ's resurrection (see ver. 53). For S. Paul terms Christ 
“the first-born from the dead” (Col i. 18), and “the first-fruits 
of them that rise again” (1 Cor. xv. 20). For Christ by His 
death procured resurrection both for Himself and for us. It was 
therefore but right that, when He had overcome death, He should 
be the first to rise as its conqueror, and others after Him. (Sc 
Origen, S. Jerome, and Bede.) 

They rose, then, that Christ might confirm the truth of His 
resurrection, by those His companions who announced it; and, 
again, that in and through them Christ might manifest the power 
of His Passion ; that just as the souls of the Patriarchs were freed 
by it from the pit, so, mystically, would men’s souls, which were

THE SLEEPING SAINTS ARISE. 313 

dead in sin, be now quickened by His grace, and themselves 
rise gloriously at last to a blessed and eternal life. 

Did, then, these saints die again after their resurrection, or 
continue in life and glory? Some think they did die, and are 
to rise again at the last day, and this from S. Paul’s words, “ That 
they without us should not be made perfect” (See S. Augustine, 
Epist. xcix. ad Evodium.) Others suppose, and more correctly, 
that they died no more, but were raised up to life immortal Be- 
cause it was but fitting that Christ should manifest at once in their 
resurrection the power of His own. It was also meet that happy 
souls like these should be united only to glorious and immortal 
bodies. But their happiness would have been but brief, and their 
misery greater, if they had died again so speedily. It would have 
been better, indeed, if they had not risen at all It was also but 
fitting that they should adorn Christ’s triumphant ascension, as cap- 
tives redeemed by Him, and the spoils He had won from death ; 
and, lastly, that He should have them with Him in Heaven, and 
that His human nature, enjoying their presence and society, might 
never be solitary and void of human consolation. So Origen, S. 
Jerome, S. Clemens Alex. ( Strom. . lib. vi.), and others. The words 
“without us” do not refer to the day of judgment, but to the 
resurrection of Christ and Christians. (See notes on Heb. xi. 40.) 

But it is not clear who these saints were. Probably those, in 
the first place, who were specially connected with Christ, either by 
kindred, or promise, or type and figure, or by faith and hope, or 
else by chastity and holiness ; as Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Mel- 
chisedek, David, who wished to be buried in the promised land, 
and thus be partakers of Christ’s resurrection. Job, also, and 
Jonah, as types of the resurrection; Moses, Joshua, Samuel, 
Isaiah, and the other Prophets. Daniel, also, and his three 
companions (though their bodies are at Rome). Eve, also (some 
suppose), as well as Adam, though Lorinus considers that the , 
Blessed Virgin was the first woman raised from the grave, as 
Christ Himself was the first-fruits among men. Those, also, who 
died but recently ; as Zacharias, Simeon, S. John the Baptist

(though his head is shown at Rome and Amiens, his finger at 
Florence). Raymundus also (lib. de Bono Latront , cap. xiii.) 
mentions the penitent thief, though S. Augustine (contr. Felician % 
cap. xv.) says, but only by the way, that he was reserved for the 
future resurrection. There were also many more (especially those 
mentioned in Heb. xi.) outside Judaea, for “many bodies of the 
saints arose.” For it was indeed quite in harmony with the 
profuse magnificence of Christ that a crowded procession of the 
saints who then arose should dignify His resurrection and 
ascension. 

Tropologically : This, says S. Jerome, “is a type of believers, 
who once, like the graves of the dead, have forsaken their sins, 
and whose hard hearts have been softened to acknowledge their 
Creator, and who have risen through penitence to a life of grace.” 

Went into the Holy City . Jerusalem, so called because of the 
temple worship, of the many saints who had been there, and of 
the institution of the Church therein by Christ the King of Saints. 

And appeared unto many. To the Apostles, and disciples, and 
also to the Jews, to persuade them to believe in the resurrection. 
“That by their resurrection,” says Euthymius, “others might be 
the more assured, by considering that He who had raised them 
had much more surely raised Himself.” 

Now when the centurion , &c. Baronius and others suppose that 
this was Longinus, to whose keeping Pilate had consigned Christ 
He was converted by the miracles he had seen, and became a 
witness and preacher of the resurrection. He is said to have 
retired to Cappadocia, and there to have been martyred by the 
Jews (see Surius , March 15). Lucius Dexter, a writer of small 
authority, considers it was C. Oppius, a Spaniard, afterwards 
the third Bishop of Milan (see Cornelius, Procem. in Acta ad fin.). 

Saw the earthquake f and those things that were done , they feared 
greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God. God enlightened 
him to acknowledge from wbat he had seen that Jesus was more 
than man, and God indeed. He had heard that He had been 
condemned for calling Himself the King of the Jews. But when

THE CENTURION'S CONFESSION.

he saw that God had borne witness to Him by these many 
miracles, he acknowledged that He had spoken truly. It was 
thus God’s will that the Centurion should bear unquestionable 
witness to Christ (S. Hilary). S. Augustine thinks that he con- 
fessed Him to be the Son of God not in a natural, but only in a 
spiritual sense, as a righteous and holy man (Luke xxiii. 47). 
But others, more correctly, that he confessed Him to be the Son 
of God by nature. So S. Jerome, “Consider that the Centurion 
in the very scandal of the Passion confessed Him to be truly the 
Son of God, and that Arius proclaims Him a creature ; ” and adds, 
“ But now the last are first ; the Gentile people confess, the Jews 
in their blindness deny, that their last error may be worse than 
their first.” And Theophylact, “The order of things is reversed, 
while the Jews kill, the disciples fly, and a Gentile confesses. 
Now do the Lord's words (John xii. 32) receive their fulfilment, 
for lifted up on the Cross He drew to Himself the robber and the 
Centurion.” Bede too, “The faith of the Church is very fitly 
designated by the Centurion, for when the Synagogue is mute, it 
affirms Him to be the Son of God.” Lastly, S. Bernard (Serm. 
ii. de Epiph.), “ How keen-sighted is faith 1 It recognises the Son 
of God when at the breast, when hanging on the Cross. If the 
thief recognised Him on the Cross, so did the Magi in the stable. 
The thief proclaims Him King, but the Centurion the Son of God, 
and man too at the same time.” 

Not only the Centurion and the soldiers, but, as S. Luke 
(xxiii. 48) adds, “All the people . . . smote their breasts,” in 
token of sorrow, “and returned.” They begin now to put forth 
the blossoms of repentance, that they may bear fruit at the 
preaching of S. Peter and the Apostles (Acts ii.). 

Here comes in & John xix. 31, on which see notes in loe, 

Ver. 55. And many women were there (< beholding ) afar off, &c. 
S. Matthew says this to set forth how much greater faith, con- 
stancy, and affection for Jesus these women had than men. “See 
how things were reversed,” says Euthymius; “the disciples had 
fled, but the women remained.” For women are commonly more

holy than men, and hence the Church prays “ for the devout sex 
of women. 1 ’ It was also to point out that they, as grave and 
pious matrons, were reliable witnesses of what had taken place, 
and moreover that they had carefully provided for His buriaL 
It was also to show that they had been so drawn to Him by His 
patience and holiness, that they could not be torn away, either by 
fear, or by the threats of the Jews, from wondering, gazing, and 
meditating on Him. 

Many women. The Blessed Mother was the chief, the others 
merely her attendants. She “ stood by the Cross,” bearing all the 
pains in her compassion which He endured in His Passion, and 
with like constancy and fortitude. S. Antoninus says ( TheoL 
par. iv. tit. 15, cap. 41), “The Virgin was so conformed to the 
Divine Will, that, if necessary (as Anselm says), she would herself 
have offered Him on the Cross; for her obedience was equal to 
Abraham’s.” 

Damascene (de Fide , iv. 25) points out the greatness of her pain. 
“The Virgin suffered at the Passion the pangs she escaped in 
child-birth.” And S. Anselm (dc Excell. Virg. cap. v.), “Whatever 
suffering was inflicted on martyrs was light, O Virgin, compared 
with thine.” And S. Laur. Justiniani (de Agone Christy cap. 
ii.), “The heart of the Virgin was made the br : 3htest mirror of 
Christ’s Passion ; ” and cap. xvii., “ The Son was crucified in body, 
the Mother in mind.” And S. Bernard, in Apoc. xii., on the 
words “a great sign,” says, “A mighty pain, O Virgin, pierced 
thy soul, so that we rightly term thee more than martyr, for in 
thee the feeling of compassion was far greater than the sense of 
bodily suffering.” 

Baronius (ad An. 34, cap. xi.) describes, from Simeon Meta- 
phrastes, her great self-possession, in helping to take Him down 
from the Cross, treasuring the nails in her bosom, washing His 
wounds with her tears, embracing His body in her arms, and 
saying at last with calm voice, “ O Lord, the mystery ordained for 
Thee before all ages has come at length.” And on giving the 
napkin to Joseph, she said, “It will now be thy duty to bury Him

honourably in this, to perfume Him with myrrh, and to perform 
for Him all rightful observances.” 

Afar off. S. John says they stood “ by the Cross,” meaning 
thereby opposite to it, though at some distance. For the soldiers 
who were watching Christ, and the dense crowd, kept them from 
coming very near. But they came as close as they could to hear 
and see Him. Adrichomius says about eighteen paces. Some 
say that they were close at one time, and farther off at another. 
The Greek adds, “ beholding” both the wondrous patience of 
Jesus, and the prodigies which took place around Him, and 
pondering over them in their mind with holy meditation. 

Ministering unto Him . Supporting Him and His disciples. 
S. Jerome says, “It was a Jewish custom for women thus to 
minister to their teachers.” 

Among whom (as the chief and leader of the rest) was Mary 
Magdalene , from whom He had cast forth seven devils, who clung 
to Him from gratitude, and would not be tom from Him. 

And Mary the mother of James and Joses \ The wife of Cleophas 
or Alphseus. Salmeron considers her the daughter of Cleophas; 
called from her relationship, Mary the sister of our Lord’s mother, 
from her husband, Mary (the wife) of Alphaeus. See above, chap, 
xiii. 55. 

And the mother of Zebededs children . Salome. See Mark xv. 40. 

Ver. 57. But when even was come. Evening was drawing on, 
but had not yet come, and it was necessary for Him to be buried 
before the evening, when the Sabbath (on which they had to rest) 
began.

make such a request, says S. Jerome. 

Of Arimathaa. Called (1 Sam. L) Ramathaim-Zophim, after- 
wards Rama, Aarima, and Memphtis (S. Jerome, de locis Hcbr.\

means “ lifted up,” as was Joseph here.

betrothed husband of the Virgin.* and was buried by another 
Joseph. Joseph means “increased” — that is, by the grace of 
God. For as the Patriarch Joseph abounded in chastity and 
affection for his father, so did Joseph the husband of the Virgin 
excel in chastity ; and this Joseph, again, was eminent for his tender 
love for Christ, his spiritual father, when now dead. S. Mark calls 
him a noble Counsellor (floukturrie ), in Vulg. decurio , which was 
the provincial word for Senator. He is supposed to have been a 
Councillor of Jerusalem, from his having lived and made his 
burial-place there. Maldonatus supposes he took part in the 
Council about taking and killing Christ (Matt. xxvi. 4), but that 
he did not agree with the rest (Luke xxiiL 51). “Whence some 
think,” says S. Jerome, “that he is spoken of in Ps. i.” 

Who also himself was Jesus' disciple \ and thus wished to perform 
the last offices for his Master. 

Ver. 58. He came to Pilate. “Came boldly,” says S. Mark, 
for though, for fear of the Jews, he was a secret disciple, yet he 
fearlessly entered on this difficult work ; for he was both 
strengthened by Christ and urged on by the Blessed Virgin (see 
above, ver. 55). “From this we may see,” says Victor of Antioch, 
“his great resolution and boldness, for he nearly sacrificed his 
own life for Christ’s sake, by drawing down on himself the 
suspicions of his Jewish enemies;” and S. Chrysostom, “The 
boldness of Joseph is highly to be admired, when for love of 
Christ he incurred peril of death, and exposed himself to general 
hatred.” S. Luke and S. Mark say, “who also himself waited 
for the Kingdom of God.” He hoped, i.e. } through Christ, for 
heavenly love, and thus risked danger for His sake. 

And begged the body of Jesus. S. Anselm (Dial, de Pass.) says it 
was revealed to himself by the Blessed Virgin that Joseph gave 
this reason, among others, for his request, that His mother was 
dying of grief for her only Son, and that it was unreasonable that

THE BURIAL.

the innocent mother should die as well as the Son ; but that it 
would be some consolation to her to bury Him. Grant her, 
therefore, most afflicted as she is, this favour. It is probable, 
also, that he alleged the holiness and innocence of Jesus, which 
Pilate well knew, and that therefore His body ought not to be cast 
forth with those of criminals into the Valley of Corpses, adjoining 
Golgotha, but was worthy of honourable burial, which he was ready 
to provide. 

A wild story is here told, on the authority of the Gospel of 
Nicodemus, that Joseph was in consequence imprisoned by the 
Chief Priests, and miraculously delivered; and that, when the 
Chief Priests required the soldiers to produce the body of Jesus, 
they replied, “Do you produce Joseph, and we will produce 
Christ ” (Greg. Tur. Hist i. 21), whereupon the soldiers were 
acquitted of the charge. There is an equally improbable story in 
Baronius (ad An. 35, cap. 4), that Joseph crossed with S. Mary 
Magdalene and others in a vessel without oars or sail to Marseilles, 
and from thence to England, where he preached Christ, and was 
venerated after his death there as the Apostle of England. 

Then (having heard and approved of Joseph’s reasons) Pilate 
commanded the body to be delivered. That he might thus make Him 
some kind of satisfaction for having condemned Him to death, 
and also palliate his own conduct by giving Him an honourable 
burial, as though he had condemned Him by compulsion. 

To be delivered. On Joseph paying a price, says Theophylact 
But this is not probable, for the reasons just given, and because 
S. Mark says, “ He gave the body to Joseph,” who had it as a 
gift, and did not pay for it It would indeed have been a most 
sordid and avaricious act for Pilate to have sold it “To be 
delivered” means “to be given,” as in the Syriac. But the 
Evangelist says “to be delivered,” because the body had been 
already given up to the soldiers for crucifixion. He orders them, 
therefore, to return it to Joseph. S. Mark adds, “But Pilate 
marvelled if He were already dead,” because the thieves were not 
yet dead, and also (says Euthymius) because he expected that

Jesus would die slowly, being a divine man, far surpassing others 
in endurance. “ But when he knew from the Centurion that He 
was dead, he gave the body to Joseph” (Mark xv. 45). 

Ver. 59. And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in 
a dean linen doth. Such a cloth well suited this most pure body. 
Sindon is a cloth woven of the finest and most delicate flax, so 
called from Sidon, where it was first made. The Jews used to 
wrap their dead bodies in it, bound their hands and feet with 
bandages, and the head with a napkin (John xi. 44). Thus did 
Joseph do to Christ (John xix. 40). S. Jerome from this condemns 
the lavish funerals of the rich, and adds, 44 But we can take this to 
signify, in a spiritual sense, that he who receives Jesus in a pure 
mind wraps him in a clean linen cloth.” 

For this reason the body of Christ is in the Mass placed only in 
a very clean and fine linen cloth. This is called a Corporal, from 
the body of Christ which it contains within it, as though in a tomb. 
S. John adds that Nicoderaus brought myrrh and aloes to anoint 
and perfume the body (John xix. 39). For these kept bodies from 
putrefying. 

Mystically: Euthymius wishes us to be fragrant with these oint- 
ments when we receive the body of Christ in our breast, as in a 
new tomb. 44 Let us, too,” he says, 44 when we receive the body of 
Christ at the altar, anoint it with sweet odours, i.e, 9 by virtuous 
acts and by contemplation,” &c. Baronius describes from Jewish 
writers their mode of laying out for burial. 

Ver. 60. And laid it in his own new tomb y which he had hewn 
out in the rock . S. John adds (xix. 41) that it was in a garden. 
It was 44 a new tomb,” lest any one else who had there been 
buried should be supposed (says S. Chrysostom) or pretended 
(S. Jerome) to have risen again. S. Augustine says. 

Mystically: As no one either before or after Him was conceived 
in the Virgin’s womb, so no one either before or after Him was 
buried in this tomb. 

In the rock . 44 For had it been built of many stones, and the 

foundations had fallen in, it might have been said that the body

DESCRIPTION OF THE TOMB.

had been stolen away,” says S. Jerome. Bede, on Mark xv., de- 
scribes fully its shape, “ That it was so high that a man could hardly 
touch the top. Its entrance was on the east On the north was 
the place where the Lord lay, raised up above the rest of the floor, 
and open on the south.” Adrichomius also describes it, and adds 
“ that Joseph gave up his own tomb to Christ, who was thus buried 
in the grave of a stranger.” “ He who had no home of His own 
when alive (says Theophylact), has no tomb of His own, but is 
laid in another’s tomb, and being naked is clothed by Joseph.” 
“He is buried,” says S. Augustine {Serm. cxxxiii. de Temp.), “in the 
tomb of another, because He died for the salvation of others. 
Why needed He a tomb of His own, who had not any true cause 
of death in Himself? Why needed He a tomb on earth, whose 
seat was for ever in Heaven ? What had He to do with a tomb, 
who for the space of three days rather rested in His bed than lay 
dead in the grave ? ” 

Anagogicaily : Christ thus signified that He and His were 
strangers on earth, and that Heaven was their true country. S. 
Antony, S. Ephrem, S. Francis, and others preferred to be buried 
in another’s grave, and not their own, after Christ’s pattern. Here, 
then, was fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy (xi. 10), “ And His sepulchre 
shall be glorious.” Hence, too, the custom of pilgrimages to 
Jerusalem for so many centuries. Hence the erection by S. Helena 
of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with its surpassing splendour, 
enclosing under the same roof the site of the crucifixion, resur- 
rection, &c. Hence the wish of Godfrey of Bouillon, and other 
kings after him, to be buried on the same spot, and the institution 
also of an order of knighthood. 

Lastly, that tomb was in a garden, because Adam had sinned in 
a garden. Hence, too, Christ began His Passion in a garden, and 
completed it by being buried in a garden. And this, too, to atone 
for the sentence passed on Adam ; and, moreover, that He might 
form and plant a most beautiful garden, flourishing with the blossoms 
and fruits of all virtues, His Church. Note here that Christ’s 

body was laid in the tomb, as on the Cross, with its head and face

so turned as to look away from the east, and towards the west 
So Bede and Adrichoraius. 

Observe, Christ, as soon as He expired, descended in His soul to 
the Limbus Patrum , and made the patriarchs glad by manifesting 
to them Himself and His Godhead. He freed also the souls in 
Purgatory, and gave them the first general jubilee. He manifested 
His Godhead to them also, and made them blessed (see on i Pet 
iii. 19). The devils also, and ungodly men in hell, He condemned 
to perpetual punishment, as their Lord, their Judge, and their 
triumphant Victor. The soul of Christ there remained till the 
third day, when it came forth with the Patriarchs and other saints, 
resumed its body, and rose in glory. He then made the Patriarchs 
resume their bodies, and rise together with Him. The order, 
mode, and time when these things took place is mentioned in the 
beginning of Chap, xxviil Observe, the Godhead of Christ, the 
Divine Person of the Word, ever remained hypostatically united 
both to His body in the tomb and to His soul in the Limbus , for 
that which it once assumed it never gave up, and will not give up 
for ever. 

And he rolled (aided by his servants and Nicodemus) a great 
stone to the door of the sepulchre. That no one might take away 
the body ; or, rather, Divine Wisdom so ordered it, lest the Jews 
after the resurrection should deny the fact, and maintain that the 
Apostles, who had stolen the body away, had boldly invented the 
tale. And for the same reason God willed that His body should 
be buried by those, as Joseph and Nicodemus, who were worthy of 
credit, and that it should be sealed up and watched by the Jews, 
that in this way His death and subsequent resurrection might be 
clearly known to all. Now the Lord's body, while still in the 
grave, gave indeed an indication and prelude (as it were) of His 
resurrection, by remaining uncorrupt for three days; being in 
truth a virgin and holy body, fashioned by the Holy Spirit, and 
as such does it abide for ever.

Salome, having no further office to do for Jesus, returned home in 
sorrow, or took home the Blessed Virgin. Simeon Metaphrastes, 
however, asserts that the Blessed Virgin remained on the spot till 
the resurrection, as assuredly believing that it would take place on 
the third day. 

Sitting over against the sepulchre. Our Lord, as was fitting, was 
laid out by men, and not by women, who, while this was taking 
place, did not venture to enter the sepulchre. But they waited 
till the men retired, and then went in and saw how he was laid, 
that they might return very early the next morning, when the 
Sabbath was over, and anoint His body. 

Ver. 62. Now the next day , that followed the day of the prepara- 
tion , the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate. The 
day of the preparation was the Friday, so called because they 
then prepared everything needed for the Sabbath, on which day 
they had to rest. 

But it was the day after, that is, on the Sabbath, that they came 
together unto Pilate. Theophylact says, “He names not the 
Sabbath, for there was no Sabbath (or rest) in the Jews’ madness.” 
They raged, indeed, like madmen against Jesus, to abolish utterly 
His name and memory. And it increased their rage to see Him 
so honourably buried, as though it were the prelude to His future 
resurrection, whether it were actually to occur, or would be a 
mere invention of the disciples. 

Ver. 63. Saying, , Sir, we remember that deceiver said \ when He 
was yet alive. “That impostor” (S. Augustine, Horn, xxxvi. inter 
L). “By this name,” he says also (in Ps. lxiii. 7), “was the 
Lord Jesus Christ called, to console His servants when called 
deceivers.” 

After three days I will rise again. Three days not completed, 
but only begun, i.e., within three days, or the third day after. 

Ver. 64. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until 
the third day , lest His disciples come and steal Him away , and say 
unto the people. He is risen from the dead. Wishing before this 
to prove Him an impostor, they carry out their malice even to the

grave. They were greatly afraid that He would rise again, and 
therefore ask for a guard, either to keep Him from rising, or to 
seize Him at the moment and put Him to death. For what they 
add about the disciples stealing Him was a mere pretext, for they 
knew that they had fled in fear and consternation, and would 
never think or attempt anything of the kind. 

So the last error shall be worse than the first The first error 
was the Gospel doctrine that Jesus was the Son of God. The 
last error was His resurrection, and it would be the worst as 
confirming the first. For if Jesus had spoken falsely in calling 
Himself the Son of God, God would not “have raised Him.” 
But if He is believed to have risen, He will have a multitude of 
followers ; and if this belief once takes root, it will not afterwards 
be eradicated. Lastly, it would arouse great hatred and ill-will 
against the Chief Priests and Romans for having killed Him 
unjustly; and might indeed lead them to avenge His death by 
war or rebellion. It would therefore have been better not to 
have killed Him than to allow Him to rise again. For the devil, 
foreseeing the future of the Church (the numbers, the faith, the 
holiness of Christ's followers), endeavoured to crush and choke it 
in its birth. But “there is no counsel against the Lord” (Prov. 
xxi. 30). 

Ver. 65. Pilate said unto them , Ye have a watch (/.*., the soldiers 
assigned you for His crucifixion ; use them now to guard Him in 
the grave). 

Go your way , make it as sure as ye can . Guard Him as ye 
know how (Vulg.), in the best way ye know. I leave to your 
skill and prudence the mode of doing it I do not wish to inter- 
fere any more in this matter. “As if taught by experience,* 
says S. Chrysostom, “he does not wish to act with them any 
further.” 

Some take the word ( f^«r 1) imperatively, Take ye, summon ye 
the guard. But it is more forcible to consider it in the indicative 
mood, “Ye have,” &c. (So Vulg., Arab., and A. V.) 

Ver. 66. So they went their way , and made the sepulchre sure,

sealing the stone , and setting a watch . They secured the sepulchre 
in a twofold way — with the guard of soldiers, whom they ordered 
to keep diligent watch, and by sealing the stone. 

They sealed it with a signet, not Pilate’s, as S. Chrysostom 
suggests, but with their own, t\e. 9 with the signet of the city of 
Jerusalem, or of the Sanhedrim, so that the stone could not be 
moved, nor the body be taken away, without its being detected. 
So, too, Darius (Dan. vi. 17). Nicephorus adds that the Jews 
bored through both the stones of the tomb, and fastened them 
with an iron band. And thus, by endeavouring to prevent the 
resurrection of Christ, they did but add to the miracle, and 
furnished greater evidence for it ; which God, as it were, extorted 
from them. So S. Chrysostom, “An undoubted demonstration 
is furnished by your own doings. For if the sepulchre were 
sealed, no room was left for fraud and deceit. But if no fraud 
had been committed, and the tomb was found empty, it is clear 
beyond all question that He had risen. Thou seest how, even 
against their will, they help to demonstrate the truth.” “It was 
not enough,” says S. Jerome, “for the Chief Priests and Pharisees 
to have crucified the Lord, unless they took a band of soldiers, 
sealed the stone, and, as far as they could, opposed His resur- 
rection ; so that all they did was for the furtherance of our faith. 
For the more it is kept back, the more fully is the power of the 
resurrection displayed.” 

Tropologically : Says Barradius, “From this deed of the ungodly 
let us learn godliness. After we have received Christ into our 
breast, as into a new tomb, let us take diligent heed that He 
may remain therein by grace, and never forsake us. Let us post 
our vigilant guards— that is, our watchful virtues — to drive away 
sleep and sloth from us; let us gird ourselves with a weapon 
stronger than iron; let us fortify our breasts with an unconquer- 
able resolve to sin no more.”

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

I Christs resurrection is declared by an angel to the women . 9 He himself 

appear cth unto them . II The high priests give the soldiers money to say that 
he was stolen out of his sepulchre. 16 Christ appeareth to his disciples , 
19 and sendelh them to baptize and teach all nations. 

I N the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the 
week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 

2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord 
descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and 
sat upon it. 

3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow : 

4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men . 

5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye : for I know 
that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 

6 He is not here : for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the 
Lord lay. 

7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and, 
behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have 
told you. 

8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and 
did run to bring his disciples word. 

9 U And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying. 
All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 

10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they 
go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 

11 IT Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the 
city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 

12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, 
they gave large money unto the soldiers, 

13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while 
we slept 

14 And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and

the women at the sepulchre. $27 

15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught : and this saying is 
commonly reported among the Jews until this day. 

16 IF Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain 
where Jesus had appointed them. 

17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him : but some doubted. 

18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto 
me in heaven and in earth. 

19 IT Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost : 

20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : 
and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. 

In the evening of the Sabbath (Vulg.), as the first day of the 
week was dawning, See. How could it be called evening if day was 
dawning, or even if, as S. Mark says, the sun were risen? Firstly, 
S. Jerome answers that these women had gone forth frequently to 
the sepulchre, both in the evening and in the morning, so that 
the Evangelists refer to different occasions of their going forth. 

Secondly, S. Ambrose thinks that they were different women 
who went out in the evening and in the morning. So Nyssen 
( Or at. 2, on the Resurrection) thinks that the women went four 
times to the sepulchre. But it is clear to any one who compares 
the different accounts, that the Evangelists speak of the same visit 
made by the same women to the sepulchre of Christ. 

Thirdly, Baronius by the eitening understands the star of Venus, 
which is called Lucifer, so that the meaning will be, “When 
Lucifer was risen in the morning before the sun, Mary Magdalene 
came to the sepulchre of Christ ,, But this star is not denoted 
by the Greek word 34*, or by the Latin word Vespere. 

I say, therefore, that by the evening of the Sabbath is signified 
the night which followed the Sabbath. That it was so clear, 
first, from S. Mark, who says, and when the Sabbath was passed; 
secondly, because S. Matthew is wont to sum up many things in 
a few words. Accordingly, he here sums up the time when the 
women came together and made preparations for visiting and 
anointing Christ, which was in the evening, or immediately the 
Sabbath was passed; and he also wished to indicate the time 
when they came to the sepulchre, which was at the dawn of the

8. MATTHEW, C. XXVIII. 


Lord’s day. For this is what S. Luke says (chap, xxiii. 56), 
44 And they returned (after Christ had been buried), and prepared 
spices and ointments , and rested on the Sabbath day t according to the 
commandment ; and on the first day of the week, very early in the 
morning , they came to the sepulchre^ bringing the spices which they 
had prepared ” And S. Mark (xvi. 1) says, 41 When the Sabbath 
was passed^ Mary Magdalene , , and Mary the mother of James> and 
Salome , bought spices , that they might come and anoint Jesus . 
And very early in the morning on the first day of the week) they 
came to the sepulchre Mark is generally the interpreter of 
Matthew. S. Augustine says, 41 Thus, on the evening of the Sab- 
bath is just the same as if he had said on the night of the 
Sabbath , that is, the night which follows the day of the Sabbath, 
which is sufficiently proved by the words which follow, as it 
began to dawn towards the first day of the week. 1 * This could 
not be if we understood only the first portion of the night, its 
beginning, to be signified by the word evening. For the evening, 
or beginning of the night, does not begin to dawn towards the 
first day of the week, but only the night which is concluded by 
the dawn. For the end of the first part of the night is the 
beginning of the second ; and the dawn is the end of the whole 
night. Whence the evening could not be said to dawn towards 
the first day of the week, unless by the word evening the night 
itself is understood, which is concluded by the dawn. 

Matthew, therefore, declares that these women had prepared 
ointments at night, but came to the sepulchre at the rising of the 
dawn, as Luke, John, and Mark say. But John adds that they 
came early in the morning, while it was yet dark. I answer, That 
also is true, because it was dawn, since the sun not having yet 
appeared, but only his rays reflected from the hills or clouds, 
there still remained a measure of darkness in the air. 

Peter Chrysologus, in a sermon on the resurrection, gives 
another symbolical reason. “According to nature,” he says, 
44 it was dark, and yet it is said that the sun had risen, because 
on that day the sun, rejoicing as it were at the resurrection of

Christ, rose before the wonted time.” Remigius agrees with 
Chrysologus, “ The dignity of that night is declared, for according 
to the course of nature evening does not dawn towards day, 
but darkness towards night; but the Lord by the light of His 
resurrection made the whole of that night joyful and brilliant.” 

It is clear that these women came to the sepulchre early in 
the morning; for their love for Christ urged them on to hasten 
to this, and anticipate the day; and also their fear of the Jews, 
lest if they had come by daylight, and had been seen by the Jews, 
who were hostile to Him, they should have been ill-treated by 
them. 

Further, Matthew here only mentions directly the time of the 
coming of the women to the sepulchre, yet he indirectly signifies 
also the time at which Christ rose, namely, in the early morn- 
ing, a little before the arrival of the women, according to the 
common opinion of the Doctors and the Church, which S. 
Jerome and S. Augustine prove from Ps. lvi. 9, / will awake 
early. 

The general sense, then, is, that Christ rose after the middle 
of the night before sunrise on the Lord’s day, for otherwise He 
would have been found dead by the women ; and as He was born 
at the same time thirty-three years before of the Blessed Virgin, 
so now He was born again through the resurrection, that He 
might as a new Sun of Righteousness shine upon the world. 
Whence also in former times, Christians, after the middle of the 
night on the day of the Passover, broke off their fast and keeping 
of vigil, and began to rejoice greatly. 

Further, Christ does not seem to have risen immediately after 
the middle of the night For Mark more exactly says that Christ 
rose early in the morning. And most of the Fathers teach this, 
whom Suarez quotes (3. p. disp. 46, sect, a), and the Church in the 
Paschal hymn, Aurora lucis. 

On the first day of the week. That is, on the first day after the 
Sabbath, on the Lord’s day; about the religious observance of 
which day S. Augustine thus writes (Sertn. 2$i, de Temp.), “The

S. MATTHEW, c. XXVJIt. 


Apostles and apostolic men appointed that day to be observed 
with holy solemnity, because on it our Redeemer rose from the 
dead ; and it is called on that account the Lord’s day, that 
abstaining on it from earthly works, we may devote ourselves only 
to the study of divine things, giving to this day honour and 
reverence, on account of the hope of our resurrection, which we 
have in it For, as the Lord rose from the dead, so also we 
hope that we shall rise.” 

Mary Magdalene and the other Mary . That is, the wife of 
Cleophas and mother of James. These were the leaders and 
standard-bearers of the rest who were wont to follow Christ; for 
that there were several others is clear from Luke xxiii. 55, where, 
among others, he names Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s 
steward ; and Mark adds Salome. The Blessed Virgin Mother of 
God did not come with them, because she certainly knew and 
expected that Christ would rise on that same day; whence she 
knew that the anointing would be useless. 

Morally: Learn from this that Christ reveals Himself and His 
grace and glory to those souls who hasten to anoint Him with 
the good works of prayer, penance, and charity. Whence S. 
Gregory (Mom. 21) says, “Those women who came with spices 
see the angels; and so those souls behold the heavenly citizens 
who, with the sweet odours of their virtues, approach the Lord in 
holy desires.” 

To see the sepulchre. It is very probable that they were ignorant 
of the watch of the soldiers that had been posted by the Jews 
at the sepulchre, and also of the sealing. For if they had known 
of these two things, they would not have dared to come to the 
sepulchre, lest they should fall into the hands of the watch, much 
less to break the seal. But God removed both of these hindrances 
out of their way. Hence learn courageously to undertake works 
for the glory of God, and certainly to trust that God will either 
remove, or cause us to surmount, all hindrances that lie in our 
way. 

Mystically: Bede (on Luke xxiv.) says, “By the women coming

Coming early to the kJriVs body. 


33i 


early in the morning to the sepulchre, we have an example given 
to us, that, having cast away the darkness of our vices, we should 
come to the body of the Lord. For that sepulchre also bore the 
figure of the altar of the Lord, wherein the mysteries of Christ’s 
body, not in silk or purple cloth, but in pure white linen, like that 
in which Joseph wrapped it, ought to be consecrated, that as He 
offered up to death for us the true substance of His earthly nature, 
so we also, in commemoration of Him, should place on the altar 
the flax, pure from the plant of the earth, and white, and in many 
ways refined by a kind of crushing to death. But the spices 
which the women bring signify the odour of virtue and the sweet- 
ness of prayers, by which we ought to approach the latter.” 

The following was the order of events: — First, Christ was in 
His Passion during about eighteen hours. For on the Thursday, 
towards evening, He ate the lamb, He washed the disciples’ feet, 
He instituted the Eucharist, and held a long discourse on love, 
and at last proceeded to Gethsemane; all which things would 
easily take up three hours. Wherefore, about the third hour of 
his death in Gethsemane, He began to be sorrowful, and to pray 
that the cup might pass from Him. Hence, if you reckon all the 
hours up to the third hour in the afternoon of Friday, when Christ 
died, you will find eighteen hours; so that you may learn, accord- 
ing to the moral meaning, how short is the time of the suffering 
of Christ and of Christians, and how long the time of resurrection 
and of glory, for it is eternal. So bountiful is God, so brief is the 
suffering, so long the reward and the glory. 

Secondly, Christ dying at the third hour in the afternoon, im- 
mediately as to His soul went down into hell ; but His body was 
taken down from the Cross, and washed and wrapped in linen, 
so that He was buried before night, for it was the night of 
the Sabbath, on which the Jews must rest from all work. Where- 
fore He was in hell about thirty-six hours (but in the sepulchre 
thirty-three). 

Thirdly, Christ, as soon as He appeared in hell, that is, in 
Limbus, showed to Adam and Abraham and the rest of the

fathers and prophets, not only His soul, but also His Deity 
united to it Wherefore He gladdened them with the vision 
of His divinity ; then, too, did hell become like heaven. Whence 
He said to the robber who was about to go to Him in Limbus , , 
To-day thou shalt be with Me in paradise. 

Fourthly, About the ninth hour of the night of the Lord’s day, 
Christ, having passed forth from hell with the fathers, came to 
the sepulchre, and there He showed them His body, livid, blood- 
stained, and torn for them; and presently cleansing His body 
from all lividness, blood, and ointment, and again sending angels 
(though some are of opinion that all these things were done 
not by angels, but by the soul of Christ itself, which had this 
power through the hypostatic union with the Word) to gather up 
the blood which had been scattered by the scourging; and after 
it had been gathered up, He again infused it into the veins of His 
body, which the glorious soul of Christ entered, and uniting to 
itself, animated and glorified. 

Fifthly, To many of the fathers, as Abraham and others, He 
restored their bodies, that He might make them sharers of His 
resurrection and glory, and witnesses of it to the Jews, as is clear 
from Matt xxvii. 53. 

Sixthly, Christ, when He rose, passed through the stone that 
covered the sepulchre. Soon afterwards the angel descended and 
caused an earthquake, and removed the stone from the sepulchre 
that He might arouse the watch, and open a way for the women to 
the sepulchre. 

Seventhly, He appeared in glory to the Blessed Virgin, His 
mother, and showed the Patriarchs to her, who all saluted her, 
and were filled with great joy. Then He appeared to Mary 
Magdalene, who had stayed near the sepulchre. 

Tropologically : Learn here how religiously we ought to venerate 
and adorn the tombs and relics of Christ, the Martyrs, and other 
Saints. “The bodies of the just,” says S. Augustine, “are not to 
be thought meanly o£ which the Holy Spirit used as organs and 
vessels for all good works.”

THE EARTHQUAKE. 


333 


And, behold, there was a great earthquake , &c. Firstly, By it 
was signified the power, magnificence, and glory of Christ in His 
resurrection as God. For by an earthquake God made known 
His presence on Sinai and elsewhere. 

Secondly, That the women might recognise the angel not only 
from his glorious appearance, but from this earthquake, and might 
more easily believe the resurrection of Christ proclaimed by the 
angel; especially because by means of the earthquake he rolled 
away the stone from the door of the sepulchre, that the women 
might enter, and seeing it empty, might know that Christ was 
risen. 

Symbolically : The earth which trembled with horror at the death 
of Christ, as it were leaped with joy at the resurrection. 

For the angel ' &c. Franciscus Lucas and others are of opinion 
that this angel was Gabriel, who, according to the meaning of 
his name, is the minister of the power of God. It is not to be 
doubted that other angels were present with him, and guarded 
the sepulchre during the three days, and adored the sacred body 
of Christ lying in it, as being hypostatically united to the Deity. 

Further, the angel appeared in the form of a young man, as 
Mark says, first, because youth is a sign of the never-failing vigour 
and strength of the angels. Secondly, because the angel repre- 
sented Christ, who was a young man ; for He died and rose again 
in the thirty-fourth year of His age. Thirdly, his youth showed 
that he was strong and warlike, ready to fight against the watch. 
Lastly, youth represents beauty, immortality, activity, and the glory 
of the glorious body which Christ had assumed in the resurrection. 

And rolled away the stone , of the sepulchre of Christ. Not that 
He might rise out of it, for He had already risen while the 
sepulchre was closed, but that he might show to the women that 
Christ their God and Lord had already risen. Opening to them a 
way to the sepulchre, he showed it to them empty of the body 
of Christ For as Christ was born from the closed womb of the 
Viigin, so also He rose from the closed sepulchre. 

S. Augustine ( Serm , 138, de Temp.) says, 44 The unbelieving Jews

set a seal on the stone of the sepulchre that Christ might not 
come forth. But how would it be impossible for Him to come 
forth from the sepulchre who had come forth from the pure womb 
of His mother, her virginity being preserved? He escaped the 
notice of the guards; He leaped forth from the sepulchre; He 
appeared to the disciples when the doors were shut: from the 
one place He came forth when He was shut in; into the other 
He entered when He was shut out” So Euthymius, Chrysostom, 
&c. S. Leo, in his 83rd epistle to the monks of Palestine, says 
that the stone being rolled back, Christ rose again on the third 
day; and that the rolling back of the stone was not the cause, 
but the sign and the proof that the resurrection of Christ was not 
in appearance only, but real. 

We may gather, hence, in opposition to Calvin, that by the same 
power of God, whole Christ can be obtained under a small host 
For if Christ in passing through the stone of the sepulchre could 
occupy the same place as the stone, therefore in the same host 
there can be at the same time the great and several members of 
Christ The Calvinists, in order to evade this argument, answer 
that the stone being softened like wax melted away, and so opened 
a way for Christ as He rose. But this is an absurd figment of 
theirs, and altogether opposed to the consent of the Fathers, the 
Doctors, and the Church. 

Some think that there were two stones to the sepulchre, the 
first on the outside, which closed the outer entrance of the 
sepulchre ; the second on the inside, which protected the sepulchre 
itself. But the Evangelists make mention of only one stone. 
Chrysologus (Serm. 74) says truly, “The rolling to of the stone 
was a proof of death; the rolling back of it asserted the resur- 
rection.” And Severian in the Catena says, “He says not ‘rolled,* 
but ‘ rolled back 9 the stone ; because the stone rolled to was a 
proof of death, and the rolling of it back asserted the resurrection. 
The order of things is changed. The tomb devours death, and 
not the dead. The house of death becomes the mansion of life ; 
it receives a dead, and renders up a living man.”

SAMSON A TYPE OF THE RESURRECTION. 335 


Samson was a type of this, who having entered Gaza^ and being 
besieged by the Philistines, rose up in the middle of the night and 
carried away the gates to the top of a mountain ; because, as 
S. Gregory (Horn. 21) explains, “our Redeemer rising before it 
was light, not only came forth free from hell, but destroyed also 
the bars of hell. He carried away its gates, and ascended to the 
top of the mountain ; for by rising again He carried away the bars 
of hell, and by ascending He entered the Kingdom of Heavea” 

And sat upon it. Not as if wearied with the labour of removing 
the stone, but to show, first, that it was he who had rolled away 
the stone. Secondly, to protect the women against the watch. 
Thirdly, that he was the guardian of the sepulchre of the Lord, 
says S. Jerome, so that no one seeing it empty might bring in 
another dead body, and say that Christ had not risea Fourthly, 
that he might terrify the soldiers. 

S. Thomas assigns symbolical reasons for the sitting of the angel 
“He sat, though he was not weary, as teacher of the faith, as 
master of the resurrection. The angel laid upon the stone the 
foundations of the faith upon which Christ was going to found His 
Church. Or by the stone may be designated death, by which all 
men were oppressed: by the angel sitting upon the stone it is 
therefore signified that Christ subdued death by His own power.” 
And Bede also says, “ The angel sat, to show that now He had 
overcome him who had the power of death; He had mounted 
the throne of the everlasting kingdom. He sat upon the stone 
that had been rolled back, wherewith the mouth of the sepulchre 
had been closed, to teach that by His power He had burst the 
bars of hell” 

You will say, How do Matthew and Mark say that the angel sat, 
when Luke says that he stood f I answer, that by a Hebraism, to 
stand is a term applicable to any position ; for it only signifies that 
a thing is present, whether standing upright, or sitting, or lying. 
Then, also, the account given by Matthew and Mark is a different 
one from that given by Luke, as I shall presently show. 

You will say, secondly, How does Matthew say that the angel sat

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVin. 


upon the stone rolled back, that is, outside the sepulchre, when 
Mark says that the women saw the angel not outside, but on 
entering into the tomb? I answer, that the angel first removed 
the stone which closed the sepulchre, and then terrified the watch 
who were outside, and drove them away, so that they might not 
hinder the women from approaching the sepulchre ; then, that he 
entered the sepulchre itself, and was there seen by the women, that 
he might show them the empty sepulchre, and that Christ had 
risen. Whence he says, “ He is risen, as He said ; come, see the 
place where the Lord lay.” So Theophylact Or, rather, the angel 
of whom Matthew speaks was a different one from that of whom 
Mark speaks. So Barradius. 

But I maintain that the same angel is spoken of by Mark as 
by Matthew. For Mark is generally the interpreter of Matthew. 
Wherefore, what Mark says about their entering into the tomb is 
to be understand thus, when they were preparing or beginning to 
enter the tomb; for they had not yet entered it, but were still 
outside, and there they saw and heard the angel, as Matthew has 
it For to enter signifies, here and elsewhere, an act begun and 
not finished. 

And his countenance was like lightning, &c. First, because 
lightning is akin to, and best represents the nature and properties 
of angels. For lightning is most brilliant, swift, and powerful. For 
this reason it is spoken of the cherubim who accompany the 
chariot of God (Ezek. L 14), “They ran and returned as the 
appearance of a flash of lightning.’ 1 And the 103d Psalm, quoted 
by Paul, Heb. L, “ Who maketh His angels spirits, and His mini- 
sters a flame of fire.” 

Secondly, lightning signifies the glory of the angels, which shines 
with the lightning of divine knowledge. Again, lightning signi- 
fies the glory of Christ rising ; for the body of Christ shone with 
glory like lightning. For angels, when they appear, appear in that 
manner which is in agreement with the matter on account of which 
they appear. Since, therefore, this angel appears to represent the 
glorious resurrection of Christ, His countenance therefore was like

lightning. For lightning best represents the four properties of the 
glorious body of Christ and of the blessed, namely, brightness, 
impassibility, subtlety, and agility. “For by the resurrection of 
Christ,” says S. Leo, “weakness has been changed into strength, 
mortality into immortality, and shame into glory.” 

Thirdly, Lightning represents the zeal and the anger of the 
angel against the impious Jews and soldiers, who wished to hinder 
the resurrection of Christ Whence to them only he appeared 
shooting forth lightning, as if he were going to spring upon them ; 
but for the women he tempered this lightning, and showed to 
them a countenance glorious indeed, but mild. For the Blessed 
appear to different persons with such appearance and form as 
they will ; wherefore to the women he appeared only clothed with 
a white robe, as Mark says (chap. xvi. 3). Listen to what S. 
Gregory says (Horn. 21, in Evang.\ “In lightning is terror, but 
in snow is a tempered brightness; and because Almighty God 
is terrible to sinners and mild to the righteous, so the angel, 
who is a witness of His resurrection, is rightly shown with a 
countenance like lightning and with raiment like snow, that by his 
appearance he might terrify the wicked and comfort the good.” 
Tropologically : Holy and angelic preachers may be like thunder 
and lightnings, by which the vices of enemies are destroyed. So 
John and James are called by Christ Boanerges — that is, sons 01 
thunder, thundering and lightning against impiety and impious 
men. 

Anagogically : Lightning represents the fire of Gehenna, pre- 
pared for the impious Jews and the soldiers, because lightnings 
are sulphurous, and smell of fire and sulphur, and Gehenna burns 
with fire and sulphur. 

And his raiment was like snow . Pure and white. This bright 
ness signifies, first, the purity, innocence, and chastity of the 
angels ; secondly, the joy and glory of the resurrection of Christ. 

Ver. 4. And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became 
as dead men . That is, they were astonished and stupefied like the 

dead, as S. Jerome says. For they feared lest they should be

blasted, as it were, and killed by lightning. If the angel only by 
the lightning glance of his countenance so struck and terrified 
the soldiers, what would he have done if he had laid his hands on 
them? For one angel slew in one night 185,000 soldiers in the 
camp of Sennacherib. 

Ver. 5. And the angel answered , &c. You will say, How is it 
that Matthew and Mark speak only of one angel as seen by the 
women, when Luke affirms that two were seen, who comforted the 
women with different words from those which Matthew and Mark 
have? I answer that the account of Luke is different from that 
of Matthew, and that he relates what happened later, as I shall 
hereafter show. 

The women . Namely, the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, 
Joanna, and the rest (see Luke xxiv. 10). Those are mistaken, 
therefore, who think that Magdalene, after she had seen the empty 
sepulchre, immediately ran back to tell the Apostles, without 
seeing the angels, and that they were only seen by Mary the 
mother of James and the rest. John, therefore (chap. xx. 1), 
while he mentions Magdalene only, with her understands all the 
rest of her companions ; for she was the leader and chief of them 
all Eve conversing with the devil incurred death; but these 
conversing with the angel found life. Sorceresses and witches are 
like Eve, who, conversing with the devil, drink in death ; but peni- 
tents are like Magdalene, who, invoking angels, obtain life. 

Fear not ye. “The word ye” says S. Chrysostom, “carries 
with it much honour, and at the same time declares that those 
who had dared to commit that great crime would, unless they 
should repent, suffer extreme punishment For it is not, he says, 
for you to fear, but for those who crucified Him.” 

For I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified. The word 
“for” gives the reason why they ought not to fear the sight of 
the angel, but to rejoice and be glad, because they both love and 
worship Jesus which was crucified, and minister to and serve 
Him. 

He expressly says “ crucified, 99 both to show that he is not

ashamed of, but that he openly confesses the Cross and the 
Crucified, and that he is His servant, because the Cross is the 
highest honour and glory to Christ and to His followers, and also 
to signify the fruit of the Cross of Christ; because, says S. 

Chrysostom, it is the head and sum of blessings, and because 

by His Cross Christ redeemed not only the women and the rest 
of mankind, but also made the angels to rejoice, yea, even con- 
ferred grace and glory on them. And lastly, because by the 

Cross He reconciled angels to men, and Heaven to earth, “re- 
conciling through the blood of the Cross both the things which 
are in earth and in Heaven,” as Paul says (Col. i. 20). 

He is not here. “ He is not here in His fleshly presence,” says 
S. Gregory; “and He is nowhere absent in the presence of His 
majesty.” 

For He is risen. The Greek word is viyfylh j, which means, 
He has awaked from death, as it were from a short and light 
sleep, to light and life. For the death of Christ was like sleep, 
for He slept, as it were, in the sepulchre thirty-six hours. So also 
will it be with us. Wherefore, as sleep is a sort of brief death, so 
also death is a sort of longer sleep. Hence Paul (1 Cor. xv.) 
does not speak of those who have departed from life as dead, but 
as sleeping, because we shall all be awakened from the sleep of 
death, and shall arise again to life in the Day of Judgment 

Again, He has awaked as trees, which in winter having been, 
as it were, stripped and asleep, wake up in spring, when they begin 
to put forth leaves and flowers and fruit So S. Jerome (on 
Mark xvi.) says, “The bitter root of the Cross has vanished; for 
the flower of life has burst forth with fruit — that is, He who lay 
in death has arisen in glory.” And in the same glory He will 
make His faithful ones to rise. 

As He said. Christ, whom ye all esteemed as a holy and 
divine Prophet, foretold and promised that He would rise on the 
third day. Therefore believe that He has risen, for so great a 
Prophet could not lie ; especially since ye now see that the body 
has departed from the sepulchre, and has risen, as I, who am an

angel of the living and true God, most certainly affirm. He Himself 
foretold the same by David in the 15th Psalm, “Thou wilt not 
leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to 
see corruption;” because, as S. Peter says (Acts ii. 24), “it was 
impossible that He should be holden of it” 

Moreover, Christ rose before He was anointed by the women, 
that He might show that He did not need that anointing, since 
He rose again by His own power. S. Bernard ( Serm . 12, in Cant.) 
gives another moral reason, — because He would rather the price 
of this anointing should be given to the poor than tp Himself. 

Come. “Enter with nle into the sepulchre; for your sake, 
that you may enter, I have removed the great stone.” See the 
place where the Lord lay. That by the beholding of it with your 
eyes, says S. Chrysostom, ye may see that His body is not here, 
but has risen from it, so that, “ if ye believe not my words, ye may 
believe the empty sepulchre,” says S. Jerome. The angel there- 
fore led the way, and as a guide introduced the women into the 
sepulchre, and showed it to them empty, that they might not doubt 
that Christ had risen from it 

Ver. 7. And go quickly , and tell His disciples , &c Quickly — 
so that ye may quickly banish the sorrow of the disciples, caused 
by the death of Christ their Master, and cheer their sorrowful 
minds, and fill them with joy by the most joyful news of the 
resurrection of Christ For the women deserved this favour 
above others, because above others in their devotion to Christ 
they had come to the sepulchre. S. Gregory {Horn. 25) gives a 
symbolical reason, “For because woman in Paradise ministered 
death to man, woman from the sepulchre announced life to men. 
As if the Lord were saying to mankind, not in words but by 
deeds, 'From that same hand by which the potion of death was 
administered to you, receive ye the cup of life.* ” 

Tell His disciples . Mark adds, and Peter — that is, chiefly and 
before all, Peter, both because Peter in Christ’s absence was the 
first and Prince of the Apostles, and because Peter, as he loved 
Christ above the rest, so also above the rest he was mourning over

* AND PETER.” 

His death. S. Gregory adds a third reason {Horn, 21, in Evang.\ 
M If the angel had not expressly named him who had denied his 
Master, he would not have dared to come amongst the disciples ; 
he is therefore called by name, lest he should despair on account 
of his denial. In which thing we have to consider why Almighty 
God permitted him to fear the words of a maid servant, and to 
deny Himself, whom He had appointed to set over the whole 
Church, which thing we perceive to have been done by a dis- 
pensation of great goodness, in order that he who was to be the 
pastor of the whole Church might learn through his own fault how 
he ought to have compassion upon others.” 

He goeth before you into Galilee . First, because Galilee was the 
native country of the Apostles, to which, after the death of Jesus, 
they were purposing to return, that they might live more safely 
among their own relations. Secondly, because in Galilee Christ 
willed to show Himself openly to all His assembled disciples. 
For the Jews would not have permitted them to assemble in 
Judaea. Thirdly, because in Galilee Christ had for the most part 
preached, and had performed very many miracles. 

Symbolically: S. Gregory ( Horn . 21) says, “For Galilee means 
a passing over from death to life ; for our Redeemer had already 
passed from His Passion to His resurrection, from death unto 
life. And He is seen first by His disciples after His resurrection 
in Galilee, because we shall have joy in seeing the glory of His 
resurrection, if only we pass over from vice to the heights of virtue. 
He, then, who is announced at the tomb is shown in passing over ; 
because He who is first known in mortification of the flesh is seen 
in this passing over of the soul.” Yet Christ appeared to the 
Apostles in Judaea also, but secretly ; in Galilee publicly. 

In the historical order of the events must be brought in here 
what Luke mentions (chap. xxiv. 3), namely, that Magdalene and 
her companions, while at the invitation of the angel they had 
entered the sepulchre and seen that it was empty, yet were 
affrighted ; on account of which the angels cheered them, and at 
the same time gently reproved their want of faith. For that

Luke’s account is not the same as that of Matthew and Mark, as 
some think, is clear from the words themselves, which are evidently 
different. Also, from the circumstance that in Luke two angels 
are said to have appeared, while in Matthew and Mark only one 
is mentioned. 

Ver. 8 . And they went out quickly , &c., with fear. That is, 
with a sacred trembling, which was caused by the sepulchre of 
Christ and the angels, and the resurrection of Christ announced 
by the angels to them, which came upon them in their sorrow for 
the death of Christ, and in their thoughts about anointing Him, 
as a thing not only unexpected but well-nigh incredible ; wherefore 
a new fear was added, lest this vision of angels was only a phantom 
which deceived them, and lest the body of Jesus had been stolen. 

And with great joy . Because they had seen the angels, and 
had received from them the joyful news of His resurrection. 
Their minds, therefore, were alternating between joy and fear. So 
S. Jerome says, “A twofold feeling possessed the minds of the 
women, fear and joy ; fear at the greatness of the miracle, joy in 
their desire for Him that was risen.” 

Tell His disciples . Matthew does not mention what they told ; 
but John and Luke explain it, but in different ways. For John 
says that Magdalene only said to Peter, They have taken away 
my Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have 
laid Him . But Luke says that they related to the Apostles all 
the things they had seen and heard. 

You will say, Whence this difference? I answer, It arises from 
the women being possessed with fear and doubt, and therefore 
they told no one anything by the way. And because they did 
not firmly and certainly believe that Christ had risen, they spoke 
alternating words, in accordance with the alternations of their 
thoughts; for at one time they speak of the vision of angels, at 
another they declare their opinion that the body of the Lord had 
been taken away. 

At this point we must bring into the history what S. John 
relates (chap. xx. 2-19).

Magd&lene, then, was the first to see Christ, as Mark says. After- 
wards, at the command of Christ, she hastened after the other 
women, and overtook them, and then with them again saw Christ, 
and heard His salutation. So SS. Chrysostom, Jerome, and 
others. 

Ver. 9 . And, beholdy Jesus met them, & c. As after the courtiers 
follows the king, as after the priests the High Priest, so here after 
the angels follows Christ, and confirms His resurrection by show- 
ing Himself alive to the pious women. For it was His will that 
the angels should prepare the way for Him, to this end, both that 
they might more easily believe that He had risen, and that they 
might not be terrified, as they would have been if, without warning, 
He had unexpectedly shown Himself to them. 

Met them. Because they were seeking Him with greater affec- 
tion and desire than the men. For he who seeks Jesus with fer- 
vour finds Jesus lovingly coming to meet him, according to that 
saying, A sky and it shall be given you; seek , and ye shall find 1 
So S. Jerome says, “They who thus desired, and who thus ran, 
merited to have their risen Lord come to meet them, and first to 
hear the word * Hail , 1 that the curse of the woman Eve might be 
removed in these women.” 

Tropologically : Rabanus says, “ Jesus sometimes meets those who 
are entering on the path of virtue by helping them.” Moreover, 
Eve is to us the mother of perdition and of sorrow. But these 
women, instead of the word “Eva,” bear the word “Ave,” 
because they are the messengers of resurrection* salvation, and 
joy. Hence we sing to the Blessed Virgin, the mother of Christ, 
the queen of these women, the hymn “ Ave Maris Stella,” & c. 

Hail. In the Greek x a ^ trt — * s > rejoice ; in the Syriac, 
Peace be to you. For this is the proper salutation of the Hebrews, 
in which, under the name of peace, they pray for every blessing 
and every felicity. In the Arabic, Rejoice, because ye see your 
Master now alive again. So, after the example of Christ, blessed 
souls and angels, when they appear to men, cause joy ; but demons, 
and the souls of the damned, cause sorrow, fear, and despair.

S. MATTHEW, c. XXVIII. 


And they came and held Him by the feet That is, with reverence 
and love for His majesty, and with joy at His glorious resurrection, 
they embraced and kissed His feet. So the Shunamite laid hold 
of Elisha’s feet, praying him to raise her dead son to life again. 
So the faithful embrace and kiss the feet of the Pope, and of men 
illustrious for their sanctity. Christ on this occasion allows Him- 
self to be touched by the women, that He may prove to them 
that He is really risen, and make them witnesses and heralds of 
His resurrection. Whence S. Chrysostom says, “ When with great 
joy they had hastened towards, they by touching Him received a 
certain proof of His resurrection.” 

And worshipped Him. With the worship of latria 9 as the true 
Messiah or Christ the Son of God, who by the power of His Deity 
had raised His humanity from death, as He Himself had predicted 
when alive. The vision, therefore, of Christ risen confirmed and 
increased their faith in His Divinity, and in the other mysteries 
which they had been taught by Him when He was alive, but had 
not fully understood ; so that with Thomas they said, if not with 
the mouth, yet certainly with the heart, My Lord and my God \ 

Then said Jesus unto them, Fear not, &c. The vision of what 
is supernatural and celestial, as was the resurrection of Christ, 
strikes and alarms the nature of the beholders ; whence S. Jerome 
says, “ This may be always observed both in the Old and New 
Testament, that when there is an appearance of any majestic 
person, the first thing done is to banish fear, that the mind being 
tranquillised may receive the things that are said.” 

Go, tell My brethren . Christ now made glorious, in order to 
give us an example of humility, calls His disciples brethren, so 
as to console them and raise them up from their sorrow. As if 
He had said, Tell the Apostles, who are the sons of one and the 
same God and Father with Me ; but adopted sons through grace, 
whereas I am His Son by nature through the Deity which I have 
received from Him as God, and through the hypostatic union 
with the Deity which I have received from Him as man. S. 
Chrysostom says, “ Because a woman was made the bfeuse of

sorrow to man, now women are made the ministers of joy to men.” 
Luther wrongly concludes from these words of Christ that women 
may preach; for it is one thing to tell, another to preach. But 
if Christ had said to Magdalene preachy she might and ought to 
have preached. 

There they shall see Me. In Galilee they shall see Me frequently 
and openly, and talk with Me face to face, but not so in Judaea, 
although even there I shall appear to them sometimes. For in 
Judaea on the day of His resurrection Christ appeared six times. 
First, He appeared to His mother, as S. Ambrose, S. Anselm, 
and others teach, and this is the common opinion of the Doctors 
and of the faithful. Secondly, He appeared to the Magdalene 
at the sepulchre ( Mark xvi. 9). Thirdly, He appeared to her 
again with the other women as they returned to Jerusalem (Matt. 
xxviii. 9). Fourthly, He appeared to Peter (Luke xxiv. 34). 
Fifthly, to the two disciples as they went to Emmaus (Luke xxiv.). 
Sixthly, to all — that is, to ten of the Apostles, for Thomas was 
not with them, and Judas had hanged himself. After the day 
of the resurrection He appeared, first, to the eleven Apostles, 
when Thomas was with them, on the eighth day (John xx. 26). 
Secondly, He appeared to eleven disciples, among whom were 
Peter and John, as they were fishing in the Sea of Galilee (John 
xxi.). Thirdly, He appeared on a mountain in Galilee to many — 
that is, to more than five hundred (Matt, xxviii. 10; 1 Cor. xv. 6). 
Fourthly, He appeared to James the brother of the Lord in the 
same place. Fifthly, He appeared to all the Apostles, and to 
others of the faithful, on the Mount of Olives, when He was going 
to ascend into Heaven (Acts i. 9). Sixthly, He appeared to Saul 
when He made him Paul. Christ appeared often on other occa- 
sions, which are not mentioned by the Evangelists. 

Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch , &c. We 
may conclude from this, that when the soldiers saw the angel 
rolling away the stone they fled and hid themselves behind the 
hedges, and there remained half dead with fear, so that they could 
not and dared not stir from the place ; and this was according to

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVIIL 


the purpose of God, that they might, from their hiding-places, see 
and hear all that the angels said to the women about the resurrec- 
tion of Jesus, so that they might report the same things to the 
Chief Priests, and so become messengers of the resurrection of 
Christ. Wherefore neither the women, nor Peter and John, saw 
the soldiers, who were lying hid in the hedges. But after the 
vision of angels had disappeared, and when the women had 
departed from the sepulchre, the soldiers, coming to themselves, 
approached the sepulchre, and seeing it empty, they formed a plan, 
and sent some of their number to the Chief Priests to tell them 
all they had seen and heard, and to show that it was not through 
their carelessness that the body of Christ had left the sepulchre. 

And when they were assembled with the elder s, &c. See here the 
perversity of the priests and elders, who, not content with having 
put Christ to death, persecute Him after His death, and try to do 
away with His resurrection, so as to cover their crime, and lest 
any one should rise against them as the slayers of Christ, and 
avenge His death. This was the design of the devil, who was 
attempting to destroy the Church and all Christians in Christ 
The priests corrupt the soldiers with money, who were witnesses 
of the truth, that they might become witnesses of a lie. S. Jerome 
says that they took this money from the treasury of the Temple, 
and therefore were guilty of sacrilege: “The money,” he says, 
“ which was given for the use of the Temple they convert for the 
purchase of a lie, as before they had given thirty pieces of silver to 
the traitor Judas.” 

Saying, Say ye that His disciples came by night \ &c By their 
perversity, says S. Chrysostom, the High Priests increased the 
faith which they endeavoured to extinguish, for they speak things 
impossible and incredible. For first, says Remigius, “ If the soldiers 
slept, how could they see the theft ? ” 

Secondly, The disciples were afraid and had fled; how, then, 
would they have dared to steal the body of Christ, which they 
knew to be guarded by so many soldiers ? 

Thirdly, It is incredible that Roman soldiers, who were so faith-

ful and watchful, should all have slept at the sepulchre of Christ, 
especially when they knew that their own lives were in danger. 
And let it be granted that they all slept, they would certainly 
have been awakened by the noise caused by the removal of the 
stone. So S. Chrysostom says, “ How should the disciples carry 
Him away by stealth, who did not dare to show themselves? 
They fled when they saw Him alive; how, when He was dead, 
would they not have feared the soldiers ? And why did they not 
rather steal the body on the first night, when there was no one 
there? Truly they confirm the truth of the resurrection, for they 
confess that the body was not in the sepulchre . 19 

And if this come to the governor’s ears , &c. That is, we will 
persuade Pilate that your sleep and negligence in guarding the 
body of Christ was a light matter, and that no harm can happen 
from it ; for he knows that this business does not concern himself, 
but us, and so he, to please us and against his own conscience, 
condemned Jesus to be crucified ; for if he was so yielding when 
he unjustly condemned Jesus, in compliance with our urgent 
request, he will be much more yielding in absolving you at our 
request But the soldiers secretly disclosed the whole matter to 
Pilate, and confirmed the truth of Christ's resurrection, and Pilate 
wrote the account to Tiberius, who forthwith was desirous of 
enrolling Christ among the gods. So Hegesippus relates from 
the acts of Pilate himself. “The chief of the Jews,” Pilate says, 
“falsely asserted to me that Jesus was a sorcerer, and had broken 
their law. And I believed that it was so, and delivered Him to 
be scourged, according to their will ; but they crucified Him, and 
set a watch at the sepulchre. But He rose again on the third day, 
while my soldiers were keeping watch. But the wickedness of the 
Jews was inflamed to such a pitch that they gave money to the 
watch, and said, Say ye that His disciples stole away His body. 
But when they had received the money they were not able to be 
silent about what had been done ; for they testified that they had 
seen Him rise, and that they had received money from the Jews. 
I have therefore made a statement of these things, that no one

may falsely allege otherwise, and suppose that credit ought to be 
given to the falsehoods of the Jews.” 

So they took the money, and did as they were taught \ and this 
saying is commonly reported among the Jews unto this day . That 
is, among the common people and those of little sense; for the 
wiser men easily saw through the deceit, and found out the whole 
matter in secret from the soldiers. Moreover, Longinus, the cen- 
turion, asserted that Christ had risen, and on that account died as 
a martyr for Him. But this false story was chiefly confuted by 
the Apostles, who affirmed that Christ had appeared alive again to 
them, and who confirmed the same by many miracles. It is also 
confuted by Josephus, although he was of the nation and sect of 
the Jews. Let the Jews then listen to him, and believe one of 
their own nation, though they will not believe Christ For thus he 
writes (. Antiq ., book 18, cfu 4), “At the same time lived Jesus, a 
wise man — if it is right to speak of Him as a man. For He was 
a performer of wonderful works, and a Teacher of those who 
willingly received Him, and had very many followers both from 
among the Jews and the Greeks. This was Christ whom, on 
His being accused by the chiefs of our nation, Pilate had sen* 
tenced to the Cross ; yet those who had begun to love Him from 
the first, did not cease to do so. For He appeared to them on 
the third day alive, for the Prophets had foretold this and many 
other wonderful things concerning Him. And to this very day 
the body of Christians, so called from Him, still continue.” 

Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee . Matthew omits 
the rest of Christ’s appearances, and mentions only that one which 
took place in Galilee, because it had been promised both by the 
angel and by Christ, and because it took place publicly before 
five hundred brethren, as Paul says (1 Cor. xv. 6). For all the 
disciples, of whom He had very many in Galilee, were assembled 
there, according to the command of Christ, because they were 
safer there than in Judaea from the persecution of the Jews. 

To a mountain . It is certain that this mountain was not the 
Mount of Olives, from which, in the presence of His disciples

MEANING OF GALILEE. 349 

Christ ascended into Heaven. For the Mount of Olives is in 
Judaea, and not in Galilee. Dionysius, S. Bonaventura, and others 
think it very probable that this mountain was Tabor, where Christ 
in His transfiguration had shown His glory to Peter, James, and 
John. 

Mystically : S. Jerome says, ‘‘Galilee was the abode of all vices, 
where before were error and deceit, and it behoved that it should 
be illuminated by the presence and glory of Christ.” Again, Bede 
says, “The Lord now had passed from death unto life, from cor- 
ruption to incorruption ; for Galilee is the same as transmigration.” 

Allegorically: S. Augustine (de Cons . Evan., lib. 3) says, “ Galilee 
is the same as transmigration, from the Heb. galal, because the 
grace of Christ was about to pass over from the people of Israel 
to the Gentiles; whence He says, ‘I will go before you into 
Galilee/ because they would not believe when the Apostles should 
preach the Gospel to them, unless the Lord Himself should first 
make ready their way in the hearts of men. ‘ There shall ye see 
Him ;* that is, there shall ye find His members.” 

Anagogically: S. Augustine, in the same place, says, “Galilee in 
Hebrew also signifies ‘revelation/ whence it represents Heaven 
and the beatific vision. That revelation will be the true Galilee : 
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him there as He is. That 
will be the more blessed passing from this world to that eternity, 
if we so embrace His commandments that we merit to be set on 
His right hand.” 

And when they saw Him t they worshipped Him, but some doubted. 
Not of the eleven Apostles, but of the other disciples. For all the 
Apostles had now been confirmed by so many visions and proofs, 
that they did not doubt that Christ had risen. Or if any one 
prefers to refer this expression to the Apostles, it must be under- 
stood as meaning, They had before doubted, but were not now 
in doubt. So Theophylact says, “You ought to understand it as 
meaning that when they were come into Galilee they worshipped 
Him ; but they who worshipped Him in Galilee had first doubted 
in Jerusalem.”

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVIII. 


Moreover, Christ appeared in the same form as He had when 
He was alive, so that He was recognised by the Apostles as the 
same and not another. Whereupon He veiled His brightness, for 
the weak eyes of mortal men would not have been able to bear it. 
S. Augustine (de Civ. Dei , 22, c. 19) says, “We must believe that 
the brightness which Christ’s body had when He rose was veiled 
from the eyes of the disciples.” 

And Jesus came and spake to them , &c Maldonatus and others 
are of opinion that these things were not done and said by Christ 
now when He appeared in Galilee, but at the last appearance 
which took place on the Mount of Olives. For Christ seems 
there to have said His last farewell to His Apostles, and to have 
given them His last commands; and to have sent them forth as 
His ambassadors to evangelise the world, which He did at His 
ascension. 

Is given to Me. That is, to Me alone ; and that both because 
I am the Son of God and God, for from eternity has been given 
to Me by the Father, with the divine essence, all power and 
majesty ; and also because I am man (as S. Cyril, Athanasius, 
and others say). It was given to Me inchoately in My incarnation 
on account of the dignity of the hypostatic union with the Word ; 
and it was given to Me in its fulness by God on account of the 
merits of My Passion, when having overcome death, sin, hell, and 
the devil, as the Redeemer of men, I obtained full right and 
dominion over them at the price of My blood. 

Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, &c. Hence, according to 
the tradition of the Church, it is well known that this is the form 
of baptism, “ I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; " in which we profess our faith in the 
Holy Trinity and in the Divine Unity, saying, in the Name, not 
in the Names. Hence S. Isidore (lib. 7, EiymoL c. 4) says, “ It is 
called a Trinity, because One Whole is constituted of Three, as it 
were a Tri-unity, resembling memory, intelligence, and will, in 
which the mind has in itself a certain image of the Divine Trinity ; 
for since They are Three, They are One.” Whence, in opposition

CHRIST’S PERPETUAL PRESENCE.

to the Arians, Macedonians, Nestorians, and other heretics, it is 
clear that the Son is true God, and of one substance (fo oou<no>) 
with the Father and the Holy Spirit, as S. Athanasius, Augustine, 
Hilary, and others teach. Christ, therefore, here most clearly 
expresses the mystery of the Holy Trinity, which Moses obscurely 
shadowed forth in the Old Testament, lest the ignorant Jew's 
should believe that the Three Persons were Three Gods, and so 
after their custom worship a plurality of Gods. 

Morally; Learn here that it is a divine work to teach and 
convert all nations, even rude and barbarous ones. Whence S. 
Gregory ( Horn . 12 , in Ezek.), “There is no sacrifice so acceptable 
to Almighty God as a zeal for souls.” That saying also of 
Dionysius the Areopagite is well known, “ Of all divine works, the 
most divine is to co-operate with God in the conversion of the 
wanderers, and in the bringing back of sinners to Himself.” 

Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever 1 have commanded 
you . That is, all the commandments which I have enjoined in 
the Gospel ; for faith alone does not suffice for salvation, but the 
keeping of the commandments is required, and the constant prac- 
tice of virtues. For not the hearers of the law are just before God \ 
but the doers of the law shall be justified (Rom. ii.). 

And, behold, 1 am with you always, even unto the end of the world. 
Although I ascend into Heaven, I will not forsake you, whom I am 
sending abroad over the whole world. / am with you, both as 
God and as man, by present help, grace, consolation, guidance, 
deliverance, which I will always bestow upon you and your suc- 
cessors ; by means of which I will make all difficult things easy to 
you, says S. Chrysostom, so that out of all nations ye may gather 
together for Me a Church, that is, a company of faithful and holy 
men. And I am with you unto the end of the world. This world 
shall come to an end sooner than My presence in the Church shall 
fail. “He who promises,” says S. Jerome, “that He will be with 
His disciples to the end of the world, shows both that they shall 
live for ever (in their successors), and that He will never depart 
from them that believe.”

S. MATTHEW, C. XXVIIL 


“Do not fear,” says Prosper (lib. 2, de Vocal . Gent c. 1), “because 
of your own weakness, but have confidence in My power, for I will 
not leave you in the performance of this work. Not that ye shall 
be without suffering, but, which is a much greater thing, I will take 
care that ye be not overcome by any cruelty of them that rage 
against you.” 

This is what Christ promised to His Apostles before His death 
(John xvl 16), I will pray the Father, and Be will give you another 
Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever , even the Spirit of 
Truth. For the gifts of the Holy Spirit and of Christ are the same, 
since the Deity of each and the operation of each is the same. 
For the external works of the Holy Trinity are undivided; and 
that which One Person works, the other Two also work. To 
the Holy Spirit, however, who proceeds forth as love, are fitly 
attributed the works of grace and holiness. So Christ was visibly 
present with Paul (Acts xxiL 17), and S. Stephen in his martyrdom 
(Acts vii.). 

For this reason, likewise, Christ has willed to abide continually 
in the Church in the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist For as the 
humanity and deity of Christ are present in glory in Heaven, and 
are adored visibly by the angels and saints, so are the same likewise 
present in the Eucharist, but hidden under the forms of bread and 
wine, and therefore invisible, and are there adored, and even par- 
taken of by the faithful. Wherefore it is Christ who, by the 
ministry of every priest, performs daily that miracle of miracles, 
namely, the wonderful conversion of the bread and wine into the 
body and blood of the Lord, which theologians call transubstantia- 
tion; for neither man, nor angel, nor created power could effect 
this. He Himself therefore, in it offers Himself as an unbloody 
victim to the Father. 

Tropologically : Christ is in and with the faithful soul even to 
the end of life, granting to it that great gift of perseverance, 
by which the elect are brought to Heaven. For He does not 
desert the just man, unless He first be deserted by him. Where- 
fore Christ is in a holy soul, first, politically , as it were a king

in his kingdom, inasmuch as He directs and rules it aright accord- 
ing to the laws of justice 

Secondly, He is in the soul economically , as a father in a house 
and family, which he rules wisely; He is what a charioteer is in 
a chariot, so that we ought ever to be crying out to Him, as 
Elisha did to Elijah when he was being carried up into Heaven, 
My Fat her , the chariot of Israel and the charioteer (Vulg.) thereof 
Thirdly, Christ is in the soul ethically , in the manner of reason 
and prudence, which prudently directs all its actions, according 
to the rule of divine reason and eternal law which is in the mind 
of God 

Fourthly, He is in the soul physically that which the soul 
is in the body; for He is, as it were, the soul of the soul, Him- 
self the life-giving life of grace, in order that the soul may live 
not an animal and carnal life, but a spiritual and divine one 

Lastly, He is, as it were, a divine fire, kindling the soul with 
the dame of charity. He is in the soul what the sun is in the 
world, making it fruitful in good works, according to that saying, 
He worketh in us to will and to do (Phil. ii.). And, He worketh 
all things in all according to the purpose of His own will (Eph. i.). 
It is He who inspires our words with power, in order that they 
may be effectual to the conversion of the hearers from sin to 
holiness, according to that saying of Paul, 1 have planted , Apollos 
watered \ but God gave the increase (i Cor. iii.). Therefore, O wise 
and holy soul, go forth to meet thy God with love and desire. Thy 
Jesus desires to be with thee ; do thou in thy turn desire to be with 
nought but Jesus. His delights are with thee ; let thy delights be 
with Him. Suffer thyself, therefore, to be ruled and guided by 
Him, as a kingdom suffers itself to be ruled by its king, an army 
by its leader, a chariot by its charioteer, the will by the reason, the 
body by the soul, the world by the sun. M Thou art sufficient for 
God,” says S. Augustine ; “ let thy God be sufficient for thee.”

COMMENTARY 


UPON 

THE GOSPEL OF S. MARK. 


INTRODUCTION. 

M TV /T ARK,” says S. Jerome in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical 

iVA Writers , “was a disciple and interpreter of S. Peter. 
At the request of the brethren at Rome, he wrote a short Gospel, 
based upon what he had heard S. Peter relate. This, when Peter 
had heard, he approved of, and sanctioned its being read in the 
Church.” Shortly afterwards, S. Jerome proceeds to say, “Mark 
took his Gospel, which he had compiled, and went to Egypt 
He first preached Christ at Alexandria, and founded a Church 
there, which possessed such great purity of doctrine and life that 
it influenced all followers of Christ by its example. In short, 
Philo, the most eloquent of the Jews, beholding the primitive 
Church of Alexandria, as yet Judaizing, wrote a book upon its 
peculiarities, as it were in praise of his own people. And similarly 
as S. Luke records that at Jerusalem those who believed had all 
things common, so has Philo preserved the memory of what he 
saw at Alexandria under S. Mark as the teacher of the Christians. 
He died in the eighth year of Nero, and was buried at Alexandria. 
Anianus succeeded him.” 

Clement of Alexandria {Strom. /. vi.) and Papias of Hierapolis 
attest the same things; so does Eusebius ( H \ E. iL 15), who adds

S. MARK. 


that S Peter confirmed S. Mark’s Gospel, and delivered it to be 
read for all time in the Churches. S. Athanasius ( Synops \ sub fin.) 
and S. Epiphanius (Harts. 51) say the same Wherefore Tertullian 
(/. iv. coni . Marcion) attributes the Gospel of S. Mark to S. Peter, 
because, as S. Jerome says, “ it was compiled from what S. Peter 
related, Mark being the writer.” The same S. Jerome, or whoever 
is the author of the preface to his Commentary on S. Mark, says, 
“After Matthew soweth Mark, He, I say, who roareth as a lion, 
who fiieth as an eagle, who leameth as a man, who sacrificeth as 
a priest, who watereth as a river, who flourished! as a field, who 
fermenteth as wine For Christ who is spoken of is man by 
being bom, is a calf by dying, a lion by rising again, an eagle by 
ascending into heaven.” 

For this cause the cherubim of Ezek. i. and the Apocalypse, 
which have four faces, signify the four Evangelists. For the face 
of a man denotes Matthew, who relates the works of Christ’s 
humanity ; the face of an eagle, John, who speaks of the divinity 
of Christ; the face of an ox denotes Luke, who begins with the 
priesthood of Zacharias; and the face of a lion designates Mark, 
because he begins his Gospel from the loud roaring of John the 
Baptist, as it were of a lion. For these four have drawn the 
chariot of the glory of God, the chariot of the Gospel, through the 
whole world, and have subdued all nations to Him, that He may 
triumph. 

The name Mark happily agrees with this symbolism, whether we 
derive it from the Hebrew or from Latin. For Mark in Hebrew, 
says Pagninus (in interpret Heb. now in.), means the same as 
smoothed , polished, cleansed from rust. It is derived from plO, 
marak, to clean, to polish. As Jeremiah (xlvl 4) says, “Stand 
in the helmets, polish the lances;” where for polish the Heb. 
has p"10, mircu, polish ye. Thus S. Mark polished the lance of 
his Gospel and preaching, that it, like a lion, might subdue the 
Egyptians and other nations to Christ. But S. Isidore (L vil 
Origen, c. 9) says, “ Mark means high in commandment ” (but I 
know not from what root), that is to say, on account of the 


Digitized by ^ooQle 


INTRODUCTION. 


357 


Gospel of the Most High , which he preached. Again, the Heb. of 
Mark may be, as it were, DID "ID, mar cos, or the Lord of the 
Chalice , that is to say, of suffering and martyrdom. 

But in Latin, Carolus Signonius (de Horn. Roman.) says, “ He is 
called Marcus who is bom in the month of March." But Isidore 
says Mark means a strong hammer , Marcellus is a moderate-sized 
hammer, and Marculus a little one. Thus S. Mark was a mighty 
and strong hammer , breaking in pieces the rock, i.e. 9 bruising with 
compunction the strong hearts of the Gentiles, and moving them 
to repentance and a Christian life. Mark , then, and Marcellus are 
the same as Martellus , a hammer. So Charles, the grandfather of 
Charlemagne, was called Charles Martel, because of his warlike 
prowess, by which he crushed a host of 300,000 Saracens. Or 
Marcus may be taken to be the same as Martins, a sort of 
heavenly Mars. The Marcian gens at Rome, an ancient patrician 
family, was so called from Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of 
Rome. King Ancus was called the sacrificial \ because he restored 
worship which had fallen into decay, or had been improperly per- 
formed. 

How religious and brave S. Mark was appears from the insti- 
tution of the Essaei,* who were the first religious, and the prototypes 
of all religious, of whose wondrous sanctity more anon. 

Lastly, the Romans used to give the prcenomen Marcus to first- 
born sons. Marcus Tullius Cicero was so called because he was 
a first-bom son. Thus Mark was a first-bom son, and singularly 
beloved of S. Peter. Thus he speaks of him as Marcus , my son 
(1 Pet v.). For he as a son had drunk of S. Peter's spirit, and 
was an express image of the wisdom and holiness of S. Peter. 

You will ask, Of what country, who, and what was S. Mark? I 
answer: 1. That he was of the Hebrew nation, and of the tribe 
of Levi. Bede adds that he was a priest, of the family of Aaron. 

2. Theophilus, Victor of Antioch, and Euthymius think that 
this Mark was the same as John Mark, who was nephew of 


* The Christian Essenes of Alexandria (Trans.).

S. MARK. 


Barnabas, and who journeyed with him and & Paul to preach the 
Gospel to the Gentiles, the same S. Mark as he to whom S. Paul 
refers in his Epistle to Philemon, and Col. iv., and 2 Tim. iv. 
But I say that this Mark was a different person from John 
Mark, for at the same time that John Mark was with Paul and 
Barnabas in Greece, this Mark was with S. Peter at Rome, and 
was sent by him to preach first at Aquileia, and afterwards at 
Alexandria. 

3. Origen (lib. de Recta Fide\ S. Epiphanius (/fares. 51), and 
Dorotheus (in Synops.) think that Mark was one of Christ's seventy- 
two disciples. But the contrary, namely, that he was converted 
and baptized by S. Peter after Christ's death, is more probable; 
For he calls him his (spiritual) son (1 Pet v. 13), “The Church 
which is at Babylon saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son.* 
So S. Jerome, Eusebius (H. E. vii. 14), &c, who say that S. Mark 
was a disciple and companion of §. Peter. 

4. S. Austin (/. 1, de Cons . Evang. c. 2) calls Mark the abbre- 
viator of Matthew, not because he made a compendium of his 
Gospel, as some say, but because he often relates more briefly, as 
he had received them from S. Peter, the things which Matthew 
records at greater length. I said “often," for occasionally Mark 
relates events in the life of Christ more fully than Matthew does, 
as is plain from the account of Peter's denial. Some things also 
he unfolds with greater clearness than Matthew. Mark is fuller 
in narrative than Matthew, but has less of Christ's doctrine. 
Mark’s, therefore, is an independent Gospel. Whence the Arabic 
prefixes the following title to his Gospel : — In the name of the 
Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , One God \ the Gospel 
of the Father , Patriarchy Apostle , & Mar (i.e., Lord) Mark the 
Evangelist. 

5. Mark wrote this Gospel a.d. 45, in the third year of the 
reign of Claudius, as Eusebius says (in Chron.\ shortly before he 
went to Alexandria, where he governed for nineteen years the 
Church which he there founded. His disciples were so excellent 
that they were called Essaei, that is, holy and pious. For they, as

INTRODUCTION.

the first religious, lived in such purity and holiness as to become 
the admiration of the whole world, and afforded a mirror of per- 
fection to all other Churches. Hence S. Jerome and Cassian call 
S. Mark the chief and founder of the Coenobites. See what I have 
said concerning the Essaei in Acts v. 2. 

Moreover, S. Mark founded the first Christian school at Alex- 
andria, from which so many holy doctors, bishops, and martyrs 
proceeded. This school of Alexandria wonderfully flourished under 
the Emperor Commodus, a.d. 180, when Pantaenus presided over 
it. Pantaenus was succeeded by Clement, Clement by Origen. 

Finally, S. Mark added to the laurels of an Apostle, Doctor, and 
Evangelist the crown of martyrdom. In the Roman Martyrology 
for the 25th of April we read concerning him thus, 41 At Alexandria, 
the natal day of B. Mark the Evangelist, he, for the faith of Christ, 
being stretched and bound with cords, was dragged over the rocks, 
and grievously tormented. Afterwards, being shut up in prison, he 
was first comforted by an angelic vision, and at last by the appear- 
ance of the Lord Himself, by whom he was called to the heavenly 
kingdom in the eighth year of Nera” The body of S. Mark was 
translated by merchants from Alexandria to Venice* A.D. 827. 
There it is cherished with the utmost veneration, insomuch that 
the Senate have adopted as their insignia a lion, the emblem of 
S. Mark; and when they issue any command, they call it the 
mandate of S. Mark. 

You will ask, secondly, in what language Mark wrote his Gospel,— 
in Latin or Greek? Many think he wrote it in Latin. And the 
reason seems plain. For Mark wrote at Rome for the Romans; 
therefore, say they, he must have written in the Latin tongue. For 
the Romans did not understand Greek (as Baronius abundantly 
proves) in a.d. 45. For although S. Chrysostom on Mark asserts 
that he wrote his Gospel at Alexandria, yet S. Jerome, Eusebius, 
Clement, and other Fathers declare, passim, that he wrote it at 
Rome. And the author of that Commentary upon S. Mark was 
not S. Chrysostom, as I will prove hereafter. So the Syriac 
version, which at the end of S. Mark’s Gospel adds expressly, 


Digitized by ^ooQle 


S. MARK. 


360 

“Here endeth the holy Gospel, the Gospel of Mark, which he 
spake and preached at Rome, in the Roman language.” S. 
Gregory Nazianzen, in the poem in which he gives a catalogue 
of Holy Scripture, thus assigns the Evangelists to languages and 
nations, — 

“ The wonders of Christ for the Hebrews S. Matthew did write 5 
S. Mark for Westerns ; for Greeks S. Luke in learning bright 5 * 

For all S. John, who soared aloft with heavenly sight” 

On the other hand, S. Jerome affirms expressly, in the preface 
to the Gospel, that Mark wrote in Greek. “I am speaking,” he 
says, “of the New Testament, which, without doubt, was written 
in Greek, with the exception of the Apostle Matthew, who first in 
Judaea published the Gospel of Christ in Hebrew.” And he adds 
that he for this reason, at the command of Pope Damasus, cor- 
rected the ancient Latin Vulgate version of the New Testament, 
and therefore of S. Mark’s Gospel, in accordance with the Greek 
original. S. Augustine teaches us the same thing: “Matthew is 
said to have written in Hebrew, all the rest in Greek.” The same 
was the common opinion of ancient and modem writers. 

Reason favours the same view. For S. Mark wrote his Gospel 
when he was about to pass to Alexandria, that he might preach 
it there. But the inhabitants of Alexandria spoke at that time 
the Greek language. For Alexandria was founded, and its name 
given, by Alexander the Great SS. Athanasius and Cyril, 
Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria, and the rest wrote in Greek. 
Again, Mark was more skilled in Greek than he was in Latin. 
Wherefore, also, the Greek text of his Gospel is more polished and 
elegant than the Latin. For the Jews, who were neighbours of 
Greek-speaking countries, and subjects of Alexander the Great 
and his successors, learned thoroughly the Greek language, but 
not so the Latin, as being far distant from Latin-speaking 
countries. Moreover, the Greek language was then very widely 
diffused, as Cicero says. For this reason the Romans, especially 
the patricians and the wealthier sort of people, were skilled in 
Greek. Indeed, they sent their sons to Athens that they might

INTRODUCTION. 


361 


be thoroughly grounded in Grecian wisdom and eloquence. And 
Mark wrote this Gospel not for the Roman plebeians, but for 
patricians and nobles, for such persons as S. Clement, S. Pudens. 
Listen to Clement of Alexandria {tom. 6, in Biblioth. Patr. in 
Edit Parisiensi .), “Mark, the follower of Peter, when Peter was 
preaching the Gospel publicly at Rome, in the presence of certain 
knights of Caesar’s household, and was advancing many testimonies 
about Christ, being requested by them, wrote from the things 
which were spoken by Peter a Gospel, which is called that accord- 
ing to Mark.” In like manner S. Paul wrote his Epistle to 
the Romans in Greek, as I have shown in my preface to that 
Epistle. 

Lastly, S. Mark was present with S. Peter at Antioch, where the 
disciples of Christ were first called Christians. And at Antioch 
Greek was spoken. Hence Greek was more familiar to Mark than 
Latin, and it is possible that Greek was his mother tongue. For 
although the Apostles and primitive believers received the gift of 
tongues from the Holy Spirit, yet they received it for sufficiency, 
not for elegance, and so they spoke each their own vernacular 
better and more elegantly. 

You will reconcile both opinions if you say that Mark wrote 
his Gospel both in Greek and Latin, as Genebrard thinks, and 
our Barradi {tom. 1, /. 1, c. 19) and Possevin. Hear Peter Natalis 
{in Cat Sand. L 4, c. 86), “Peter sent Mark to Aquileia as its 
first bishop. There he wrote again his Gospel in Greek, which 
he had previously written in Latin at Rome, which Gospel, 
together with the ivory chair in which he sat to write it, is still 
shown in the church of Aquileia.” 

Further, some imagine that the Latin original of Mark has 
perished through the injuries of time, as the Hebrew Gospel of 
Matthew has perished. But it is difficult to believe so. For how 
would the Roman Church, so faithful to her trust, and so care- 
ful a guardian of the sacred writings, and especially in those 
early ages from Mark to Constantine, when it was so ardent and 
constant in zeal for religion, have suffered so great a treasure

committed to her to be lost? Surely she who kept so faithfully 
what pertained to others did not lose her own. What, did so 
many copies of the Gospel of S. Mark, which noble Romans and 
other Italians, converted to Christ by SS. Peter and Paul, would 
emulously cause to be transcribed, perish to a single copy, so that 
not even one has survived ? Wherefore we shall say, with greater 
probability, that Mark, for the reasons already assigned, wrote 
originally in Greek, but immediately afterwards, either by himself 
or by some other translator, rendered the Greek into Latin, and 
delivered both to the Romans, in a similar way to S. Paul, who 
wrote his Epistle to the Romans in Greek, but sent the same to 
them translated into Latin by Tertius, his scribe and interpreter. 
The reasons are — ist Because SS. Jerome and Austin affirm that 
Mark wrote in Greek, not in Latin, and. Because, as Bellarmine 
has lightly perceived ( de Script Eccles. in Afarc.\ it is evident, 
from a collation of the Greek and Latin texts, that the Old Latin 
and the Vulgate editions, both of Matthew and Mark, have been 
translated from the Greek. This is proved by Franc. Lucas by 
many examples. To these you may add that the Latin translator 
of Mark Grecized, as when he says (iL a) ct convenerunt multi* 
ita ut non caperet neque ad januam , words which are obscurely 
translated into Latin from the Greek, which reads clearly and 

elegantly, «<rri p\ jxtn rd nj* Otyav, #>., so that 

not even the places about the door could contain the crowd. Again, 
in iv. io, the Vulgate has, et cum esset singularis, whilst the Greek 
is plain, xara,a6tag t ie. } alone . Also vil 17, 18, 20, Qua de homine 
exeunt , ilia communicant hominem , the Gr. xmoT 9 i.e., make a man 
common or unclean , is clear. For the Hebrews call common 
unclean things, that is, things which all, even the impure, use 
promiscuously and in common. So, again, in chap. i. 47, &a<^- 
fi /£•#» is translated verbally, diffamare , to make known abroad.

that they cannot be deciphered. When I was inquiring about 
the matter at Rome, several reliable persons, who had carefully 
investigated the subject, wrote to me to this effect, that the 
following is the tradition among the Venetians. They say that 
this Gospel was written by S. Mark at Aquileia, and left by 
him there, and that it was brought from thence to Venice. For 
when Attila took Aquileia after a three years* siege, and destroyed 
it, many of the inhabitants fled to the marshes bordering on the 
Adriatic, and there, in a marvellous manner, laid the foundations 
of Venice, a.d. 452. Moreover, a trustworthy man, a canon of 
S. Mark’s at Venice, who has the custody of this relic, and is 
therefore an eye-witness, wrote to me in answer to my inquiries, 
within the last few days, that this autograph of S. Mark is written 
in Greek, and was brought from Aquileia to Venice a.d. 1472. 

Pagnini has written a dissertation on this question, dedicated 
to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, in which he maintains that S. 
Mark in the first instance wrote his Gospel in Latin at Rome, and 
afterwards in Greek at Aquileia, but that the Latin has been lost, 
since the present Latin of S. Mark is a translation from the Greek. 
He cites many passages which go to prove the great prevalence 
of Greek at Rome in those times. He also cites Damasus as 
saying (lib. de Vit. Potit.) in the Life of S. Peter , that the 
Evangelists wrote in Latin (mentioning Mark), in Greek, and 
Hebrew. But it is well known that this work is not by Damasus, 
but by Anastasius, the librarian. What Pagnini adds, that S. 
Peter preached to the Romans in Greek, and that S. Mark, as 
his interpreter, rendered his words into Latin, cannot be consi- 
dered worthy of credit Besides, the duty of an interpreter was diffe- 
rent from this, as I have shown on 1 Cor. xil 10. 

The Syrians, as Fabricius tells us in the preface to his Syriac 
New Testament, assert that Mark wrote in Latin. They also say 
that the same Mark translated not only his own Gospel into his 
Galilean or Syriac mother tongue, but all the other books of the 
New Testament. 

But it is difficult to believe this. For there is no mention of

S. MARK. 


3<54 

such a translation by Clement of Alexandria, or Origen, Eusebius, 
Athanasius, Epiphanius, Cyril, Theodoret, S. Jerome, or other 
Fathers, who either were Syrians, or who lived in Syria and 
Egypt, and treated carefully the subject of the various editions 
and translations of the Holy Scriptures. Therefore this Syriac 
translation of the New Testament seems to have been made later 
than S. Mark’s time. 

Lastly, S. Mark’s Gospel has always been reckoned amongst the 
canonical Scriptures, with the exception of the last chapter, doubts 
about which were formerly entertained by some, as S. Jerome 
testifies (Ep. 150, ad Hedib. q. 3), because it contained certain 
things which savoured of Manichaeism, which S. Jerome recites 
(lib. 2, con t. Pelag.). The words were these, “And they were 
satisfied, saying, Substance is that world of iniquity and unbelief 
which suffereth not through wicked spirits the true power of God 
to be apprehended : therefore now call back thy righteousness. * 
But these words have been since removed. 

Observe Mark’s whole strength is given to narration, and does 
not care for the order in which things were done. Hence he 
places events which were done afterwards before some which were 
prior to them in order of time, and vice versa . Hear S. Jerome 
(Introd. to S. Matt L), “ Second, Mark, the interpreter of the Apostle 
Peter, who indeed had not himself seen the Lord, the Saviour, 
but had heard his master’s preaching, related according to the 
truth of the things which were done, rather than the order in 
which they were done.” 

There is extant a second volume of S. Chrysostom’s Com- 
mentary upon S. Mark, which, although not devoid of genius, 
learning, and piety, nevertheless seems to be wanting in the style, 
spirit, and subtlety of S. Chrysostom. Hence Bellarmine says 
that it is undoubtedly not the work of that Saint, but of a certain 
simple monk, who expounded the Gospel to his brethren. 

Victor of Antioch, an ancient author, wrote especially upon S. 
Mark, whom one Theodore Peltanus has translated out of Greek 
into Latin.

The author of the Commentary or Scholiast upon S. Mark in 
the works of S. Jerome is not S. Jerome himself for he shows 
himself to be unskilled both in Greek and Hebrew. 

Here only a few things occur to be noted, because most have 
been spoken of in S. Matthew. There the reader will find them 
annotated. Here, therefore, I shall be brief.

6. MARK, C. I. 


CHAPTER I* 

I The office of John the Baptist. 9 Jesus is baptised , 12 tempted: 14 he preaeketk: 
16 calleth Peter , Andrew^ James , and John : 23 healeth one that had a devil^ 
29 Peter’s mother-in-law , 32 many diseased persons , 41 and cleanse th the leper. 

The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christy the Son of God, as 
it is written in Isaias , &c. Many place a full stop before as % 
thinking that the beginning of the Gospel \ &c., is the title of the 
book. But that these words are not the title, but the introduction 
of the book, is plain from the word beginnings and because they 
are really dependent upon the clause as it is written, &c. 
Therefore a comma, not a period, amust be placed before as. 
The word Gospel \ then, in this place does not denote the book 
of the Gospel which Mark wrote, as when we say, the Gospel of 
Mark , but the Gospel preaching of Jesus Christ as it follows. 
The meaning, therefore, is, “The Gospel preaching of Christ 
had such a beginning as Isaiah and Malachi foretold, that is 
to say, the preaching of John the Baptist and his testimony 
concerning Christ.” For John began to preach the kingdom of 
heaven, that it would be opened by Christ’s preaching and death. 
Wherefore he urged them to repentance, that they might be 
capable of receiving the grace of Christ, saying, Repent ye, &c. 
For Moses and the ancient Law preached and promised a land 
flowing with milk and honey, if the Jews would obey God’s 
commandments. But Christ and the Evangelical Law preach

S. JOHN’S PREACHING.

and promise the kingdom of heaven, if men will repent of their 
sins, and obey the commands of Christ. John’s preaching of 
repentance, therefore, was the preparation for, and the beginning 
of, Christ’s preaching the GospeL 

Observe, Matthew and John commence their Gospels from 
Christ Himself — John from the divine, Matthew from the human 
generation of Christ Mark and Luke begin with John the 
Baptist — Luke from his nativity, Mark from his preaching. 

Vers, a, 3. As it is written in Isaias the prophet \ Behold, I send 
my angel before Thy face , who shall prepare the way before Thu. A 
voice of one crying in the desert t Prepare ye the way of the Lord , 
make straight His paths. The former citation in the 2nd verse is 
from Mai iii. 1. The latter is from Isa. xl. 3. Wherefore the 
Greek has, it is written in the prophets . But the Vulgate and 
some Greek copies, also the Syriac and Arabic, have as above. 
And S. Jerome says that this was formerly the reading of the 
Greek (lib. de Opt. Gen. Interpret. Scrip. \ 

You will ask, “Why does Mark only cite Isaias and not 
Malachi?” I answer, because the prophecy of Isaias is of 
greatest importance in this place, for the voice of John crying in 
the desert, Do penance , &c., was the beginning of the Gospel. But 
inasmuch as Malachi shows that John was not sent by man, but 
by God, to utter these words, therefore Mark prefixes the words 
of Malachi to arouse the attention of the reader to receive and 
venerate the voice of John. Besides, Malachi in reality says 
the same as Isaias. For the angel sent by God to prepare the 
way of Christ was none other than John himself, crying , and 
preaching repentance, by which the hearts of men must be pre- 
pared for the preaching and grace of Christ This is therefore, 
as it were, one and the same oracle of two prophets, uttered 
concerning one and the same John, but in different words, so that 
they mutually confirm and explain one another. This, then, is 
the reason why Mark in this place, and the other Evangelists and 
Apostles, when they cite two prophets, or two or more sentences 
of the same or different books of the Old Testament, quote them

S. MARK, C. I. 


as one and the same testimony. This is plain from i Pet iL 7, 
compared with Ps. cxviii. 22 and Isa. viii. 14. Also 1 Cor. xv. 54, 
compared with Isa. xxv. 8 and Hos. xiii. 14. The reason, I say, 
is, because one sentence confirms and explains the other, so that 
they are in truth not two, but one sentence. 

Ver. 4. John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the 
baptism of penance unto remission of sins . That this remission 
was to be received from Christ and His baptism, which was 
the perfection and consummation of John’s baptism. For Christ, 
as it were the King of Heaven, preached that the kingdom must 
be received by His grace, of which the first part is remission of 
sins, which is given by the baptism of Christ, inasmuch as it is 
furnished and, as it were, animated by the Spirit and grace of 
Christ, according to those words of John (in Matt \ iii. n), “I 
indeed baptize you in water unto penance, but He that shall come 
after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear ; 
He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.” 

And immediately the Spirit drove (Gr. ix/SaAAi/, Le., sends out , 
expels ) Him out into the desert The Spirit \ i.e., the Holy Spirit, 
who a little while before had glided down upon Him in His 
baptism in the form of a dove. Drove, that is, impelled Christ 
with great power of spirit and ardour, that He should, of His 
own accord, go into the desert, and there, as in a palcestra, 
match Himself in single combat with the devil. 

And He was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and 
was tempted (Gr. vttgago/tmc, i.e., suffering temptation). Whence 
many think that Christ during the forty days was frequently 
tempted by Satan, by means of various spectres and horrible 
monsters, such as the demon presented to S. Anthony, to terrify 
him and distract his mind from prayer. So Franc. Lucas. But 
it seems better to take Mark as speaking only of the three well- 
known temptations (see what has been said in Matt iv. 2). 

And He was with beasts (Gr. Aig/w, wild beasts). This is an 
intimation of the excessive solitude of the place, as well as of 
Christ’s innocency. Although He was in such a desert place,

CHRIST FLEES FROM HEROD.

with lions, wolves, leopards, serpents, yet He did not fear 
them, nor was He injured by them. Just as Adam, so long 
as he was innocent, lived with such creatures without harm in 
Paradise. For they all looked up to him, and reverenced him as 
their lord. 

And the angels ministered to Him. Not before His temptation 
and victory, as Bede supposes. For if so, Jesus would have been 
recognised by the devil as the Son of God ; nor would the devil 
have dared to approach Him. But it was after the temptation 
and the victory, as is plain from Matt iv. n. And for this reason, 
that Jesus might show in His own person that consolation and 
comfort and the ministry of angels has been prepared by God 
for those who overcome temptations. 

Ver. 14. And after that John was delivered up 9 Arc This was 
the second coming of Christ from Judsea into Galilee, that He 
might dee from Herod, lest he should cast Him also into prison. 
For Christ had been preaching and baptizing in Judsea. And 
the increase of His glory there had excited the envy of the Scribes 
and Pharisees, who denounced Him to Herod as though He 
were a revolutionist Wherefore this is the same coming of Christ 
as that mentioned in Matt iv. is, Luke iv. 14, and John 
iv. 3 and 43. Although some say that this last was a different 
one, and the third advent of Christ into Galilee, because Christ 
was then deeing from the Pharisees, as John says; but in His 
second coming He was deeing from Herod, as Matthew and 
Mark say. But, as I have observed, He ded from the Pharisees 
because He ded from Herod. For they had accused Him to 
Herod. Wherefore this was the same dight of Christ, and the 
same coming into Galilee. 

Ver. 15. And sayings Because (Gr. ht) the time 9 Arc. The time 9 
that is, of the advent of Messiah, and the kingdom of heaven. 
That, indeed, what had been shut for so many thousands of 
years, Christ by His preaching, His death, and His grace, might 
open and unclose.

committed, and determine to change your lives for the better. 
Beautifully says the Scholiast in S. Jerome, “The sweetness of 
the apple makes up for the bitterness of the root, the hope of 
gain makes pleasant the perils of the sea, the expectation of health 
mitigates the nauseousness of medicine. He who desires the 
kernel breaks the nut ; so he who desires the joy of a holy con- 
science swallows down the bitterness of penance.” 

Ver. 19. Janus the son of Zebedee and John. Again beautifully 
says the Scholiast, “By this chariot of the four fishermen we are 
carried up to heaven, as Elias was. On these four corner-stones 
the Church was first built By four virtues we are changed into 
the image of God, being obedient by prudence, acting manfully 
by justice, trampling on the serpent by temperance, and gaining 
the grace of God by fortitude.” Theophylact says, “ Peter y that is, 
action, is first called, afterwards John, that is, contemplation.” 

Ver. 23. And there was in their synagogue a man with an 
unclean spirit, i.e., a man having an unclean spirit, that is to 
say, possessed by a devil . The Greek has, in an unclean spirit , and 
it is a Hebraism. For the Hebrew uses 3 , beth, i.e., in , when 
one noun governs another in the genitive. 

And he cried out, Le., the spirit, by the mouth of the man 
possessed, “as though he were suffering torment,” says the 
Scholiast in S. Chrysostom, “as though in pain, as though not 
able to bear his strokes.” “For,” as Bede says, “the presence 
of the Saviour is the torment of the devils.” Christ desired that 
by this public testimony of the demon concerning Him, in the 
synagogue of Capernaum (for it is plain from ver. 21 that these 
things occurred there), the Jews who were gathered there might 
acknowledge Him to be Messias. There is nothing about this 
demoniac in Matthew, but there is in Luke iv. 33. 

Saying. The Gr. subjoins la, which the translator of Luke 
iv. 34 renders by let alone, as if the imperative of the verb ia«, 
Le., suffer, permit ; as Euthymius says, dismiss us. Others take la 
as an adverb of grieving, wondering, beseeching. As it were, “ Ah ! 
alas ! Lord, in what have I injured Thee?”

THE DEVILS KNOW CHRIST. 


371 


Ver. 24. What have we to do with Thee , , Jesus of Nazareth t 
Art Thou come to destroy usf I know who Thou art , the Holy 
One of God . “What is there between us and Thee, O Jesus? 
We have not attacked Thee, O Christ, who art holy ; but sinners, 
who are, as it were, our own. We have no contention with Thee ; 
do not Thou, then, contend with and destroy us.” 

Come to destroy us. Some MSS. add, before the time. But the 
words are not found in the Greek, Latin, Syriac, and Arabic 
received texts. They seem to have been transferred hither from 
S. Matt. ix. 25. With respect to the meaning, in the first place, 
Bede says that the demons, beholding the Lord upon earth, 
supposed that they were to be immediately judged. It was as 
though they said, “Do not Thou, O Jesus, by Thine advent 
bring on so quickly the day of judgment, and banish us to the 
bottomless pit without any hope of coming forth.” Second, the 
Scholiast in S. Chrysostom says, “Thou givest us no place among 
men when Thou teachest divine things.” But this is mystical. 
Third, and correctly, “Hast Thou come to destroy us, to cast 
us out from men, and send us to hell?” Whence Theophylact 
says, “ He calls going out of men his destruction.” For the highest 
pleasure of the devils is to possess and vex men. 

1 know , &c. Arab. O Holy One ; the Gr. i &yio;, emphati- 
cally, the Holy One. “Thou who art so holy that Thou com- 
municatest Thy holiness to others, since Thou art, as it were, 
the Fountain and the Sun of holiness, who sanctifiest all the 
saints, the Messiah and the Son of God, for whom all are 
eagerly waiting so many thousand years!” There is an allu- 
sion to Dan. ix. 24, “until the Holy of Holies, i.&, Messiah, be 
anointed.” 

1 know , i.e., / suspect , / think. For, as the Scholiast in 
Chrysostom says, the devil had no firm and certain knowledge 
of the coming of God. Because, as S. Austin says (lib. 9, de Civ. 
c. 21), He only made known to them as much as He wished; 
and He only wished as much as was expedient. 

Ver. 25. And Jesus threatened him: Gr. i.e., rebuked^

chided him with threats . That He would punish him unless he 
were silent 

Saying, Speak no more : Arab, shut thy mouth. Wherefore? I 
answer, First, Because it was not fitting that Christ should be 
commanded by the devil 

Second, That He might not appear to be a friend of the devil, 
and to hold intercourse with him. For afterwards it was objected 
to Christ that He cast out devils by the aid of Beelzebub. By 
acting as He did, Christ has taught us to shun all dealings with 
the devil ; for he is the sworn enemy of God, and is wholly bent 
upon injuring and destroying us, even when he promises or brings 
us any corporal aid. Wherefore, as the Scholiast in Chrysostom 
saith, “ Be silent ; let thy silence be My praise. Let not thy voice, 
but thy torments praise Me. I am not pleased that thou shouldst 
praise Me, but that thou shouldst go forth.” 

Third, To show that we should resist flattery, that it may not 
stir up any desire of vainglory in our breast 

Fourth, Euthymius says, “ He has taught us never to believe 
the demons, even when they say what is true. For since they 
love falsehood, and are most hostile to us, they never speak the 
truth except to deceive. They make use of the truth as it were 
a kind of bait” For, liars that they are, they conceal their lies by 
a colouring of truth. They say certain things that are true at the 
first, and afterwards interweave with them what is false, that those 
who have believed the first may believe also the last For this 
cause Paul drove out the spirit of Python, who praised him, 
Acts xvi. 18. 

Fifth, Because the demon in an unseasonable manner, and too 
speedily, disclosed that Christ was Messiah. For this might have 
injured Him, and turned the people away from Him. For so 
mighty a secret should be disclosed gradually, and the people be 
persuaded of its truth by many miracles ; for otherwise they would 
not at first receive it and believe it This was why (viii. 30) 
Christ forbids the Apostles also to say that He was Christ So 
Maldonatus and others.

THE DEVIL'S RAGE. 


373 


Symbolically: Bede, “The devil, because he had deceived Eve 
with his tongue, is punished by the tongue, that he might not speak.” 
Ver. 26. And the unclean spirit tearing him, &c. Tearing (Vulg. 
discerpens), not by lacerating or mutilating the man who was 
possessed by him, for Luke says (iv. 35) that he did no harm 
to him, but by contorting and twisting his limbs this way 
and that, as if he wished to tear him piecemeal. For the 
Greek eragdrru signifies to pull or tear in pieces. The devil did 
this through rage and madness, that being compelled by Christ 
to go out of the man, he might injure him as much as he could. 
But the nearer and the more powerful the grace of Christ is, 
the more impotently does the devil rage. For, observe, the devil 
only raised a dreadful tempest, but one that was vain and 
ineffectual For he cannot hurt when Christ forbids. Christ 
permitted it for three reasons. 1. That it might be plain that 
this man was really possessed by the deviL 2. That the malice 
and wrath of the demon might be made apparent 3. That it 
might be clear that the demon went forth, not of his own will, but 
because he was compelled to do so by Christ 

Tropologically : S. Gregory teaches (Horn. 12, in Ezek.) that 
the devil wonderfully tempts and vexes sinners when they are 
converted. “As soon,” he says, “as the mind begins to love 
heavenly things, as soon as it collects itself for the vision of inward 
peace with its whole intention, that ancient adversary, who fell 
from heaven, is envious, and begins to lie in wait more insidiously, 
and brings to bear sharper temptations than he was wont, so as, 
for the most part, to try the soul which resists in a way that he 
had never tried her when he possessed her. Wherefore it is 
written, My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, stand fast in 
justice and fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.” 

And crying out. With dreadful bowlings, shrieking, and roaring, 
to show how unwillingly he went out, and what great power was 
applied to him by Christ For he uttered no articulate speech. 
For Christ had forbidden him to speak when He said shut thy 
mouth. Thus Euthymius says, “Being scourged by the Lord's

commands, he cried out with a loud voice, and yet he spake not 
when he cried, because he uttered cries which signified nothing.” 
Titus adds, “ When the man was restored to himself, then he uttered 
the speech of a man.” 

Ver. 27. What new doctrine is this, &c. “ What is this heavenly 

and divine doctrine, which indeed God confirms from heaven by 
so many and such mighty miracles? For Christ, the Teacher of 
this doctrine, not by prayers, but of His mere power, and by His 
command only, orders the devils to go out, and they obey Him . 
Wherefore this must, be the Messias, the Son of God, and the true 
God ; for He alone commands the devils by His power.” 

Ver. 32. When the sun had set: Gr. $n tdu i i\io ( 9 i,e , 9 when 
the sun was swallowed up and sunk in the sea. For dvofLou means 
to be sunk , submerged , and is spoken of islands which are submerged 
and drowned by the sea. This is a form of speech adopted from 
the common people, who think that when the sun sets it is sub- 
merged in the oceaa 

Ver. 33. And all the city (Capernaum, as appears from ver. 21) 
was gathered together at the door. Of the house of Peter and

Ver. 34. And He healed many 9 i.e , 9 all who presented themselves, 
for they were many.

because they knew that He Himself was He,

first commencement of dawn, whilst it was yet dark. Thus it 
might be called night by S. Mark, although by S. Luke (iv. 42) 
it is called day 9 because the day was just about beginning to 
dawn. 

He went into a desert place 9 that He might pray thus more 
quietly and attentively. Wherefore it follows, and there prayed^ 
both that after so many miracles He might avoid the praise and 
applause of men, and to teach us to do the same. Learn here 
from Christ to give the early morning to prayer, and to rise up

with the dawn, so as to have leisure for meditation, and to give 
the first-fruits of the day to God. For the dawn of day is a friend 
of the Muses, but a greater friend of God and the angels. 

Ver. 43. And He strictly charged him. The Gr. is, And having 
threatened him, he straightway sent him out. He severely com- 
manded him with threats to conceal the miracle of healing which 
He had just wrought ; and therefore He dismissed him, and sent 
him away from Him, that it might not be known that He had 
cured him of his leprosy ; and that this might afford us an example 
of avoiding the applause of men. 

Ver. 44. Show thyself to the high priest (Vulg.). Gr. to the priest 
For not only the High Priest, but any priest might judge concerning 
leprosy, whether it was healed or no, as is plain from Lev. xiii. a. 
It is probable, however, that because the case of leprosy was so 
grave and difficult, the decision concerning it was, by the inter- 
pretation and decree of the pontiffs, reserved for a Chief Priest, 
as is here said, that is, for one of the twenty-four heads of the 
priests, who each in turn presided for a week over the rest of the 
priests, and the sacrifices, and the other offices and rites of the 
Temple, according to the institution of David, as appears from 
1 Chron. xxiv. 3, &c. 

Ver. 45. But he, being gone out, began to publish and to blase 
abroad the word, i.e., the fact of the miracle of his leprosy having 
been healed by Christ. For he thought that this was for the 
glory of God and Christ, although Christ, out of humility and 
modesty, had enjoined silence; but he himself did not consider 
this command binding upon him. 

So that he could not openly go into the city, without feeling His 
modesty hurt by the honour and applause of the people. Or 
could not may mean would not For so could is often put for 
would, as Nazianzen shows by many examples (Or at. 4, de 
Theolog.).

A few MSS. read, after eight days . 

Ver. 2. And many came together, so that there was no room , &G. 
See what is said in the Introduction to this Gospel. 

Ver. 5. Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Hear Bede, ,f When He 
is about to heal, He first forgives the man his sins, to show that 
he was suffering for his faults.” For men are afflicted with bodily 
ills, either for the increase of merit, as Job and the martyrs; or 
for the preservation of humility, as Paul ; or for the correction of 
sin, as the sister of Moses, and this paralytic; or for the glory 
of God, as the man who was born blind ; or for a beginning of 
damnation, as Herod. 

Bede adds that this paralytic was carried by four bearers, to 
signify that a man in the faith of his soul is lifted up by four 
virtues to deserve soundness, namely, by prudence, fortitude, justice, 
and temperance. 

Ver. 14. He saw Levi (the son) of Alphaus, i.e., He saw Matthew, 
who by another name is called Levi before he was called by 
Christ, for after his vocation he is always called Matthew. Of

(Matt. x. 3). Luke and Mark call Matthew Levi, out of regard 
for his good name, because this name of Levi was known but to 
few. But he calls himself Matthew, to humiliate himself and to 
profess openly that he was a sinner and a publican.

of others. He left also the accounts of his taxes imperfect, and 
not cast up, because the Lord had so inflamed him that he 
straightway followed Him who called him.” 

Ver. 26. Under Abiathar. You will say that it is said in 
1 Sam. xxL 6 that this was done under Ahimelecb, the father of 
Abiathar. I answer, first, that Abiathar was even then the pontiff 
together with his father, because when his father was absent, or 
sick, or otherwise engaged, he discharged the High Priest’s office ; 
and he was shortly to succeed his father, at his death, in the 
pontificate. Listen to Bede : That the Lord calls Abiathar the 
High Priest instead of Ahimelech involves no discrepancy, for 
both were on the spot when David came and asked for and 
received the loaves. And when Ahimelech was slain by Saul, 
Abiathar fled to David, and was his companion through the whole 
of his exile. Afterwards, when David was king, he received the 
rank of the high-priesthood; and continuing in the pontificate 
during the whole of David’s reign, he became much more cele- 
brated than his father, and so was more worthy to be called 
High Priest by the Lord, even during his father’s lifetime. 

Second, and better, It is clear from Scripture that both father 
and son bore both names, and were called sometimes Abiathar, 
sometimes Ahimelech. This appears from 2 Sam. viii. 17, 1 
Chron. xviii. 16 and xxiv. 6. So Jansen, Toletus, &c. 

The Sabbath was made (Syr. created) for man, &c That is, the 
Sabbath was instituted for the benefit of man, that man, by the 
rest of the Sabbath, should refresh and restore his body, fatigued 
by the continuous labour of six days of the week; and that he 
should apply his mind to the things which concern his eternal 
salvation^ such as hearing and meditating upon the law of God.

The force of the argument is this : Since the Sabbath was insti- 
tuted for the .sake of man, and not man for the sake of the 
Sabbath, therefore, if the Sabbatical rest be hurtful to man, it must 
be abandoned, and the labour undertaken that man may be bene- 
fited. Therefore rightly do I permit My disciples to engage in the 
moderate labour of plucking the ears of com on the Sabbath, 
to satisfy their hunger. For it is better that the rest of the 
Sabbath should be broken than that men should perish. 

Therefore the Son of Man , &c. Some understand the therefore 
in this place as properly inferential from what has gone before, 
thus : Since the Sabbath was made for man, and the Son of Man, 
that is, Christ, is Lord of all men, and of all things which pertain 
to man’s health, therefore He is Lord also of the Sabbath, so as 
to be able to dispense from it But it is better and simpler to 
take the therefore not as inferential \ but as complementary for 
lastly, in short. Wherefore the Arabic so translates, and makes 
the passage of the following effect: “Lastly, the Son of Man, 
that is, I, Christ, because I am the Messias and God, am 
Lord of the Sabbath, I who instituted it at the beginning for 
man’s benefit, and therefore am able for the benefit of man to 
order, to relax, or to abolish it This is the fresh and final reason 
by which Christ proves to the Scribes that it was lawful to pluck 
the ears of com on the Sabbath to satisfy hunger.” 

Mystically: Says Theophylact, Christ healing on the Sabbath 
signifies that those who have rest in their passions are able to 
heal sinners agitated by their passions, and lead them to virtue. 
More fully Bede. The disciples, he says, are teachers. The com 
means those planted in the faith, whom the teachers visit, and 
hungering for their salvation, pluck away from earthly things. And 
by their hands , i.e., by their examples, they bring them away from 
the lust of the flesh, as it were out of husks. They eat them, 
that is, they incorporate them as members into the Church. And 
they do it upon the Sabbath, because this is for the hope of 
future rest

THE SABBATH. 


3/9 


CHAPTER III. 

I Christ healeth thewithtred hand io and many other infirmities : 1 1 rehuketh 
the unclean spirits: 13 choose th his twelve apostles: 22 convinceth the 
blasphemy of casting out devils by Beelzebub .*31 and sheweth who are his 
brother , sister, and mother . 

Ver. 4. And He saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the 
Sabbath-days , or to do evill to save life, or to destroy f But they 
held their peace. The translator reads &*o >i<ra/, that is, to destroy . 
We now read avoKrtlmt, i.e, to kill But to destroy is better. 
For the Gospel is speaking of a maimed person, who had a 
withered hand, not of one who was dead. With reference to 
healing this maimed person, the Scribes had proposed a doubt 
or scruple, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-days f Christ 
resolved this doubt by means of another question, not dubious, 
but plain, Is it lawful to do well on the Sabbath , or to do evil ; 
to save a soul , or to destroy it t (Vulg.). A soul \ i.e., a man, says 
S. Augustine. The meaning is, if any one should not succour 
or do a kindness to one who is sick or heavily afflicted, like this 
maimed man, on the Sabbath, when he is able to do it, as I, 
Christ, am able, he does him an injury; for he refuses him the 
help which is due to him by the law of love. In a similar sense 
S. Augustine says, “If thou hast not fed the hungry, thou hast 
killed him,” because thou hast allowed him to die of hunger. 
In like manner, if thou hast not delivered him who was about 
to be killed by a robber, when thou mightest have done so, thou 
hast slain him; for his death will be reckoned to thee by God

S. MARK, C. IIL 


for guilt and punishment, in exactly the same manner as if thou 
hadst killed him thyself. Christ, therefore, signifies that not to 
do good on the Sabbath to a sick person, when thou art able, 
is to do him evil. But it is never lawful to do evil. Therefore 
it is always lawful to do good to such persons, even on the 
Sabbath. For the Sabbath is devoted to God and good works. 
And thus it is a more grievous sin to do evil on the Sabbath 
than upon other days. For by this means the sanctity of the 
Sabbath is violated, even as by doing good upon it it is the 
better kept and hallowed. 

Ver. 5. And looking round upon them with anger. Being angry 
at their unbelief, says the Interlinear , showing by His countenance 
that He was wroth with the blind, and obstinate, and perverse 
minds of the Scribes, in that they ascribed Christ’s miracles of 
goodness, which He wrought upon the Sabbath, to a breach of 
the law enjoining the observance of that day. From hence it is 
plain that there was in Christ real anger, sorrow, and the rest 
of the passions and affections, as they exist in other men, only 
subject to reasoa Wherefore anger was in Him a whetstone of 
virtue. “Anger,” says Franc. Lucas, “is in us a passion; in 
Christ it was, as it were, an action. It arises spontaneously in us ; 
by Christ it was stirred up in Himself. When it has arisen in 
us, it disturbs the other faculties of the body and mind, nor 
can it be repressed at our own pleasure; but when stirred up in 
Christ, it acts as He wills it to act, it disturbs nothing, — in fine, 
it ceases when He wills it to cease.” 

This is what S. Leo (Epist. 11) says, “The bodily senses were 
vigorous in Christ without the law of sin ; and the reality of His 
affections was governed by His soul and deity.” 

Lactantius says (lih. de Ira Dei ex Posidon .), “Anger is the 
lust of punishing him by whom you think yourself to have been 
injured.” Wherefore anger in other men springs from self-love; 
but in Christ it sprang from love of God, because He loved God 
perfectly. Hence He was infinitely grieved and angry at offences 
against God by reason of sin, and committed by sinners, wishing

to compensate for those offences by punishing or correcting sinners 
and unbelievers. Wherefore Christ’s anger was zeal, or seasoned 
with zeal, even as in the angels and the blessed it is not anger 
but zeal (See S. Thomas, 3 p. q. art 9.) 

Being grieved at the blindness , Syriac, hardness or callousness , 
of their hearts. Grieved^ Gr. tfuXXvwou/afwf, Le., condoling with 
and commiserating them, because, being blinded and hardened by 
envy and hatred, they would not acknowledge Him to be the 
Messiah, but spake evil of His kindness to the sick upon the 
Sabbath-days. It is meant, therefore, that the anger of Jesus 
did not proceed from the desire of vengeance, but was mingled 
with pity ; and that Jesus was angry with sin, but sorry for sinners, 
insomuch as He loved them, and strove to save them. Lastly, 
all such anger is mingled with sorrow ; for he that is angry grieves 
for the evil at which he is angry. Thus the sorrow for the evil 
causes and sharpens anger, that it may strive to remove the evil 
at which it is grieved. 

Ver. 9. That a little ship should wait upon Him. Gr. «yx>*- 
xapnpf, i.e., should be close at hand, that He might betake 
Himself to it when the multitude pressed upon Him.

fell down, kneeling at His feet, not out of love and devotion, but 
from fear, deprecating punishment, that He would not drive them 
out of the men, and banish them to helL 

Sayings Thou art the Son of God. You will ask whether the 
devils really knew that Jesus was the Messiah or the Christ, the 
Son of God? I answer, it is plain from this passage, and from 
S. Matthew viii. 29, and from S. Luke iv. 41, and from the 
Fathers and commentators generally, that the devils, although 
they did not frilly know Christ at His baptism, and before His 
baptism, because they afterwards tempted Him, that they might 
learn who He was; yet subsequently they did recognise who He

S. MARK, c. III. 


was, from the many and great miracles, which they clearly saw 
were true miracles, and far transcending their own power and 
that of the angels. They saw that what Christ did was wrought 
by the alone power of God, with this end in view, that He 
might prove, first, that He was the Messiah promised to the 
fathers ; second, that He was God, and the Son of God. Where- 
fore, I say that the devils knew that Jesus was the Messiah and 
the Son of God, especially when they compared the Scriptures 
and the ancient prophecies with the miracles of Christ For they 
saw that Jesus was to be such a person, and would work such 
miracles, as they had predicted 

Observe, however, that the devils did not so clearly know this 
truth, as not, on the other hand, when they thought of the great- 
ness of the mystery, and of the infinite dignity and humiliation 
of Christ incarnate (which would appear a thing of itself incredible, 
especially to the devil, being most proud), somewhat to hesitate 
and be in doubt whether Jesus were really Messiah and the Son 
of God. They the more hesitated, yea, they were ignorant of the 
object and fruit of this mystery, that indeed by the incarnation 
and death of Christ men were to be redeemed, and that the 
kingdom of God was to be erected in them. Especially were 
they blinded by their hatred of Jesus, because they saw that many 
souls were delivered from them by Him. Hence they felt that 
He must be altogether opposed and crushed by them. Whence 
it came to pass that they, being blinded by their hatred of Jesus, 
did not understand the Holy Scriptures, otherwise so plain, con- 
cerning the cross of Christ and our redemption thereby. Thus, 
by means of the Jews, they crucified and slew Jesus as an irre- 
concilable enemy; and thus they ignorantly destroyed their own 
kingdom. Thus S. Leo (, Serm . 9, de Pass.), “Nor did the devil 
himself perceive that by his rage against Christ he destroyed his 
own principality; who would not have lost the rights he had 
gained by his ancient fraud if he had refrained from shedding 
the blood of the Lord Jesus. But by his malice, being greedy of 
doing harm, when he rushes upon Him, he falls ; when he would

capture, he is taken; whilst he pursues a mortal, he stumbles 
against the Saviour.” 

And Simon He sumamed Peter. Several Greek codices prefix to 
these words, rpurov first Peter. The rest omit them. The 
same thing is sufficiently gathered from the fact that Peter is here 
first named by Christ, and his name changed, so that he who was 
first called Simon , is afterwards called in Syriac Cephas , in Greek 
and Latin Petrus, that is, a rock , because he was to be made 
by Christ the rock and foundation of the Church. 

And Janies the son of Zebedee (James is named first because he 
was the elder), and John the brother of James. And he called 
them Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder. He saith not name, 
but names, because they were two. They were thunderers, thun- 
dering forth, as it were, Christ’s Gospel and doctrines. 

Boanerges: so the Arabic, Egyptian, and Persian. The Ethiopic 
has Boanerges. This name is a corruption, for in Hebrew, or 
rather in Syriac, it would be Banerges or Bonerges, as it is found 
in certain MSS., as Franc. Lucas attests in his Notation. For the 
Syrians, like the Bavarians and the Westphalians, pronounce the 
vowel a like 0, and e like a. For Semuel they say Samuel \ and for 
bene, or sons, bane. It may be that Banerges has been changed 
into Boanerges by persons ignorantly supposing that boa signifies 
the sound of thunder. 

Banerges, as Jansen observes, is a compound word, consisting 
of ' 23 , bane, sons , and IPJJ, regesch, a roaring, i.e., of thunder. 
Thus Jupiter is called by the Greeks loftily roaring, 

ie., thundering on high. The Syriac version has in this place bane 
reges, sons of thunder, instead of the Hebrew expression, bene roam. 
For Christ here spake in the Syriac of that age. There is here, 
then, a metathesis or transposition of the letters r and e, banerges, 
instead of bane reges. A similar transposition is common in many 
languages, as Angelus Caninius shows {Hellen. p. 64). Thus, for 
xapd/a the Greek poets say xpadlri, xparep 6 g for xaprcpos ; for 
Kvpov the Latins say nervus ; for < 2 /wra£, rapax ; for p*p<t>i, 
forma. Punic has gerac for &k pa, i.e., arx, a citadel. Etruscan

has bigr, virgo, a virgin ; darag, gradus , a step ; elmara . mutter, a 
woman ; cabbirim, cherubim, &c 

The meaning, then, is as follows : Christ called James and John 
by a new name, Banerges , Sons of thunder , because He charged 
them above the rest of the Apostles with the glorious preaching 
of His Gospel, that by the holiness of their lives and their miracles 
they might be like thunderbolts, and might, by the power of their 
voices, shake as with claps of thunder unbelievers and barbarians, 
and bring them to repentance and a holy life. This appears in 
the history of S. James. Because of his liberty and zeal in 
preaching, he was the first among the Apostles to incur the wrath 
of Herod and the Jews, by whom he was beheaded (Acts xiL). 
The same converted the Spaniards, and by their means the 
inhabitants of the East and West Indies, to the faith of Christ 
John preached for a very long period, and very efficaciously. He 
was the last of the Apostles to depart this life, which he did 
after he had subdued Asia and other provinces to Christ by his 
preaching. Hence, also, his Gospel begins with divine thunder, 
as it were an eagle of God crying with a voice of thunder, 
In the beginning was the Word, \ and the Word was with God, and 
the Word was God (S. Epiphanius, Hares. 73). Wherefore, when he 
was writing his Gospel, there were lightnings and thunderings from 
heaven, like as it lightned from Mount Sinai when God gave the 
law to Moses. So Baronius shows from Metaphrastes (a.d. 99 in fine). 

See what I have said on Ezek. i. 14, on the words, “They went like 
a flash of lightning,” where I have given a threefold meaning to the 
expression, Sons of thunder. Thus Pericles, as an orator, seemed, says 
Quintilian, not so much to speak as to thunder and lighten. Where- 
fore he was called by the poets the Olympian, that is, the heavenly. 

Ver. 21. He is beside himself See what has been said on S. 
Matt. xii. 46. The Arabic has, saying that He is foolish. The 
Greek is igitfnj, ie., He has gone out of His mind, through too 
great piety and zeal. The Syriac renders literally. Others render 
differently, saying that He has swooned, from hunger, because, on 
account of the multitude, He had no leisure to eat.

THE GOSPEL NOT TO BE HID. 


385 


CHAPTER IV. 

I The parable of the sower ; 14 and the meaning thereof. 21 IVe must com - 
municate the light of our knowledge to others. 26 The parable of the seed 
growing secretly , 30 and of the mustard seed. 35 Christ stilleth the 
tempest on the sea. 

Ver. 10. And when He was alone : Gr. xa ra/itmg, Vulg. singu- 
laris, solitary, by Himself. 

The twelve that were with Him asked Him. The Greek, Syriac, 
and Arabic have with the twelve, meaning that the seventy dis- 
ciples, who, with the twelve Apostles, were followers of Jesus, asked 
Him what was the meaning of the parable of the Sower. 

Ver. 21. Doth a candle come in, i.e., is it brought into a house, 
to be put under a bushel or under a bed f That it should be hidden 
under a vessel ? No ! but that it should be exposed publicly, and 
give light to all. Christ signified by this parable that it was not 
His will that the mysteries of this parable and the other doctrines 
of the Gospel should be concealed and hidden, but that His 
disciples should unfold them in their time, and communicate to 
others who at that time were not able to receive them. It was 
His will that they should publish and preach them openly. This 
is plain from what follows. 

Ver. 22. For there is nothing hid which shall not be made mani- 
fest ; neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad. 
This is the Greek and Latin reading. Although the doctrine of 
the Gospel and My deeds and words are as yet hidden and 

secret, I do not wish them always to remain so. At the proper

time they must be openly proclaimed by you, O My disciples. 
So SS. Jerome and Bede. This is what Christ says in S. Matt 
x. 27, What 1 say unto you in darkness , that speak ye in light , &c. 

Ver. 24. And He said unto them , Take heed what ye hear . 
The meaning, says Euthymius, is, “ Attend to the things which ye 
hear of Me, that ye may understand them, and commit them to 
memory, that when the proper time shall arrive ye may com- 
municate them to others.” And He assigns the reason, which, as 
Theophylact says, is, “ That none of My words may escape you.” 
Hear Bede, “ He teaches us carefully to hear His words, in such 
manner that we should carefully digest them in our hearts, and be 
able to bring them forth for the hearing of others.” 

In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you 
again, and more shall be given to you. He means, if ye largely 
and copiously communicate and preach My doctrine to others, I 
also will copiously impart to you more understanding and greater 
wisdom, grace, and glory, as a recompense and reward to you. 
Thus fountains, the more they pour out above, the more they 
receive from below. Therefore, let preachers, teachers, and cate- 
chists learn from this promise of Christ, that the more pains 
they bestow in teaching others, the more grace and wisdom they 
will receive from Christ themselves, according to the words, “ He 
that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth 
in blessings,” #.*., abundantly, “ shall reap also in blessings ” (2 Cor. 
ix. 6), Vulg. 

Ver. 25. For he that hath, to him shall be given ; and he that 
hath not , that also which he hath shall be taken away from him . 
Hath, that is, uses, and shows that he hath by using. For such 
a one hath indeed, but he who useth not a gift or grace hath it 
but in name. This is what theologians say, that he who uses his 
grace hath it in a second act ; but he who uses it not hath it only 
in the first act, that is, in power and possession. The meaning 
therefore is, he who, by study or by imparting to others, uses 
learning given him by God, an increase of learning shall be given ; 
but from him who uses not his learning, shall God take it away.

THE SPIRITUAL HUSBANDRY. 


387 


Ver. 26. And He said ', So is the kingdom of God \ as if a man 
should cast seed into the earth . This is another parable, different 
from that of the Sower , which precedes it Both, however, are 
taken from seed, but differently applied and explained. Moreover, 
by the seed \ as SS. Chrysostom and Bede rightly explain, both here 
and in S. Matt, xiii., is signified evangelical doctrine . By the 
field, hearers ; by the harvest, the end of the world, or each one’s 
death, is meant. 

Ver. 27. And should sleep, that is to say, the sower, and rise, 
night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up whilst 
he knoweth not Some refer the words rise night and day to 
the seed; meaning that the seed should germinate, it knoweth 
not how, that is, like a man sleeping. More obviously, S. 
Chrysostom, Theophylact, Maldonatus, and others refer the 
words to the sower, so that night pertains to the word sleep, 
day to the word rise . The meaning is, As the husbandman 

who has sowed is sleeping idly in the night, and is employed 
in various occupations during the day, and thinks not about the 
seed, that seed is germinating by its own innate force, and is 
growing up whilst the husbandman knoweth it not. So also it 
puts forth first the blade, then the ear, and then the full com in 
the ear . So, too, in the same manner is the doctrine and preach- 
ing of the Gospel They were sown by Christ and His Apostles, 
that is, they were preached from small beginnings. But by degrees 
they grew insensibly into the mature and mighty harvests of the 
faithful, whilst Christ was, as it were, sleeping in heaven, and per- 
mitting the Jews and unbelieving nations and tyrants to rise up 
against His Apostles, and persecute and kill them. It increases, I 
say, and propagates itself gradually, until it fills the world, when, 
the harvest being ripe, the com, i.e., the elect, shall be gathered 
into the granary of heaven. 

By this parable, then, is signified the power of the Gospel, which 
by degrees has pervaded the whole world, and is converting it to 
Christ. Tacitly, also, it is signified that preachers of the Gospel 
must not glory in their preaching, as though they by it w$re convert-

ing the world. For, as the Apostle saith, “ Neither he that planteth 
is anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase 
(i Cor. iii. 7). Christ further intimates that preachers ought not 
to be downcast if they see small and tardy fruits of their preaching, 
because God will, by the few converted by them, gradually con- 
vert many more. So S. James, by means of seven, or, as some 
say, by nine, whom he converted in Spain, converted the whole 
country. 

Ver. 28. For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit ; first the 
blade , then the ear, afterwards the full com in the ear Arabic, 
Because the earth alone bringeth forth fruit ; . . . afterwards the ear 
is filled , and when the fruit is perfect , then the sickle is applied, 
because it is harvest Thus, in like manner, by the preaching of 
the Gospel, the faith of Christ and His Church grew by various 
degrees of increase. 

Moraliter: Expositors adapt these three expressions, blade, 
ear , full com, to a threefold increment of virtues and merits. 
For the earth of our heart germinates, first, the blade, when it 
conceives good desires; secondly, the ear, when it proceeds to 
earnest working; thirdly, the grain, when it brings the works of 
virtue to full maturity and perfection. Theophylact says, “ The 
blade is the beginning of good ; the ear is when we resist temp- 
tations ; the fruit is perfect work.” 

Hear S. Gregory (Horn. 15, in Ezek.), “To produce the blade 
is to hold the first tender beginning of good. The blade arrives 
at perfection when virtue conceived in the mind leads to ad- 
vancement in good works. The full com fructifies in the ear when 
virtue makes such great progress that it has its perfect work.” 

Christ here intimates that the Apostles, and those who work 
for the conversion of souls, ought with long-suffering to await 
the fruit of their labours, as husbandmen do. They ought to 
cherish those who are tender in the faith, and gradually lead 
them on to the height of virtue by teaching, admonishing, and 
exercising them. Let no one, therefore, says Bede, who is 
beheld to be of good purpose in the tenderness of his mind, be

despised, because the fruit takes its rise from the blade, and 
becomes corn. 

Symbolically: The Scholiast says the blade was in the law of 
nature, the ear in the law of Moses, the fruit in the Gospel 

Ver. 29. And when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he 
putteth in the sickle . Greek , trap it wapadw 6 k apwfc, that is, 
when indeed the fruit has brought itself forth ; for fruit is here in 
the nominative case. The Syriac has, when it has become fat ; 
Arabic, when it is perfect. This is a Hebraism, for in Hebrew 
verbs in the conjugation Hitpacl have a passive, or reflex, 
signification, by which the agent receives the action in himself, 
so that the agent is the same as the recipient of the action. 
Wherefore some codices read, when the fruit has produced itself. 
Otherwise Maldonatus explains, “ When the fruit, that is, the seed 
itself, which was the fruit of former seed, shall have brought 
forth, that is to say, other seed from itself.” 

Ver. 33. And with many such parables He spake the word 
unto them, as they were able to hear it, that is, as they were 
worthy to hear, as Maldonatus says, from Bede and Euthymius. 
More simply and plainly, Theophylact and Franc. Lucas explain 
with such, i.e., common and easy parables, which all could under- 
stand, not with what was abstruse; so that they might take in 
their literal drift, and perceive that there was something heavenly 
and divine lying beneath the surface, although they did not 
comprehend each particular. Thus, by what was known of the 
parable they were stirred up by Christ to investigate what lay 
hid. 

Ver. 36. As He was in the ship. The disciples took up 
Christ upon the deep sea, that they might cross over it with 
Him; Christ, I say, as He was in the ship, namely, sitting and 
teaching the people standing on the shore. This is plain from 
ver. 1, for afterwards it appears that He changed His position, 
sleeping in the ship. It marks the ready obedience of the 
disciples, and in turn Christ’s facile accommodation of Himself 
to their promptitude, that He might escape the tumult of the

counsel of God that the many persons who were carried in

by the authority of the Divine name, and as far as I can, I 
constrain Thee, that Thou wilt not cast me out of this body, 
and banish me to hell." For this was the greatest torment to a 
demon. 

Ver. 9. My name is Legion; Syriac, our name, & c., adding, by 
way of explanation, for we are many . A legion contained pro- 
perly 6666 soldiers. See what is said in Matt xxvi. 53. In 
this place a certain number is put for an uncertain. Observe, 
the devil is God’s ape. Hence he imitates God, who is “the 
Lord of hosts," that is, of angels. In a like way the devil calls 
himself legion, because he leads out many companions into line of 
battle to fight against God and His faithful people. Wherefore 
men have a right to dread that battle, knowing that their war- 
fare is not with men, but devils, and those many in number, who 
conspire for their destruction. Therefore they ought to implore the 
help of God and the holy angels, as Elisha did (2 Kings vi. 17). 

Ver. 25. And a woman which had an issue of blood, &c. This

woman was of Caesarea Philippi, which was formerly called Dan, 
and afterwards Paneas. This is the celebrated woman who, 
being healed by Christ of her issue of blood, erected in memory 
of so great a benefit that statue to Christ at Caesarea Philippi 
from whose base grew an herb which cured all diseases (Eus. ff. 
E. vil 14). Julian the Apostate threw the statue down, and set up 
one of himself in its place. But this was shivered to pieces by 
lightning, as S. Jerome testifies, and the Tripartite History (/. vL 
c. 19). Our innovators, who cast away, burn the relics of the 
saints, whilst they preserve and venerate the relics of their own 
leaders, act like Julian the Apostate. For the Zuinglians, or 
followers of Zuinglius, preserve with great devotion his heart, 
which was found among the ashes when he was burnt. So says 
Capito in his Life of Zuinglius.* 

It is not probable that this woman who had the issue of 
blood was Martha, the sister of Mary Magdalene, as S. Ambrose 
thinks (lib. de Salom. c. v.). For Martha lived at Bethany, near 
Jerusalem, not at Caesarea. The Gospel of Nicodemus says that 
her name was Veronica, the same who gave Christ a handker- 
chief to wipe the sweat when He was going to be crucified, and 
on which He left an impression of His face. 

Ver. 28. For she said \ If I shall touch but His garment, I shall be 
whole . Matthew (ix. 20), instead of garment , has the hem of His 
garment. This hem was a fringe of threads attached to the 
bottom of the robe, of a hyacinth or violet colour, which God 
commanded the Jews to wear, that it might put them continually 
in mind of God’s precepts and of heaven itself. This Christ wore, 
according to the law, as a mark that He belonged to the Jewish 
race and religion. 

There is here an example and proof of the use and efficacy 
of holy relics. For of such a nature was the hem or fringe of 
Christ which healed her that had the issue of blood. Calvin

replies that the woman was superstitious, and that a certain 
amount of superstition was mingled with what she did. But 
Christ and Mark refute this; for they ascribe her healing 
not to superstition, but to her faith, and commend her for it 
For in the 30th verse it is said, And Jesus , immediately knowing 
in Himself that virtue was gone out from Him (de illo), i.e., from 
(de) His fringe. And 34, Daughter , thy faith hath saved thee , go 
in peace. Rightly says S. Hilary, “Like as the Author of nature 
has given to a magnet the power of attracting iron, so did 
Christ give to His garment the power of healing her who touched 
in faith.” And if it were so with a garment, how much more 
with the Eucharist? Hence S. Gorgonia was healed of a severe 
disease by touching the Eucharist (See Nazianzen, Oral. 11.) 
So, too, was S. Catherine of Sienna, and many others. (See 
Salmeron, tom. 6, tract. 15.) 

Tropologically : The issue of blood, says Bede, is fleshly delight, 
as gluttony, luxury. The most pure flesh of Christ heals these 
when piously received in the Eucharist 

Ver. 30. And Jesus . . . had gone out of Him , and had healed 
her ; not as if any quality had gone out from Christ’s hem, or as if 
this virtue had gone from place to place, from the hem into the 
woman who had the issue of blood, but by reason of the effect 
which it produced in the woman. For the virtue abiding in Christ 
wrought the effect of healing in the woman. Like as, saith Theo- 
phylact, the learning of doctors is said to be communicated to 
their disciples, when, nevertheless, the learning itself remains in the 
doctors, and produces its effect only, that is, a like knowledge in 
the disciples. 

Observe, this virtue of healing and working miracles conferred 
by the Word upon the humanity of Christ, was not a physical 
quality. For that would have been infinite, as having divine and 
infinite efficacy, of which the humanity of Christ was not capable, 
being created. But it was a moral quality, that is to say, an 
instrumental virtue. For the humanity of Christ did these things 
as an instrument of the divinity.

S. MARK, C. V. 


Who hath touched My garments f Christ asks this question, 
says Bede, that the healing which He had given to the woman, 
being declared and made known, might advance in many the 
virtue of faith, and draw them to believe in Christ. 

Ver. 33. But the woman fearing and tremblings knowing what was 
done in her , came and fell down before Hints and told Him all the 
truth . Fearing and tremblings not because she had been guilty of 
an act of superstition, as Calvin would have it, but because she had 
approached secretly, and, unclean, had touched Christ the clean, 
and had, as it were, stolen a gift of healing from Christ without 
His knowledge. Therefore she was afraid lest Christ should rebuke 
her, or lest He should recall the benefit, or afflict her with a worse 
evil. Hence it is plain that she had not perfect faith and hope in 
Christ, or she would not have thought that she could be hid from 
Him, nor would she have been afraid of Him. Wherefore Christ 
said, to reassure her, Daughters be of good courages as Matthew says. 
Ver. 34. But He said to her , Daughters thy faith hath made thee 
whole . Christ here confirms the healing which had been con- 

ferred upon this trembling woman. It was as though He said to 
her, “Not My mere fringe, which with great faith of obtaining 
healing thou hast touched, hath saved thee, but chiefly My omni- 
potence, but secondarily thine own faith. For this, either as a 
disposition or a meritorious cause, has delivered thee from the 
issue of blood, which deliverance I ratify and confirm.” 

Go in peace . For God dwells in peace, that she may know that 
she is cleansed from her sins. For whom Christ healed in body, 
He likewise sanctified in soul. 

Ver. 39. The damsel is not dead , but sleepeth. For although she 
is really dead, yet she shall be forthwith awakened by Me from 
death as from sleep. Or, as the Scholiast in S. Jerome says, “To 
you she is dead, to Me she sleepeth.” 

Talitha cumi. In Hebrew a boy is called ieled, for which the 
Syrians and Chaldeans say tali, from whence comes the feminine 
talithas that is, girl Cumi means arises that she being dead should 
arise from the bed. Moreover, that Mark might give greater

emphasis, and express the sense of one who called and com- 
manded, he added, I say unto thee, as S. Jerome says. 

Ver. 42. And immediately the damsel rose up and walked, \ that she 
might show she was alive. Mystically , as Bede says, “The soul, 
when raised from sin, ought not only to arise from the filth of its 
wickedness, but should advance in good works.” 

Ver. 43. And commanded that something should be given her to eat, 
that He might show that she not only had arisen, but was in good 
health and hungry. For boys and girls are wont, when they 
awake out of sleep, if they are well and strong, to ask for food. 
And death was to her in the place of sleep, as Christ says in the 
39th verse.

Ver. 1. Going out from thence , i.e., from Capernaum, where He 
raised Jairus* daughter. 

He went into His own country , ie. f to Nazareth, where He was 
brought up. 

Ver. 2. They were in admiration at His doctrine : literally, they 
admired in His doctrine. This is a Hebraism. For the Hebrews 
use H as a preposition of contact either corporal or mental in the 
place of an accusative Thus they say, I touch in the hand , instead 
of, I touch the hand ; I believe in God, instead o f, I believe God ; 
/ admire in wisdom, for I admire wisdom . 

Ver. 5. And He could not do any miracles there. Could not, i.e., 
would not, because He did not think it proper to give what was 
holy to dogs, that is, to force His miracles upon unbelieving and 
^ ungrateful citizens. So could not is used for would not (Gen. xxxviL 
4, and John viL 7). “ Because,” says Victor of Antioch on this 

passage, “two things must coincide for the attaining of health, 
namely, the faith of those who need healing, and the power of 
him who will heal; therefore, if either of these be wanting, the 
blessing of a cure will not readily be attained.”

conflict with what is said in Luke iv. 23, And all ban Him 
record , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of 
His mouth. I answer, that the inhabitants of Nazareth wondered, 
indeed, that Jesus, the son of a carpenter, their well-known neigh- 
bour, should be so wise and eloquent, and yet were incredulous 
with respect to His doctrine and person, that He was in very deed 
the Messias or Christ And that this was so is plain from what 
Luke subjoins. 

Ver. 13. They anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed 
them. Some are of opinion that this anointing was the same as 
that of which S. James speaks in his Epistle (v. 14), that is to say 9 
the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. So Bede, Theophylact, Lyra, 
and others, who think that the Sacrament of Extreme Unction was 
at this time instituted by Christ, and that the Apostles by His 
command conferred it upon the sick, although they had not as yet 
been ordained priests. 

But the contrary seems more probable: 1. Because the priest 
alone is the minister of this sacrament ; but the Apostles were not 
yet priests, for Christ created them priests afterwards. 

2. Because the Apostles here anointed all sorts of sick persons, 
those not baptized, and those not about to die. But Extreme 
Unction is conferred only upon those who are baptized, and in 
danger of death. 

3. All who were here anointed by the Apostles were healed. 
But this is not the case in Extreme Unction, which has primary 
reference to the health and strength of the soul. 

4. Because the Council of Trent (Sess. 14) says that the Sacra 
ment of Extreme Unction was hinted at in S. Mark, but was 
commended and promulgated to the faithful by S. James, the 
Lord’s brother. This anointing, therefore, was a type, and as it 
were a prelude, of the institution of the Sacrament of Extreme 
Unction, not the sacrament itself. This, then, was a miraculous 
anointing, or a gift of miracles, bestowed upon the Apostles for a 
time, that they might by its means confirm their preaching of Christ 
It was not the sacrament itself. So S. Genoveva and many holy

anchorites were wont to heal the sick by means of oil blessed by 
them and sent to the sick. Victor of Antioch gives the reason 
why they used oil rather than wine, — “oil, amongst other things, 
assuages the affliction of labours, cherishes light, and promotes 
gladness.” Oil, therefore, which is used in the holy anointing, 
signifies the mercy of God, the healing of disease, and the 
enlightenment of the heart. In a similar way the baptism of 
John was not a sacrament, but a type and prelude of the Sacra- 
ment of Baptism. 

Ver. 1 6. Which Herod hearings said \ John whom I beheaded , he 
is risen again from the dead. It was as if he said, The soul of John 
has passed into Jesus, and so there, as it were, by rising again, 
has become more divine, and works such great and stupendous 
miracles. Luke (ix. 7) says that Herod doubted at first, but after- 
wards, on account of the universal fame of the miracles of Jesus, 
believed that John had risen again in Him. So S. Chrysostom, 
'Hieophylact, Augustine, and others. For the opinion of Pytha- 
goras concerning the metempsychosis or transmigration of souls 
was then very prevalent. S. Chrysostom says, “ How great a thing 
is virtue 1 for Herod fears even the dead man.” For, as Rabanus 
says, “ it is agreed by all that the saints shall have greater power 
when they rise again.” So also Bede. 

Ver. 17. For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John , and 
bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip 
his brother^ because he had married her. This Herod was not the 
Great, who was called Herod of Ascalon, who slew the infants of 
Bethlehem, but his son, sumamed Antipas, who arrayed Christ in 
a white robe and mocked Him. He it was who beheaded John 
the Baptist. 

You will say, Herod Antipas was only a tetrarch, for so Matthew 
calls him (xiv. 1). Why, then, does Mark here call him a king? I 
reply, he calls him king because he was the chief potentate in his 
tetrarchy, equal to a king in his kingdom. Wherefore he assumed 
the name of king, and it was given him by others, even by S. Mat- 
thew himself (xiv. 9).

In prison. Josephus adds that John was incarcerated in the 
fortress of Macher, on the confines of Galilee and Arabia, where 
he was beheaded. This prison was made famous by S. John, 
for the place, says Philo (lib. de Joseph.), was not so much a prison 
as a school of discipline. Seneca says (in Consolat. ad Albinam ), 
“When Socrates entered his prison, he was about to deprive the 
very place of ignominy, for that could not seem to be a prison 
where Socrates was.” Whence S. Cyprian (lib. 4, epist. 1, ad 
Martyr. ) says, “O blessed prison, which your presence has made 
illustrious: O darkness, brighter than the sun himself, where the 
temples of God have been!” The same (lib. 3, epist. 25) says 
concerning the chains of the martyrs, “They are ornaments, not 
bonds. They do not link the feet to infamy, but glorify them 
for the crown.” Wherefore S. Ambrose says (lib. de Joseph, c. 5), 
“Let not the innocent be distressed when they are the victims 
of false accusations. God visits His own, even in their prison. 
Then, therefore, is there the more help where is the greater peril. 
And what marvel is it if God visit those who are in prison, who 
speaks of Himself as shut up with His people in prison ? I was 
in prison, He says, and ye visited Me not” (Matt xxv. 44). 

On account of Herodias. This Herodias was the daughter of 
Aristobulus, Herod’s brother. Herod, then, had married her 
who was his niece, being his brother’s daughter. So Josephus. 
Herodias, therefore, was the sister of Herod Agrippa, who killed 
James, and who was himself slain by an angel (Acts xil). Where- 
fore Rufinus, and following him S. Jerome, Eusebius, and Bede, 
are in error, who say that she was a daughter of Aretas, a king of 
the Arabians. For they confound Herod’s first wife, who was the 
daughter of Aretas, with Herodias, his second wife. For Herod 
repudiated the daughter of Aretas to marry Herodias. For this 
reason Aretas made war upon him, and cut his army to pieces, as 
Josephus relates (lib. xviii. Antiq. c 7), adding, “It was an opinion 
among the Jews that Herod’s army was destroyed by the just ven- 
geance of God because of John the Baptist, a holy man, whom 
he had slain.”

His brothers wife. You will say that Josephus (lib. xviii. Ant 
c. 6, 7, 9) says that she was the wife of another Herod, who was 
the brother of Philip and Herod Antipas. I reply that Josephus 
is in error in this matter, as well as in many others ; unless you 
choose to suppose that Herodias was previously married to Herod 
Antipas. Josephus falls into another mistake in the same place, 
when he says that John was put to death not because of Herodias, 
but because Herod was afraid lest, on account of the concourse of 
the people to John, an insurrection might occur. 

Whether Herodias married Herod whilst her husband Philip 
was alive, or after his death, commentators are not agreed. But 
it is certain that either way it was an illicit marriage, and involved 
incest, to which was added adultery, if Philip were still alive. For 
by Leviticus (xviii. 16) it is forbidden for a brother to marry his 
brother's wife if there were offspring of the marriage, and Philip 
had left this dancing daughter, whom Josephus calls Salome. 
But I say that Herod did marry Herodias during his brothers 
lifetime, and against his will, and so committed a threefold sin, — 
the first, adultery; the second, incest; the third, violence. This 
is proved : 1st. Because Josephus expressly asserts it (lib. xviii. 
Ant. c. 7). 2nd. Because the incestuous marriage took place about 
the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar; for that was when John 
began to preach, as is plain from Luke iii. 1 ; but Philip died in 
the twentieth year of Tiberius, as Josephus affirms (xviii. 6), where 
he praises him for his justice and modesty. 3rd. Because the 
Fathers everywhere accuse Herod of adultery, because he took 
away his wife from his brother, who was of a meek disposition, 
whilst he was yet living. Thus Herod took advantage of his 
gentleness. 

Ver. 20. For Herod was afraid of John , knowing him to be a just 
man and a holy . At first, therefore, it was only Herodias who 
wished to kill John, as the rebuker of her adultery. Herod did 
not assent, as Mark here signifies, and Luke (ix.). But afterwards 
she persuaded Herod, which she did the more easily, because, as 
Josephus asserts, he was of a malignant disposition, and prone to

cruelty; and he was incensed against John on account of his 
frequent reproofs. “ Herodias was afraid,” says Bede, “lest 
Herod should some time or other come to a proper mind under 
John's rebuke, and dissolve the marriage, and restore Herodias to 
his brother Philip.” 

Ver. 22. And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come 
in , and danced^ and pleased Herod \ That female dancers were 
formerly introduced into their feasts by the Jews out of luxurious- 
ness appears from Josephus (lib. xii. Ant c. 4). That there was 
a similar fashion among the Greeks we learn from Xenophon’s 
Symposium , and from Lucian’s Dialogue de Saltatricibus , where 
he shows by many examples, and by the opinions of philoso- 
phers, that dancing enervates even a manly mind. Truly saith 
Ecclesiasticus (c. 9), “Use not much the company of a female 
dancer, nor listen to her, lest perchance thou perish through her 
influence.” Truly saith Remigius (on Matt, xiv.), “The shameless 
woman brought up a shameless daughter, teaching her to dance 
instead of to be modest Nor was Herod less to be blamed for 
allowing a woman to make a theatre of his palace-hall.” 

Ver. 25. I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish the head of 
fohn the Baptist. You will say, John the Baptist was not, then, a 
martyr, because Herod slew him not because of his faith, nor 
because of his rebuking him for his adultery, but for the sake of 
pleasing this dancing girl, and fulfilling his promise. I answer 
by denying the conclusion. For, 1st This girl asked the head of 
John at the instigation of her mother, who wished to cut off John 
for reproving her adultery. Herodias, therefore, was the virtual 
cause of John’s death, because she impelled Herod to behead 
him. 2nd. Herod assented to her. Knowing the malignant dis- 
position of his wife, he gave way to her, and killed John. 3rd. 
Herod himself desired to kill John, as Matthew says expressly 
(xiv. 5); but he did not dare to do it through fear of the people, 
who made great count of John as a holy man. Lastly, many are 
of opinion that probably all was done collusively and of set 

purpose — namely, that Herod had suggested to Herodias that

she should send her dancing daughter in to supper, and that she 
should ask for the head of John; that thus he might have from 
his promise a colourable pretext for killing him; and that this 
is the reason why Christ calls him a fox {Luc. xiii. 32). S. John, 
therefore, was a victim of chastity, because he died a martyr for 
it, like S. Paul, S. Matthew, S. Clement, and many others. 

Moreover, S. Gregory Nazianzen assigns a loftier cause for the 
early death of John from the hidden counsel of God (Ora/. 20). 
“ Who,” saith he, “was the precursor of Jesus? John, as a voice 
of speech, as a lantern of light ; before Whom also he leapt forth 
in strength, and was sent forward to Hades by Herod, that 
there likewise he might preach Him who was shortly to come.” 
The same Nazianzen (Ora/. 39) teaches that S. John, by the spirit 
of prophecy, was aware of this his martyrdom. For he says, “I 
ought, O Christ, to be baptized by Thee; yes, and for Thee.” 
For he had found out that he was to be baptized by martyrdom. 
For he knew what was to come ; that as after Herod Pilate would 
reign, so Christ would follow him after life was over. 

Ver. 26. The king was sorry , i.e., he pretended to be so, say 
SS. Hilary and Jerome. For he really wished John to be killed, 
as Matthew says. Wherefore the Gloss on the fourteenth of S. 
Matthew says, “Herod's sorrow was like Pilate's repentance” 
And the In/crlincar, “ The dissembler showed sorrow in his face, 
but was glad in his heart.” 

But more simply. S. Chrysostom and Euthymius think that 
Herod was really sorry is the meaning of SS. Matthew and Mark. 
For though he wished John to die, yet he was sorry for his cruel 
and shameful death, that he should have killed so great a prophet 
for the gratification of a dancing girl. 

For his oa/h's sake. Herod made a pretext of his oath ; for he 
knew that in such a case, that is, at such an iniquitous and 
sacrilegious a request of the girl, it was not binding. However, 
he thought it a king's part not to retract it before the nobles, 
according to the saying, The word of the king is the king. Thus 
this worldling acted. Whence S. Augustine says, “A girl dances,

and a mother rages, and there is rash swearing in the midst of the 
luxurious feast, and an impious fulfilment of what was sworn.” 
For, as S. Isidore says, faith ought to be broken in wicked 
promises; that is, an impious promise which is fulfilled by a 
crime. 

Ver. 27. But sending an executioner , that is, a hangman; for 
soldiers were executioners and attendants of the praetors, and were 
armed with javelins ( spicula ). Hence they were called spiculators 
(the word in the Vulgate translated executioner is spiculator ). 
Our Gretzer (lib. 1, de Cruce, c. 25) is of opinion, from Suidas, that 
hangmen (carnifices) were called speculatores (for the Greek has 
fVfxooXarafa, which is really a Latin word, and the same as 
speculator ), Gr. i*r*jgac, because it was their office to spy out the 
plans and movements of an enemy, to be around princes as their 
bodyguard, and to execute those whom they condemned. So 
also Franc. Lucas on this passage, Lipsius on Tacitus, and some 
others. These assert that Suetonius and Tacitus call a camifex , 
speculator. But they cite no passage in support of what they say. 
Neither have I been able to find any in which the word speculator 
is used for an executioner (, carnifex ), with the exception of this one 
in S. Mark. Spiculator, , then, becomes tfjrcxouAarwg in Greek. For 
the Greeks often change the vowel i into e, as the Italians also do. 

He commanded his head to be brought in a dish. Thus did the 
savage season his feast with this horrible spectacle of cruelty. 
Bede adds, he wished all his guests to be associated with him in 
his cruelty. Moreover, S. Gregory says (Moral, lib. 3, c. 4), u God 
afflicts His own with infirmities, because He knows how to reward 
them in the highest If God exposes to anguish those whom He 
loves, what are those about to suffer whom He rejects ? ” 

S. John, then, has many laurels — xst That of doctor; and ot

2nd. Bede, and from him Baronius (A. C. 33), Maldonatus, and 
Barradi think that John was slain about the time of the Passover 
in Christ’s thirty-third year. They support this view, because 
Matthew says (xiv. 13) that Christ departed into the wilderness 
when He heard of the death of John, and there fed the 5000, an 
event which happened about the time of the Passover (John vi. 4). 

3rd. And very probably, our Salianus ( Anna /. tom. 6, in fin . 
ad ann. Christi 32, num. 20) thinks that John suffered at the 
end of the thirty-second year of the life of Christ, probably in 
December. He proves this, because Nicephoros (Jib. 1, c. 19) 
says that John at his death was thirty-two years and a half old; 
that is, at the completion of Christ’s thirty-second year. For 
John was born on the 24th of June, and was just six months 
older than Christ, who was born on the 25th of December of the 
same year. He gives us a second reason^ because although 
Christ’s departing into the desert (Matt, xiv.) occurred about the 
time of the Passover, yet John’s death preceded it by some con- 
siderable time For Christ departed not so much on account of 
John’s death, as because the fame of His own miracles had so 
greatly increased that many thought John had risen again in Him. 
But this took place when some considerable time, comparatively 
speaking, had elapsed after John’s death. That is to say, John’s 
being put to death took place in December, and Christ’s retiring 
into the desert about the following March. And the intervening 
period must have been taken up by the miracles which Christ 
wrought after John’s death, and by the fame of them being so 
widely spread abroad as to lead Herod to suspect that John had 
risen again in Jesus. This led Jesus to retire into the desert lest 
Herod should kill Him also. 

Lastly, some think that John suffered on the 29th of August, 
because the Church keeps the Feast of the Decollation of S. John 
the Baptist on that day. Baronius, however, thinks that this day 
is kept in memory of the Invention of the head of S. John.

of this murder. Apostrophising Herod, the latter cries, “Behold 
his eyes, even in death the witnesses of thy cruelty! He turns 
them away from the sight of thy dainties. His eyes are closed, 
not so much by the constraint of death, as by horror at thy luxury. 
That lifeless golden mouth, whose sentence thou couldst not 
endure, is silent, and yet it is dreaded.” 

S. Jerome says that Herodias insulted the severed head, and 
punctured his most holy tongue with a needle; upon which the 
Father exclaims, “Do not boast thyself so much because thou 
hast done what scorpions and flies do. So did Fulvia to Cicero,' 
and Herodias to John, because they could not bear the truth ; 
they pierced the tongue that spoke the truth with a needle” (S. 
Jerome, Apolog. cont. Rufin. sub finem). 

Wherefore the just vengeance of God burned against all who 
were concerned in this crime. Herod was defeated by Aretas. 
Afterwards he was banished with Herodias to Lyons, and deprived 
of his tetrarchy and everything by Caligula, at the instigation of 
Agrippa, the brother of Herodias, as Josephus relates (xviii. 10). 
Moreover, the head of the dancing daughter was cut off by means 
of ice. Hear what Nicephorus says, “As she was journeying 
once in the winter-time, and a frozen river had to be crossed 
on foot, the ice broke beneath her, not without the providence 
of God. Straightway she sank down up to her neck. This made 
her dance and wriggle about with all the lower parts of her body, 
not on land, but in the water. Her wicked head was glazed with 
ice, and at length severed from her body by the sharp edges, not of 
iron, but of the frozen water. Thus in the very ice she displayed 
the dance of death, and furnished a spectacle to all who beheld it> 
which brought to mind what she had done.” Hear also L Dexter 
(in Chron. A . C. 34), “Herod Antipas, with Herodias his in- 
cestuous mistress, was banished first to Gaul, and afterwards to 
Ilerda in Spain. Herodias dancing upon the river Sicoris when it 
was frozen, fell through the ice, and perished miserably.”

Placed it in a tomb . S. Jerome says that the body of S. John 
was buried at Sebaste, the former Samaria, where also the prophets 
Elisha and Obadiah were buried. Moreover, S. John wrought so 
many miracles at Sebaste that Julian the Apostate ordered his 
body to be burnt, but the Christians secretly conveyed away his 
relics.

THE SUPERSTITIOUS WASHING OF THE PHARISEES. 407 


CHAPTER VII. 

Z The Pharisees find fault at the disciples for eating with unmashen hands. 
8 They break the commandment of God by the traditions of men. 14 Meat 
defileth not the man. 24 He healeth the Syrophenician woman's daughter of 
an unclean spirit , 31 and one that was deaf and stammered in his speech. 

Ver. 2. To eat with common , that is, with unwashen hands. 
Hands unwashed were called common, because unclean and pro- 
fane things were common to both Jews and Gentiles, to clean and 
unclean persons alike. 

Observe, the Apostles were not so boorish as not to wash their 
hands before dining or supping, which even husbandmen and 
artisans do before meals ; but they abstained from the ceremonial, 
or rather the superstitious washing of the Pharisees, which they 
scrupulously observed from the tradition of their ancestors. 

Ver. 3. Often washing : Syr. betilarth, Le., diligently or carefully ; 
Gr. zealously; Heb. caph el caph, i.e., hand to hand, 

namely, by constant rubbing, as they do who wish to cleanse 
defiled hands. 

Ver. 4. From the market Because in the market are all kinds, 
both of persons and things, clean and unclean, by coming in 
contact with which they feared they had incurred pollution, and so 
they thought they could not cleanse themselves from such con- 
tamination except by washing, not their hands only, but their 
whole body. Whence it follows : 

Unless they be baptized, i.e., unless they immerse and wash their 


Digitized by L^ooQle 



408 


S. MARK, C VII. 


whole body, as the Jews do frequently, even at the present time. 
For to be baptized is more than to wash the hands . Because, 
therefore, by conversing with and touching Gentiles in the market 
they were compelled to handle some things that were unclean, 
they washed themselves all over when they came home. 

Of pots: Gr. giftw, ie., of wine-drinking vessels. The Syriac 
has cenophororun , vessels in which wine is carried, Vatablus 
understands wooden vessels, which were turned and polished, or 
ornamented with carving. 

And beds: on which they reclined at table. 

Ver. 15. Make a man common (Vulg.), i.e., defile him, as some 
MSS. read. 

Ver. 19. Because it entereth not into his hearty i.e., into his soul, 
and cannot therefore defile it. But goeth into the belly , where 
the purer portion of the food, being separated, proceeds to the 
liver and heart ; but that which is impure and feculent into the 
draught, by its going forth, purging, i.e., leaving pure all meats. 
For in that it, the impure, goeth away, it cleanses and purifies the 
remainder of the food. 

Ver. 26. A Gentile: Gr. i.e., a Grecian woman, for 

where the Greeks bore sway, all Gentiles were called Greeks. 
Hence the expression in the first chapter of the Epistle to the 
Romans, “ The Jew first, and also the Greek,” i.e., the Gentile. 

A Syrophenician, i.e., belonging to that part of Phoenicia which 
looks towards Syria. 

Ver. 32. And dumb : Gr. /AoyiXaXiF, lg, speaking with difficulty 
or an impediment, stammering. For when he was healed by Christ 
he spake right, \.^., freely, as it is in the 35th verse. He was not, 
therefore, entirely dumb, as they are who are bom deaf. These 
are called in Greek 

Ver. 33. And spitting, He touched his tongue. Christ wrought 
harmoniously, as though by His healing saliva He would moisten 
and loosen the dumb mouth, which was bound through drought 

Now He spat not upon the mouth of the mute, but upon His 
own finger, and by means of His finger applied the saliva to the

HEALING OF THE STAMMERER. 


409 


mouth of the mute, as may be gathered from the Greek. This 
was required by propriety and decorum. Moreover, when Christ 
opened the ears and unloosed the tongue of the body, He opened 
also the ears and tongue of the soul, that they might listen to 
His inspiration, and believe that He was the Messiah, and that 
they might ask and obtain of Him pardon of their sins. 

Tropologically : Every one ought to seek the same thing, and 
say with the Psalmist, “ O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth 
shall show forth Thy praise” (Ps. li. 17). We ought to do the 
same as regards our ears, that we may be able to sing aloud with 
Isaiah (L 4), “ The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the 
learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to 
him that is weary: He wakeneth morning by morning, He 
wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.” Now this is done 
when He Himself with His own Finger , that is, the Holy Ghost 
(for He is “the Finger of God,” Exod. viii. 19), and the spittle of 
Heavenly Wisdom, which is He Himself proceeding forth from 
the mouth of the Most High, touches the tongue of the soul. 

Ver. 34. And looking up to heaven (because from thence come 
words to the dumb, hearing to the deaf, healing for all infirmities, 
says Bede), He groaned ; both because He sympathised with the 
misery of the deaf and dumb man, as because in groaning He 
prayed and obtained healing for him from God. 

Ephpheta , which is, Be thou opened, i,e., which so signifies. 
“Where,” says Bede, “the two natures of the one and the 
same Mediator between God and man are plainly set forth. 
For, looking up to heaven as man, He groaned, being about 
to pray to God; presently by a single word, as having the 
power of Divine Majesty, He healed.” For we all have eyes, but 
the blind have theirs shut and closed, which in the Syriac idiom 
are elegantly said to be opened when their shutters are unclosed, 
as Angel us Caninius says (in Nom. Heb . c. 10). Moreover, the 
Heb. patach signifies to open . From whence is the imperative 

passive, or Niphal ’ hippateach , by crasis hippatach , for which the 
Syrians use Ephpheta, be open.

Ver. 36. He charged them that they should tell no man. This 
was not properly a command, involving a fault if disobeyed, but 
merely a token of urbanity and modesty, that, indeed, He might 
signify He would not make a parade of His miracles, or by their 
means obtain the vain glory of men. Wherefore they did not 
commit sin who nevertheless divulged them. Wherefore it follows, 
the more He charged them , so much the more a great deal did they 
publish it. “ We are taught by this,” says Theophylact, “ that when 
we confer benefits we should not seek for applause therefrom ; 
but when we have received benefits we should praise our bene- 
factors, even though they are unwilling to be praised.” And S. 
Augustine says, “By His prohibition the Lord wished to teach 
us how very fervently they ought to preach to whom He has 
given a command to preach, when they who were commanded to 
be silent could not hold their peace.” 

Ver. 37. He hath done all things well: Gr. xaXS;, i.e., beautifully , 
becomingly , harmoniously. Christ did nothing which the Pharisees 
or such like fault-finders could justly blame. Again, the Heb. 
for well is hetcb, Le., beneficently , because He gave hearing to the 
deaf, speech to the dumb. Indeed, Christ's whole life was one 
continuous beneficence.

THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES. 


4 11 


CHAPTER VIII. 

I Christ feedeth the people miraculously: io refuses to give a sign to the 
Pharisees: 14 admonisheth his disciples to beware of the leaven of the 
Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod: 22 giveth a blind man his sight: 
27 acknowledged that he is the Christ , who should suffer and rise again : 
34 and exhorteth to patience in persecution for the profession of the gospel \ 

Ver. 15. Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven 
of Herod, \ The leaven is the doctrine of the Pharisees, by which 
they taught children to say to their parents corban, , as well as 
other things contrary to the law of God. The leaven of Herod is 
the doctrine of the Sadducees, for with them Christ had had His 
most recent controversy, as appears from Matt xvi. 1-12. For 
Herod, as well as many of the principal people at that time, 
were Sadducees (see fos . xviil c. 2). They denied the immor- 
tality of the soul, and lived as Atheists. So Herod lived in adul- 
tery, killed John, and committed many other crimes, having no 
fear of God For although he thought that John had risen again 
in Christ, yet that opinion did not arise out of faith, but was 
wrung out of him by fear. Others, with Origen and S. Jerome, 
understand by leaven the sect of the Herodians, who flattered 
Herod, saying that he was the Messiah. But that referred to 
Herod of Ascalon, not Herod Antipas, as I have shown on Matt 
xxii. 16. 

Ver. 23. And taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out 
of the town , i.e ., outside of Bethsaida, as is plain from ver. 22. 
He led him forth for the same reason that when He was about to

heal the deaf and dumb man He took him aside from the multi- 
tude. This was, ist. For the sake of prayer, that, being alone. 
He might collect His thoughts, and unite Himself wholly to God, 
and pray the more intently and collectedly, and. To fly from the 
applause of men, and teach us to do the same. 3rd. Because 
the citizens of Bethsaida were unworthy of the miracle of Christ ; 
for although they had seen Him work so many miracles, they 
would not believe in Him. 

And spitting upon his eyes . Fasting spittle does good to the 
purblind, but does not illuminate those who have actually lost their 
sight. The saliva, therefore, of Christ was not a natural but a 
supernatural remedy for blindness, being the instrument by which 
Christ’s Godhead wrought 

S. Hilarion imitated this miracle by which Christ gave sight to 
a blind man, as S. Jerome relates in his Life . “A blind woman 
was brought to B. Hilarion, who said that she had expended 
all her substance upon physicians. Hilarion said to her, If thou 
hadst given to the poor what thou hast thrown away upon physi- 
cians, Christ the true Physician would have healed thee.” 

Laid His hands , i.e., when He had placed His hands upon the 
eyes of the blind man, and again removed them. For that is 
improbable which the Scholiast in S. Chrysostom says, that this 
blind man saw people (ver. 24) when Christ’s hands were over 
his eyes. For this would have been a new and uncalled-for 
miracle. 

Ver. 24. And looking up , he said 9 1 see men as it were trees 9 
walking. As much as to say, I see something obscurely and 
confusedly; for I see men walking, but in such a way that I 
cannot distinguish whether they are men or trees. Just as it 
happens to ourselves, says Bede; when we see people at a great 
distance, we can only distinguish men from trees by their motion, 
because men walk, but trees do not. The word walking must be 
referred to men, not to trees, as is plain by the Greek. The word 
walking in the Latin text, however, might refer to trees in this 
sense : I see men as it were trees split, and therefore two-footed,

and so walking. This blind man, therefore, as yet in darkness, 
saw men as it were through a mist and cloud, in which they 
appeared greater than they really were, it might be as thick and 
tall as trees, as by means of magnifying glasses letters appear 
larger than they are in reality. 

It is related of S. Gregory Thaumaturgus, that in the Decian 
persecution he fled with his deacon to a certain hilL A certain 
traitor made known where they were to the persecutors, who 
carefully searched the whole hill to discover Gregory. With 
strong faith in God, he stood in prayer, with eyes immovable 
and hands stretched out But God smote the persecutors with 
inability to see. They returned and reported that they had seen 
nothing on the hill except two trees a little distant from one 
another. When they had gone away, the traitor himself went up 
the hill and saw two men, Gregory and his deacon, instead of the 
trees. He acknowledged that it was the work of Divine power 
that they had appeared to the persecutors to be trees, and he fell 
down at their feet, and from a traitor became a confessor of the 
faith. (S. Greg. Nyss. in Vita.) 

Mystically: The Scholiast in S. Jerome says, “The blind man 

4 

is a penitent sinner. He sees men as trees walking, because he 
esteems every one superior to himself. With David he counts 
himself unworthy to be called a man, deeming himself to be a 
dead dog and a flea” (2 Sam. xvi.). 

Ver. 25. After that again He laid His hands upon his eyes , and 
ke began to see , and was restored , so that he saw all things clearly . 
Christ wished not suddenly, but by degrees, perfectly to illuminate 
this blind man : 1st That He might exhibit miracles of every 
description. 2nd. That this miracle might be more esteemed. 
3rd. And principally, That He might accommodate Himself to the 
imperfect faith of the blind man and those who brought him, their 
faith increasing as the miracle proceeded ; and that He might the 
more kindle in them faith, hope, and desire that it might be brought 
to a perfect work. “ In the first place, He cured this blind man 
imperfectly,” says Euthymius, “inasmuch as he believed imper-

fectly, that he who as yet had but a little vision might by means 
of the little light believe more perfectly, and be healed more 
completely ; for He was the wise Physician.* And by and by he 
says, “ Increase of faith deserved increase of healing.” 

Tropologically ; Christ wished to teach us that the unbeliever 
and the sinner are gradually illuminated by God, and that they 
ought correspondingly to make gradual increase in the knowledge 
and worship of God. “He did it,” says Bede, “that He might 
show the greatness of human blindness, which is wont to arrive 
step by step, and by certain grades, as it were, of progression, at 
the light of the Divine knowledge.” For as the Scholiast says, 
“ There are degrees of knowledge ; neither can any one arrive in 
a single hour, or, indeed, without considerable time, at perfect 
knowledge.” We have experience of this in children and scholars, 
who must be taught and instructed step by step. For if the 
teacher, being impatient of delay and trouble, should wish to teach 
them everything at once, he would crush their memory and intellect, 
so that they would take in nothing. It is like wine when it is 
poured into a vessel with a narrow neck ; if you try to pour it all 
in at once, you pour in scarcely anything, but nearly the whole is 
spilled. Worthy of note is the Italian proverb, “Gently, gently, 
if you would go far;” or the saying of the philosopher, “Progres- 
sion is by degrees.” 

Symbolically: The Scholiast in S. Jerome says, “Christ laid His 
hands upon his eyes, that he might see all things clearly, that is, 
that by visible works he might understand things invisible, and 
which eye hath not seen ; and that after the film of sin he might 
clearly behold the state of his soul with the eye of a clean heart. 
For blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” 

Ver. 34. In this adulterous generation, of depraved Jews, who 
are sons of God, though not genuine ones, but like spurious 
children, the offspring of adultery. For they are degenerate from 
the faith of their fathers, the Patriarchs, since they will not receive

for such great benefits receive curses and ill-treatment from 
the ungrateful and the impious, and shall at last be killed by 
them. 

Ver. 15. And presently all the people seeing Jesus, were astonished, 
and struck with fear: and running to Him, they saluted Him. 
They were astonished because they saw Jesus so unexpectedly 
present after His absence, and at so opportune a time, to defend 
His disciples against the scribes. Again, it was because they saw 
in the face of Jesus, who had a little while before been trans- 
figured, some remaining rays of His splendour ; just as there were 
in the countenance of Moses, after his converse with God, rays, 
and, as it were, horns of light.

indignation and gnashing of teeth he thus grievously afflicted and 
tormented the energumen . 

Ver. 29. They passed through Galilee , and He would not tha* 
any vne should know it Lest He should be detained by the 
Galileans from love of Himself and His benefits. For He was 
hastening to Jerusalem to His cross and death, about which He 
was speaking privately to His disciples, that He might accomplish 
the will of His Father, and redeem the human race. 

Ver. 31. But they understood not the word. That is to say, in 
what manner, and for what cause, Christ was to die; and how 
these words concerning His near approaching death agreed with 
what He had often told them, that His kingdom was at hand. 
For otherwise the Apostles understood and believed that Christ 
would die (see Matt xvii. 23), when they are said to have been 
sorry at this saying of Christ concerning His death. Unless you 
prefer to say that they were ignorant of the death of Christ, 
because they were in hesitation with respect to it on account of 
the different sayings of Christ, apparently inconsistent with one 
another, and that accordingly they inclined to the view which was 
the more pleasing to them. For it was this which they wished 
to be true. “For so lovers frame dreams for themselves." So 
they endeavoured to persuade themselves that these words of 
Christ concerning His death had some other hidden meaning, 
and that they were not to be taken literally, but mystically. 

Ver. 37. John answered Him , sayings Master , we saw one cast- 
ing out devils in Thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade 
him. It is as though he said, “Have we done well or ill?" 
John asks this question not out of envy, as Calvin would have 
it, but out of love and zeal for the honour of Christ And it was 
occasioned by what He had said in the preceding verse, Whosoever 
shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me. As 
though he said, If he who receives a little one in Thy name 
receiveth Thy Father and Thyself, what must we think concerning 
him who works miracles in Thy name, and yet followeth not us, 
that is, is not Thy attendant and disciple, as we are ? “ Because,"

says Cyril (in Catena in Luc. xi. 49), “ the Saviour had given powei 
to His Apostles to cast out unclean spirits, they thought that it 
had been conceded to none others save themselves to enjoy such 
dignity/ So Theophylact and Victor. 

Here observe that those who thus cast out devils in the name 
of Christ, and yet did not follow Him, were believers, but im- 
perfect ones, forasmuch as they shrank from the rugged poverty 
and renunciation of their goods, such as was the lot of the 
Apostles. They shrank from following Christ in His evangelical 
labours and His persecutions. Still they have some faith in 
Christ, by virtue of which they cast out devils. So S. Ambrose 
(in Luc. xL 49). And in so doing Christ wrought and co-operated 
with them, that His power and glory might be the more made 
manifest, which wrought such great things by means of those who 
were so imperfect, and, as it were, aliens. 

Observe, in the next place, that the Apostles did not forbid 
such people through hatred, but out of zeal for Christ, as though 
they were detracting from the glory of Christ and His ordinance, 
according to chap. iiL 15, where Christ gives to His Apostles only 
the power of casting out devils. But this zeal of theirs was 
indiscreet, especially because they had rashly, without consulting 
Christ, forbidden them. And Christ showed them that this was 
so for a double reason. The first is what He brings forward in 
the next verse. In a similar manner, when Joshua saw Eldad and 
Medad prophesying, he wished to forbid them, as if they were 
detracting from the glory of Moses, in that they had not received 
the spirit of prophecy from Moses. But Moses checked him by 
saying, “Enviest thou for my sake? Would that all the people 
were prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon 
them ! * (Num. xL 29). This is the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of 
love and of the Holy Ghost, which makes large the heart, and 
envieth none, but rejoices in all good things, by whomsoever and 
in what way soever they are wrought (see 1 Cor. xiil). 

Ver. 38. But Jesus said \ Do not forbid him, for there is no man 
that doth a miracle in My name, and can soon (Gr. rdya, i.e.,

easily) speak ill of Me . Do not hinder him in a good work, and 
one that honours Me ; because even if he does not follow Me, yet 
he is doing the self same thing which you do, that is to say, he 
is celebrating My name, and he is making it known to men by 
casting out devils. Wherefore he does nothing that is against My 
name, but rather propagates and glorifies it 

Ver. 39. For he that is not against you is for you. This man, 
therefore, is not your adversary, in that he does the same that 
you do. He stands on your side. He helps you; he does not 
oppose you. 

Ver. 40. For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in 
My name , because you belong to Christ : Amen I say to you, he shall 
not lose his reward. This is Christ’s further reason to show why 
the man must not be forbidden to cast out devils. It is as though 
Christ said, “ If he who gives you a drink of water in My name, 
and for My sake, does well, and shall receive a reward from God, 
so likewise shall he who drives out devils in My name. For both 
the one and the other do a good work, and are profitable to their 
neighbours in regard and respect of Me. But the one confers so 
much the greater benefit than the other, by as much as the devil 
whom he drives out is more hurtful than the thirst which the other 
alleviates by a draught of water.” So Theophylact. 

Ver. 41. And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones 
that believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were 
hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. This is anti- 
thetical to the 36th verse. For Christ returns after the question 
interposed by John to what He had said concerning those who 
should receive a little child in His name. For as he who receives 
and cherishes the little ones who believe in Me, receives Myself 
and shall be rewarded by Me with eternal glory in heaven; so, 
on the other hand, whoso shall cause one of these little ones to 
offend, offendeth Me, and shall be by Me condemned to Gehenna. 

Ver. 42. And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off. For a 
scandal is so pernicious that it harms not only the doer but the 
sufferer of it Wherefore, if thou sufferest a scandal from thy

hand, cut it off. That is, if any one, relative or friend, as useful 
and as dear to thee as thy hand, thy foot, thine eye, scandalize 
thee, that is, draw thee into sin, separate such an one from thy 
company, lest he drag thee with him into Gehenna. 

Ver. 43. Where their worm dieth not He quotes Isa. Ixvi. 24. 
Christ repeats this saying three times, that He may impress these 
dreadful worms and these fires upon us, that through horror of 
them we may avoid every scandal and every sin. 

Ver. 48. For every one shall be salted with fire : and every victim 
shall be salted with salt 

1st Franc. Lucas and Maldonatus understand the fire of hell, 
that Christ gives the reason of what He had just said, where their 
worm, See. The reason is, for every one, namely, such as are 
adjudged to Gehenna, shall be salted with fire, that is, shall be 
burnt and tormented with fire, but in such manner that by the 
same fire, as it were by salt, they shall be preserved incorrupt for 
everlasting torments. For salt possesses the properties both of 
burning and preserving. It burns and torments by burning; by 
its saltness it preserves from corruption. The fire of hell does the 
same thing, wherefore it is appropriately compared to salt. 

And every victim: and, that is, like as. As though He said, 
“ As every victim of God is wont to be seasoned with salt, accord- 
ing to the Law (Lev. il 13), so whosoever shall be adjudged to 
Gehenna shall be a victim, as it were, of the justice and vengeance 
of God for ever, and so shall be salted with fire unquenchable 
as with salt, that is, shall be burnt and tormented, and shall at 
the same time remain unconsumed in the fire.” So Isaiah teaches 
that the wicked shall in their torments be victims of God’s 
vengeance (xxxiv. 6; see also Ezek. xxxix. 17, and Jer. xlvi. 10). 
For the wicked are, as it were, victims immolated to the honour 
of God’s justice. This sense is very plain, apposite, and in accord- 
ance with the context. 

2nd. Others refer the words more remotely to what Christ said 
in the 42nd and following verses about avoiding scandals, and 
that to do so a hand or a foot must be cut off. It would be as

though He said, “Cut off from thee the person who is as dear 
and as necessary to thee as a hand or an eye, if he scandalize 
thee ; for every one who seeks to please God, and to offer himself 
to Him as a spiritual victim, must cut off from him, as by the 
fire of mortification, the man who causes him to offend, however 
dear he may be. He must, therefore, be salted by suffering tribula- 
tion, that is, he must be crucified and purified. He must be salted 
with the mystical salt of prudence, discretion, and evangelical 
wisdom, which teaches us that it is better to cut off our hand than 
to go into hell” There is an allusion to, or, indeed, in a mystical 
sense, a citation of Lev. ii. 13, “ Whatsoever thou shalt offer in 
sacrifice, thou shalt season with salt.” So Theophylact on this 
passage of S. Mark; Theodoret, Procopius, Bede, Radulphus, 
Ruperti, on Lev. ii., and Cyril (lib. 15, de Adorat.). Wherefore 
it is added, salt is good. Hear the Gloss, “ To be salted with fire 
is for the love of Christ to deny ourselves of those who are nearest 
to us, and as dear as a hand or an eye.” Hear also Bede, “The 
heart of the elect is the altar, the victims are good works, the salt 
is wisdom.” Christ opposes the fire of mortification to the fire 
of hell, and the salt to the undying worm. As though He said, 
“That ye may escape the fire and the worm of hell, which con 
cupiscence generates, be zealous for the fire of mortification and 
the salt of wisdom. For this shall take away the putridity of 
concupiscence, from which are generated the undying worms which 
shall be burned in the fire of hell” 

3rd. By fire Bede understands charity and the Holy Spirit, 
and His gift of discretion, by which He guides us into all 
good. 

Lastly, the Scholiast in S. Jerome by salt understands also the 
fire of Purgatory. Hear what he says, “ The victim of the Lord 
is the human race, which in this life is seasoned with the season 
of wisdom, when the corruption of the blood, which is the source 
of putridity, that is, the mother of worms, is consumed, and after 
this life is tried by purgatorial fire.” 

Salt is good , Le., useful. “Ye, O ye Apostles, who have

422 


S. MARK, C. IX. 


been chosen by Me to be the salt of the earthy are profitable to 
the world, that ye may season with your wisdom and evangelical 
doctrine all nations.” Hear the Scholiast, “It is a good thing 
to hear the Word of God; to season the heart with the salt of 
wisdom ; yea, to be salt, like the Apostles, to minister wisdom 
unto others.” Also Theophylact, “Salt preserves flesh; so the 
speech of a doctor prevents the unquenchable fire from being 
generated in carnal men.” 

But if the salt become unsavoury (the Gr. contains an elegant 
pun, a\c Le., saltless salt), wherewith (i.e., with what 

other salt) will ye season it f It is as if He said, “ If ye, O ye 
Apostles, who are the salt of the earth, lose this virtue of 
saltness, and become unsavoury and insipid, that through love 
or fear of men, through cupidity or ambition, ye fall away from 
My doctrine and an evangelical life, who shall restore you to 
your former wisdom, vigour, and sanctity ? ” Christ plays upon the 
word salt. For salt in Lev. ii. 13 is to be understood literally, 
but here it is to be taken mystically for wisdom, and metony- 
mically for the Apostles, who had in themselves this mystic salt 
Hear the Scholiast in S. Jerome, “Salt is savourless which loves 
the chief place, and which dares not either to rebuke or confess, 
loving the praise of men more than the praise of God.” Christ 
has a reference to Judas, who being corrupted by the love of 
money, and becoming unsavoury, lost his Apostleship, and did not 
hesitate to betray the Lord. 

Have salt in yourselves , Le., the salt of wisdom and a Christian 
life, as humility, charity, contempt of the world, but especially peace; 
as Christ adds, saying, And have peace among yourselves . “ Do 

not ambitiously contend among yourselves for the primacy, as ye 
have contended” (ver. 33), to which Christ refers. For such a 
contention will be a scandal to the whole world; and for that 
reason Christ subjoined what is said concerning the avoidance 
of scandal in verses 36 and 41. But if ye preserve peace and 
mutual concord, ye shall be for the edification of the whole 
world ; and being united one with another in the bond of charity,

SALT. 


423 


ye will be invincible, and will draw all men to yourselves and 
Christ Therefore by peace the Interlinear understands love . 
And the Scholiast thus expounds, Have salt in yourselves , “ The 
love of one's neighbour tempers the salt of correction; and the 
salt of justice preserves love.” 

Have peace , &c. That is, let him who speaks eloquently 
greatly fear lest by his eloquence unity be broken. For, as 
Bede says, “ to have salt without peace is not a gift of virtue, 
but a proof of condemnation ; for the wiser any one is, the 
greater his sin if he fall” “For there are many,” says the Gloss, 
“that whilst greater knowledge lifts them up, it separates them 
from the society of others ; and the wiser they are, the more they 
fall from the virtue of concord.” 

Lastly, the Gloss thus expounds, Have salt in you , i.e. t have 
discretion : and have peace among yourselves . By wisdom and 
discretion peace is both acquired and preserved among men. 
For the prudent and discreet do nothing which may offend 
others and disturb peace. The same bear with the infirmities 
of others, while those who are impatient are angry, and strive 
with them.

S. MARK, C. X. 


CHAPTER X. 

2 Christ disputeth with the Pharisees touching divorcement : 13 hlesseth the 
children that are brought unto him : 17 resolveth a rich man how he may 
inherit life everlasting : 23 telleth his disciples of the danger of riches: 28 
promiseth rewards to them that forsake anything for the gospel: 32 fort- 
telleth his death and resurrection : 35 biddeth the two ambitious suitors to 
think rather of suffering with him : 46 and restoreth to Bartimaus his 
sight, 

Ver. 21. And Jesus regarding him, with a benignant and 
pleasant countenance, loved him , showed him marks of His 
love, taking his hand and smiling upon him, embracing and 
kissing him. 

One thing is wanting unto thee , namely, for the perfection of 
a holy and evangelical life. 

Follow Me, The Greek adds, Taking up thy cross . The Syriac 
has, Take thy cross , and come after Me, 

Ver. 24. Little children (Vulg.) ; the Syriac, My sons. By His 
bland address He softens the hardness of the matter. He is 
like one who loves his children most dearly; and as such He 
would tell them the truth in sincerity, and persuade them to 
renounce riches as a bar to salvation. 

That trust in riches. For rich men trust in their riches rather 
than in God, according to the saying in Proverbs (x. 15), “The 
substance of a rich man is the city of his strength” (Vulg.). 
With difficulty, therefore, are they saved, because salvation cometh 
only from God. Wherefore those who wish to be saved must 
put their trust in God, and must ask and wait for salvation from

THE HUNDREDFOLD REWARD.

Him, as the poor do. For inasmuch as they have no riches in 
which to trust, they are obliged to place all their hopes in God, 
according to the words (Ps. xiv. 6), a Ye have shamed the 
counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope.” Therefore 
if rich men wish to be saved, let them turn their hope, their 
heart, their love from riches, and fix them upon God. 

Ver. 30. Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now 
in this time; houses , and brethren, and sisters, and mothers , and 
children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come 
life everlasting. I have explained this hundredfold in S. Matt 
xix. 29. Mark here adds, with persecutions. The Arabic has, 
in tribulations. “Let him who has relinquished his possessions 
and friends for the love of Christ, and is set in the midst of 
persecutions, and is encompassed by them on every side, be 
faithful For there will not be wanting a hundred, that is, very 
many, who will succour and cherish him, as brothers, fathers, 
and mothers.” So Jerome, Bede, &c. 

This is added because in persecutions the believer especially 
needs the help and assistance of others. Also, because this is a 
rare and marvellous thing, that in persecution, when a man is 
wont to be left destitute of help and friends, and when all, 
through fear of danger, withdraw themselves from him, those who 
follow Christ experience the exact contrary, and find a hundred, 
i.e., very many to succour them. 

Again, with persecutions may be taken thus — that persecutions 
and tribulations undergone for Christ’s sake are part of the 
reward which shall be given, together with the hundredfold, to 
those who follow Christ. For to suffer for Christ is a great gift 
of God, as the Apostle teaches (Phil. ii. 19). 

Ver. 32. They were in the way, from Jericho, . . . and Jesus went 
before them, as with alacrity, affording Himself as a guide in the 
way to the frightened Apostles, who shrank from Jerusalem, because 
they knew that Jesus was there sought for by the princes to be 
put to death. Yea, a decree had been made to that effect by their 
great council, the Sanhedrim (John xi. 52). Whence it follows —

S. MARK, C. X. 


They were astonished, \ and followings were afraid Gr. 

0 ou*ro, Le., they were astonished with great fear and dread. The 
imminent peril of death, says Bede, was the cause of their fear. 
They were amazed that Christ with so prompt and resolute a 
mind should bring Himself and His disciples into such open 
peril of death. They were afraid lest they might suffer and be 
put to death with Christ 

Ver. 38. Or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am 
baptized. Christ calls His Passion a baptisms because He was 
to be evidently immersed and drowned in it, according to what 
David says of himself, but much more of Christ (Ps. Ixix. 12), 

“ Save me, O God ; for the waters are come in unto my soul. I 
sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into 
deep waters, where the floods overflow me.” 

Ver. 42. Ye know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles 
lord it over them. Gr. xaraxv^voven ahrw, Le:, dominate over 
them, or against them. For who seem, the Gr. is 0} doxeu>rcc, 
i.e., who please themselves , and rejoice in ruling. For none rule 
more imperiously and harshly than those who are delighted with 
ruling and commanding. Whence the Arabic translates, they who 
think themselves princes of the people are their lords, i.f., they exercise, 
as it were, a tyrannical domination over them. 

Ver. 46. Bartimceus, the son of Timceus. This blind man, then, 
was called by a proper name, Bartimceus, i.e., the son of Timaeus, 
as Bartholomew is the same as son of Ptolemy. The same was 
called also by the same name as his father Timaeus. Timaeus was 
the name of that Pythagorean philosopher who wrote the life of 
Pythagoras. 

Moreover, Bartimaeus is interpreted by Pagnini in three ways 
(in Nom. Hebraicis). The first is from S. Jerome, to the effect 
that Bart maeus means the blind son, or the son of blindness. He 
says that it is a Syriac name, but corrupted from Barsemia, or 
Barsamceus. Bar is son, sernaia, blindness. 

The second opinion is, that it means the son of honour; as if 
compounded of the Syriac bar, a son, and the Gr. rt^n, honour .

MEANING OF BAR-TIMASUS. 


427 


The third is, that it means the son of the admirer , or admirable 
com , or admirable purity . For this was what the blind man 
received from Christ. For being illuminated in body, he was far 
more illuminated in his soul For bar means mealy or wheats or 
purity , as well as son. Tamah is to admire . 

And followed Him in the way . Aforaliter: Says the Gloss, Let 
us consider the way in which He goeth, and follow Him by humility 
and labours. The way is that of which He saith, “I am the 
way, the truth, and the life.” This is “the narrow way,” which 
leads to the heights of Jerusalem and Bethany, to the Mount of 
Olives, which is the mount of light and consolation ; yea, which 
leads to Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem. The blind man there- 
fore sees and follows, for he who rightly understands the life of 
Christ ought to follow and imitate it by his works.

Ver. 10. Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh. 
It means, blessed by the benediction and goodness of God, i,e. % 
“let it be happy, propitious, flourishing, firm, and abounding in 
all good things, this kingdom of our father David, which is the 
kingdom of Israel — that kingdom which was most ample and 
flourishing under David and Solomon his son, and which fell to 
pieces at the Babylonian captivity, and subsequently. Now does 
that kingdom come. It returns, and is restored by this our 
Messiah, the Son of David, who shall restore it to its pristine 
glory and beauty, yea, who shall make it far more strong and 
flourishing.”

called Bethesda, or by corruption Bethsaida, to the upper city, 
or Solomon’s palace, the nearest way was through this porch or 
court of Solomon’s. For otherwise they would have to traverse

the whole exterior boundary of this court. It was not surprising, 
therefore, that servants and children, who were carrying any 
burden, should take the nearer way through this court. But 
Christ forbade their doing so, both by His word and the gestures 
which He made with His hand, and compelled them to go back. 
What, then, would He have done with respect to the Holy Place 
itself? What with respect to our churches? (See Vilalpandus,

S. MARK, C. XIL 


CHAPTER XIL 

X The parable of the vineyard. 13 Touching the paying of tribute. 18 The 
Sadducees confuted. 35 A difficulty proposed to the scribes . 

Ver. 1. Planted a vineyard. Gr. i<f>vrcvoc» t Vulg. pastinavit. 
The verb pastinare is especially used of vines. It means to dig 

the soil of the vineyard, and prepare it for planting vines. So the 
word repastinare means to dig up vines when they are sterile. 

And dug a lake (Vulg.), a receptacle into which the must 
pressed from the grapes might flow. The Gr. is fcroX^uo*, Le^ 
beneath the winepress. For Xfifii means winepress. Hence the 
Arabic translates, and dug a winepress in it. S. Matthew (xxi. 33) 
uses the same expression. For torcular , or winepress , means not 
only the actual press itself, but the vat or receptacle beneath the 
press in which the grape juice was received This last was said 
to be dug \ or, as in Isa v. 1, to be cut out. 

Ver. 33. And to lave onds neighbour as oneself is a greater 
thing than all holocausts and sacrifices. Holocausts were sacrifices 
in which the whole victim was burnt and sacrificed to God by 
fire. This is what God says, “ I will mercy and not sacrifice, 
and the knowledge of God more than holocausts” (Hosea vi 6)t 
This young man tacitly assents to the saying of Christ, and con- 
demns the scribes, who preferred sacrifices, which yielded profit 
to themselves, to mercy and the love of our neighbour. And this 
was why they bade children say to their parents, when they were 
in need, corban^ Le., oblation (see on Matt xv. 6).

SIMULATED HOLINESS. 


431 


Ver. 34. Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. Thou art 
not far from the way of salvation, for the love of God and our 
neighbour is the pathway to heaven. Again it means, thou art not 
far from My Churchy by which, militant here on earth, we go to 
the Church triumphant in heaven. “ Still, as yet thou lackest 
faith to believe in Me as the Messiah, the Saviour of the world, 
and to obey My commands, so that thou mayest indeed become a 
Christian. And if thou wilt be perfect, leave all things and follow 
Me, as the Apostles have done.” When, then, He says, thou art 
not far, “He shows,” says Victor of Antioch, “that he was still 
at some distance, and that he ought to reach forward to that 
which was before, and seek diligently for the things that were yet 
wanting unto him.” 

Ver. 38. Who love to walk in long robes, — stolis (Vulg.). The 
stola was an elegant garment, flowing down to the heels. Where- 
fore the Scribes wore it for the sake of ostentation. 

Ver. 40. Who devour, Gr. 0# xanaMofrse, i.e., who altogether 
consume and lick up the houses of widows , both by reason of the 
sumptuous feasts which they ask of them, as well as by the gifts 
and money which they avariciously extort from them under the 
pretext of offering prayers for them. “When, therefore,” says 
Bede, “the hand is stretched out to the poor, it is wont to help 
prayer; but those men passed whole nights in prayer that they 
might take from the poor.” 

These shall receive greater judgment \ A severer sentence of God, 
and a heavier condemnation shall press upon the Scribes in the 
day of judgment, because by a pretence of probity they are 
aiming at wrong-doing; and being clothed in the garments of 
God, they are fighting on the devil's side. “ Simulated holiness,” 
says S. Chrysostom, “ is a double iniquity.” 

Ver. 41. Haiv the people cast money: as, brass (Vulg), i.e., all sorts 
of money, whether brass, silver, or gold. For the first money was 
made of brass ; hence all money was afterwards called brass, even 
when made of silver or gold. 

Into the treasury ; gazophylacium (Vulg.). For gaza is a Persian

word, meaning riches ; and </>uXarre/> is to keep . This was a chest 
into which gifts were cast by the people, and kept for the service 
of the Temple, and for supporting the priests and the poor. 
Hence, also, the porch in which the chest was kept was called by 
the same name. Thus it is said in John viii. 20, “ These words 
spake Jesus in the treasury (gazophylacio ), teaching in the Temple." 
So Bede. 

Ver. 42. A certain poor widow cast in two mites , which make a 
farthing, . Not as if one mite made a farthing, as Euthymius under- 
stands, relying on Matt. v. 26. But two mites were equivalent to 
one farthing, as is here clearly expressed. For a farthing was the 
fourth part of a little ass ; and ten small asses made a denarius. A 
mite was half a farthing. 

Ver. 43. This poor widow hath cast in more than all. For 
although per se, and other things being equal, the greatest and best 
alms and oblations is that which is most, yet, per accidens, when 
other things are not equal, the greater alms is that which is offered 
with the greater devotion of charity and religion. For God does 
not so much regard the gift as the disposition of the giver. Again, 
the greater gift is not that which is of the greater value con- 
sidered in itself as that which is the greater and more difficult in 
respect of the giver. This widow, therefore, in giving a farthing, 
gave more than all, because she gave all that she had, although it 
was necessary for her life. And she would have given more if she 
had had more. For she trusted in God, that He in return would 
be more liberal to her, and provide for her necessity, according to 
the saying, “ Give God an egg, and receive a sheep.” Others truly 
gave of their abounding superfluities, as Christ here says. As 
Titus of Bostra says on Luke xxi. 3, “ With such magnanimity and 
devotion did she offer two mites, that is, all that she had, as if 
she counted her own life as nothing.” S. Paul gives the a priori 
reason (2 Cor. viii. 12), “If there be a ready mind, it is accepted 
according to what a man hath, not according to that which he hath 
not.” As Victor of Antioch says on this passage, “ For God does 
not so much consider the greatness of the gifts, as weigh the

THE TRUE ESTIMATION OF GIFTS. 433 

greatness and alacrity of the mind.” And Bede, “ He weighs not 
the substance, but the conscience of the offerers.” 

For, as S. Thomas says, inasmuch as the widow gave according 
to her ability, therefore it was the greater affection of charity which 
was valued in her. S. Ambrose thought the same (lib. 2, Offic. c. 
30), “The two mites of that widow surpassed the offerings of the 
rich, because she gave all she had ; but they offered only a small 
portion of their abundance.” Whence he infers, “ The disposition 
therefore makes the offering poor or valuable, and sets their true 
price upon things.”

THE ALABASTER BOX 


435 


CHAPTER XIV. 

I A conspiracy against Christ. 3 Precious ointment is poured on his head by a 
woman. 10 Judas selleth his Master for money. 12 Christ kimselj fore - 
telleth how he shall be betrayed of one of his disciples: 22 after the passover 
prepared and eaten , instituteth his supper : 26 declareth aforehand the fight 
of all his disciples , and Peter* s denial \ 43 Judas betrayeth him with a kiss. 

46 He is apprehended in the garden , 53 falsely accused \ and impiously con- 
demned of the Jews' council : 65 shamefully abused by them , 66 and thrice 
denied of Peter. 

Ver. 3. A woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious 
spikenard. “ Nardf says Pliny (/. 12, c. 12), “is a shrub which has 
a heavy and thick, but short, black, and easily broken root. It has 
a strong smell, like cypress, and a pungent taste. The leaf is small 
and thick, and the tops unfold into ears, so that spikenard is spoken 
of as being doubly endowed with both leaves and ears.” From 
the leaves of nard ointment is made — that which is called foliated ; 
but that made from the ears or spikes is called spikenard ; and 
this is superior to the foliated, because it has more substance and 
marrow, so to say. Instead of nardus spicatus (Vulg.), the Syriac 
has nardus capitalist i.e., chief, excellent, principal. As I have 
observed, the spikenard is superior to the foliated. The Greek has 
wrenxijc, which the Vulg. of S. John translates pistid. Pisticus is 
the same as spiked. Wherefore the Arabic trans., the best. 

Ver. 5. Three hundred pence. These were equivalent in value to 
thirty Roman aurei. So that for the thirty gold pieces which the 
miserable Judas accounted as lost in the anointing of Christ, he 
received thirty silver pieces for betraying Him.

Judas, but also because He was beginning to be hated by His own 
disciples.” 

Ver. 13. There shall meet you, “Observe the majesty of His

Ver. 14. Where is My refectory f That is, the place where I 
may refresh Myself with My disciples, and partake of the lamb. 
The Greek is xaraXu/ta, or inn ; the Syriac, place of dwelling ; Arabic, 
place in which I may eat the Passover, 

Furnished: provided with tables, couches, or beds and tapestry, 
decorated also with leaves and flowers, and all other requisites for 
celebrating the Passover. The Greek, Syriac, and Arabic add, 
Iroifiof, Le., prepared. For God had put it into the heart of the 
master of the house to prepare the supper-room for the sake of 
Christ, that He might find a place well adorned for the celebration 
of the Passover, that as soon as evening came there might be no 
delay, but that the lamb might be roasted and eaten, and all the 
other things accomplished which were to be done by Christ 

Ver. 23. Giving thanks : the Syriac adds, He blessed. 

And they all drank of it, namely, after Christ had consecrated 
the chalice, saying, This is My blood, as it follows. There is, 
therefore, a prolepsis, or anticipation, which Mark makes use of to 
show that the disciples fulfilled the command of Christ Drink 
ye all of it, as Matthew has, xxvi. 28.

Abba Abi , i.e., Father , My Father. The Arabic has O Father.

as Mark has it, namely, £/?/?& 6 Tarfy. For so the Apostle speaks, 
“In whom we cry, Abba Father” (Rom. viii. 15, Vulg.). “We 
must think,” says S. Augustine, “ that the Lord said ‘Abba Father' 
to intimate the mystery of His Church, which was to be gathered 
out of Jews and Gentiles.” And the Scholiast in S. Jerome says, 
“ He speaks in Hebrew and Greek, because there is no distinction 
between Jew and Greek.” 

Ver. 38. The spirit indeed is wiUing : Syriac, willing and 
prompt. 

Ver. 41. The hour is come : Arabic, the end, , i.e., of life, is present , 
and the hour is come. 

Ver. 44. Lead Him away carefully: Gr. i.e., securely , 

safely. Arab. Fear ye concerning Him; lest, that is, He glide away 
out of your hands, as He has done upon other occasions. 

Ver. 47. One of them, namely, Peter. “ Mark does not mention 
Peter's name,” says Theophylact, “ that he may not seem to praise 
his teacher, Peter, for his greater zeal for Christ.” 

Ver. 51. And a certain young man followed him having a linen 
doth cast round about his naked body ; and they laid hold on him. 
That is, he was clothed (amictus, Vulg.) with a linen vest over his 
naked body. It is plain, from the word amictus , that this piece of 
linen was a kind of linen garment, fitting the body, but so that it 
might easily be put on and off the back. This is also clear from 
Pollux, who calls the linen cloth « yfloXaw, Le., a veil, a cloak, 
a covering. 

You will ask who this young man was : ist S. Epiphanius (Hares. 
78) and S. Jerome, or whoever the author is on Ps. xxxviii., think 
that he was James the Lord’s brother. 

2nd. Bede and S. Chrysostom, S. Ambrose, S. Gregory, and 
Baronius think it was S. John; for he was a youth, and the 
youngest of the Apostles. But that it was neither John nor James, 
nor any of the Apostles, is plain from this, that Mark has just

before said, ver. 50, then all His disciples , meaning Apostles, forsook 
Him and fled. 

3rd Theophylact and Euthymius think that the young man was 
some one from the house of John Mark, in which Christ had eaten 
the Passover. 

4th. And more probably, Cajetan (in fentaculis) and others 
conjecture that this young man was a member or servant of a 
house adjacent to the garden, who, being awoke by the noise 
made by those who were apprehending Christ as they passed by, 
rose up from his bed, and ran to see what was being done. That 
he was a favourer or disciple of Christ appears from what Mark 
says, he followed Him . Wherefore also the officers laid hold of him, 
i.e., they wished to hold him by seizing his garment The Hebrew 
active verbs often signify commencement and effort 

Ver. 52. But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked. 
“As Joseph,” says the Scholiast, “left his garment in the hand of 
his immodest mistress, and fled from her naked.” 

Mark adds this incident in order to make it plain from this hasty 
flight of the young man how great was the trepidation about Christ, 
and how intense was the hatred and fury of the Jews against Christ, 
who even tried to seize a stranger who was following Him. Hence 
it is evident that far more would they have seized the Apostles, if 
they had not immediately fled away. 

Ver. 68. And the cock crew . Hear S. Chrysostom on S. Matt 
xxvl 70, “ Mark signifies that neither by the crow of the cock was 
he led to remember, nor did it keep him from denial.” Chrysostom 
adds, “ Mark only has written thus, most accurately detailing the 
gracious care of the Master for His disciple, and Peter's weakness. 
Wherefore we ought especially to admire him, because he not 
only did not hide his master’s fault, but wrote the account of it in 
greater detail than the others, for this very reason that he was 
Peter’s disciple.” 

Ver. 70. For thou art also a Galilaan. That is, by speaking in 
the idiom of the Galilseans thou showest thyself to be a Galilaean 
The Arabic adds, And thy speech is similar to their speech.

Ver. 72. And he began to weep: Gr. ?#cX«jc, i.e,, 

literally, adding he was weeping ; which you may translate, 1st, he 
began to weep; 2nd, he added to weep , i.e., “he began to weep very 
violently,” says Theophylact. The Arabic is, and he betook himself 
to tears, not in the court before the Jews, that he might not betray 
himself to them, but when he was alone, having gone out of it as 
appears from S. Matt. xxvi. 75.

& MARK, C. XV. 


CHAPTER XV. 

I Jesus brought bound, and accused before Pilate \ 15 Upon the clamour of the 

common people , the murderer Barabbas is loosed , and Jesus delivered up to be 
crucified. 17 He is crowned with thorns , 19 spit on , and mocked : 21 
fainteth in bearing his cross : 27 hangeth between two thieves : 29 suffereth 
the triumphing reproaches of the Jews : 39 but confessed by the centurion to 
be the Son of God : 43 and is honourably buried by Joseph. 

Ver. 25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. The 
third \ not beginning, but ending, and going on to the sixth. For 
that Christ was crucified at the sixth hour, or midday , appears from 
the 33rd verse. Some suspect that there is an error, and that the 
sixth ought to be read for the third. For the Hebrews had divided 
the day and also the night into four parts or hours, each of which 
contained three of our hours. The first began at sunrise, and 
lasted for three hours. When they were over, Terce began, and 
lasted for three hours, or until midday, when Sect began, and 
ended three hours afterwards, when None began, and lasted till 
Vespers, or evening. When Sect was beginning, or the sixth hour, 
Christ was crucified; and when None, or the ninth hour, was 
beginning, He died. 

Ver. 28. And with the uncked he was reputed: Heb. * 1303 , 
nimma , i.e., was numbered, was counted. See what I have said on 
Isa. liii. 12. The reason is, because Christ took to Himself our 
place, our account and reckoning. But we were wicked. He 
therefore was reckoned with the wicked, that He might make us, 
instead of wicked, just, righteous, and holy.

Hence it was called the Pro- Sabbath, />., the day before, or the

S. MARK, C. XVL 


CHAPTER XVI. 

t An angel declaretk the resurrection of Christ to thru women . 9 Christ him- 

self appeareth to Mary Magdalene: 12 to two going into the country: 14 
then to the apostles , 15 whom he sendeth forth to preach the gospel : 19 and 
ascendeth into heaven. 

Ver. 1. And when the Sabbath was past : that is to say, at the 
beginning of the night before the Lord’s day. “ After a sad week 
comes the radiance of a happy day,” says the Scholiast 

Mary of Jacob (Vulg.), i.e., Mary, the mother of James the Less 
and Jude, as the Arabic version gives it, and the wife of Cleopas. 

And Salome: the wife of Zebedee, and mother of James and 
John. 

That coming they might anoint Jesus. According to the custom 
of the Jews, says Theophylact ; that the body might be preserved 
sweet. Spices are of a drying nature. They did not realise the 
dignity of Christ’s Divinity, nor His resurrection. But they loved 
Him very tenderly, both as a man and a prophet, although now 
dead. 

Ver. 6 . Who was crucified: He is risen; He is not here. “The 
angel is not ashamed of the cross,” says Theophylact, “ for in it is 
the salvation of men.” The Interlinear says, “The cross’s bitter 
root is gone ; the flower of life with its fruits, which lay in death, 
has arisen in glory.” 

Go, tell His disciples. “The women are bid,” says the Inter - 
linear, “to announce it to the Apostles, because as by a woman 
(Eve) death was announced, by a woman it might be told that life 
had risen again.”

THE RESURRECTION.

And Peter. “ That him whom a woman had made deny, a woman 
might make confess,” says Druthmar. The Scholiast in S. Jerome 
adds that “ Peter was named especially because he counted him- 
self unworthy of being a disciple, because he had thrice denied 
his Master.” And S. Gregory {Horn. 21, in Evang.) says, “If 
the angel had not named Peter, he would not have dared to come 
among the disciples. He is called, therefore, by name, that he 
might not despair.” 

Ver. 8 . For a trembling (of body) and fear (of mind) had 
seized them. Theophylact says, “ ?x<rra<r/$, that is, stupor, at 
the sight of the angel had come on them.” But this astonish- 
ment was mingled with intense joy. For they were astounded 
and were glad at the wonderful things which they heard, even 
that Jesus their beloved was risen from the dead. 

For they were afraid. Not only because of the vision of 
angels, but also “ on account of the Jews,” says Euthymius, “ lest 
they should appear to have themselves stolen away Jesus; lest 
they should kill them when they heard that they had proclaimed 
the resurrection of Jesus: as shortly afterwards the Jews placed 
Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Lazarus in a ship without oars 
or sail, and sent them to what would have been certain destruction 
had not God brought them in safety to Marseilles.” 

Ver. 9. Magdalene , out of whom He had cast seven devils . 
Mark adds this to show the power of repentance and love. 
With these was Magdalene the sinner so inflamed, that she 
deserved first to see Christ risen again, that from her sinners 
might learn not to despair, but vehemently to love; for so they 
shall surpass the Holy Innocents in grace and glory. So Bede, 
“Because where sin abounded, grace hath superabounded. ” 
Bede adds, “A woman was the beginner of transgression. A 
woman first tasted death, but in Magdalene woman first saw the 
resurrection, that woman might not bear the perpetual guilt of 
transgression among men.” See what is said on Luke viii. 2.

the village ; Gr. into the field, i.e., to a country-house at Emmaus. 
For, as S. Austin says (Consens. Evang .), “under the name of 
country not only villages, but towns and boroughs outside the 
capital, which was the mother city of all, were wont to be 
called.” These disciples, therefore, were going from Jerusalem 
into the country, that is, into the neighbouring small town of 
Emmaus. This place was made a famous city by the Romans, 
and called Nicopolis, as a monument of their victory in the 
capture of Jerusalem. This appearance of Christ is the same as 
that related by S. Luke (xxiv. 13), as is plain from the circum- 
stances, which are the same in both cases. So commentators 
generally. Euthymius alone thinks they were different, because 
Mark adds that the Apostles did not believe them when they 
told them that Christ was risen, whilst Luke intimates the con- 
trary, that they did believe. But the answer is easy, that some 
believed, but others did not believe. 

Ver. 13. Neither did they believe them . This happened by the 
permission and providence of God. “For this their incredulity 
w^s not so much their weakness as it was to become our 
strength,” says S. Gregory. “For the resurrection itself was 
made manifest to them by many proofs, when they doubted of 
it And when we read and acknowledge these things, what else 
is it but to be confirmed by their doubting ? ” 

Ver. 14. At length He appeared to the eleven as they were at 
table, . The Vulgate has novissime , last of all: Gr. Dorcpo*. 

This was the last appearance of Christ on the day of the 
resurrection, for S. Mark only relates those appearances which 
took place on that day. You may say, But if so, He did not 
appear to the Eleven, but to the Apostles, for S. Thomas was 
absent Wherefore Maldonatus thinks that this appearance was 
that which took place on the Sunday after the resurrection, 
when Thomas was present But I say that they are here called 
the Eleven, although Thomas was absent, because the college of 
the Apostles after the treachery of Judas was reduced to eleven. 
That is why they are here called the Eleven, although Thomas

was absent Thus the Decemvirs were called by that name 
when gathered together, although one or two might be 
absent 

They did not believe. S. Jerome (lib. a, coni. Pelag.) writes 
that in some Greek codices there is found added after these words 
as follows: “And they had content, saying, Substance is that 
world of iniquity which by means of evil spirits suffers not the 
true power of God to be apprehended : therefore now reveal 
Thy righteousness.” But the Church has expunged all this, for 
it savours of the heresy of Manes and Montanus. 

Ver. 15. And He said unto them , Go ye into the whole worlds and 
preach the Gospel to every creature. He said this not on Easter 
day, when He appeared to the Eleven as they sat at meat, but 
afterwards, when He showed Himself to them and others on a 
mountain of Galilee, as it is in S. Matt, xxviii. 16, &c. Or it 
may be that He committed this chief and peculiar office of preach- 
ing the Gospel to the Apostles more than once. 

Go ye into the whole world , that is to say, not into Judaea 
only, as ye have done hitherto, but up and down in all directions 
throughout the world. For it does not seem probable that a 
few Apostles should have traversed and converted the whole world, 
especially because in America, lately discovered, no traces of the 
faith of Christ have been found. 

Every creature , i.e., to all nations, as it is in Matt xxviii. 19. 

Ver. 16. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but 
he that believeth not shall be condemned. This saying of Christ is 
abused to support their heresies, 1st, by the Lutherans, to prove 
that faith alone without good works is sufficient to salvation. 
But I reply that the meaning of Christ, as Euthymius, Theo- 
phylact, and others have observed, is, he that believeth , &c., i.e. y 
“he that, believing in Christ and receiving His baptism, has 
been washed from his sins, imbued with the grace of God, and 
sanctified, he shall be saved,” understand, “if he die in that 
state, retaining the grace of God even unto death.” But it is 
impossible for the baptized to continue in this state of grace if

they do not those good works which the law of Christ commands. 
Also, in the name of faith, or faith and baptism, , as the prime 
requisites, and which at the beginning of the Church were 

chiefly to be inculcated upon the Gentiles, all other things con- 
sequent upon them must be understood, such as hope, charity, 
and good works, as I have shown at length in the introduction 
to S. Paul’s Epistles. 

2nd. The Anabaptists infer from this saying of Christ that 

little children must not be baptized, because they cannot believe. 
But I answer, Christ is here speaking of adults. For only 

adults are able to believe, and all the preceding words apply to 
adults only. That little children ought to be baptized is plain 
from the perpetual tradition and practice of the Church, and 
from the words in S. John iii. 5, “ Verily, verily, I say unto you, 
unless any one be bom of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot 
enter into the kingdom of God.” 

S. Augustine adds, and reiterates in various passages, that 

these words of Christ do refer to infants also in a measure, 
for as they sinned by the will of Adam, not their own, so 
likewise they believe by the faith of the Church, in their 
parents, or those who present them for baptism, not by their 
own. 

3rd. The Calvinists gather from these words of Christ that 
baptism is not necessary for salvation, but that faith only is 
sufficient, because of it alone, they say, Christ subjoins, But he 
that believeth not shall be condemned \ I reply that under the 

word believe , i.e., faith, baptism must be understood, which is 
the sacrament of faith, as well as all the other things which 
spring from and follow faith, as I have just said. For Mark, 
studying brevity, left it to the reader to gather from what he 
had said immediately previous, that these must be understood, 
or shall not be baptized \ For otherwise the antithesis would be 
imperfect. To complete it we must read as follows, He that 
believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not, 
or is not baptized, shall be condemned For that baptism is necessary

MIRACLES IN THE EARLY CHURCH. 447 

for salvation is plain from the words of Christ in S. John iii. 5, 
already cited. 

Ver. 28. They shall take up serpents . From the places which 
they infested, and as Euthymius says, “ They shall destroy 
them, or even take them up in their hands without harm,” as S. 
Paul did the viper. Therefore the Arabic translates, They shall 
take up serpents in their hands . 

And if they shall drink any deadly thing. They shall 
drink poison unharmed, as the Apostles and many Saints have 
done. 

They shall lay their hands upon the sick , &c. Observe that 
these signs were necessary in the Primitive Church for proving 
and strengthening the faith of Christ. Wherefore at that time 
almost all believers wrought miracles, at least of certain kinds; 
as, for example, the expulsion of devils from energumens. This 
is plain from Justin’s Dialogue against Trypho y Tertullian 
( Apolog.) y Lactantius, and others. Many also at that time 

received in baptism the gift of tongues. See Acts x. 

47, &c. 

Mystically: S. Bernard (Serm. de Ascens.) says, “The first 
work of faith which worketh by love is compunction of heart, 
by which, without doubt, devils are cast out when sins are 
rooted out of the heart After that they who believe in Christ 
speak with new tongues when old things depart out of their 
mouth, and for the time to come they speak not with the old 
tongue of our first parents, who declined unto words of wicked- 
ness in making excuses for their sins. But when by compunction 
of the heart, and confession of the mouth, the former sins have 
been blotted out, in order that men may not backslide, and 
their latter end be worse than the beginning, it is needful that 
they take away serpents, that is, extinguish poisonous suggestions, 
&c. If they shall drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt 
them . This is, when they feel the stings of concupiscence, 
they shall not consent They shall lay their hands upon the 
sick , and they shall recover . This is, they shall cover their evil
