## Latin Originals (OT + Full Bible)

The entire OT commentary exists only in the original Latin. Lapide wrote commentaries on **every book of the Bible** (the only Jesuit to do so).

## OCR Text Access

Each Archive.org item has a `_djvu.txt` file with full OCR text:
```
https://archive.org/download/{IDENTIFIER}/{IDENTIFIER}_djvu.txt
```

The 1908 V1–V8 series uses Google Books OCR (older, decent quality).
The Viva Cristo Rey collection uses Tesseract 5.3 (2024, better quality).

## TSV Parsing Challenges

The OCR text is continuous prose commentary, NOT structured verse-by-verse data. Each chapter begins with the full biblical text (in KJV translation), followed by verse-by-verse commentary. The commentary references verses with patterns like:
- "Ver. 1.—" or "Verse 1."
- "CHAP. XXII." for chapter headers
- Interspersed Latin phrases

The scraper (`scrape-lapide.py`) handles parsing this semi-structured OCR text into `BookAbbrev\tChapter:Verse\tCommentary` format.

## Current Parsing Status (Feb 2026)

First run produced **2,377 verse commentaries** in `lapide.tsv` (6MB):

| Book | Verses Parsed | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Mt | 77 | V1-V2 use prose format without "Ver. N" markers — needs NLP alignment |
| Mk | 325 | Good coverage from V3 |
| Lk | 515 | Excellent coverage from V4 |
| Jn | 668 | Excellent coverage from V5-V6 |
| 1Jn | 90 | Good coverage from V6 |
| 1Cor | 353 | Good but some chapter-bleed artifacts in ch. 16 |
| 2Cor | 221 | Good coverage |
| Gal | 128 | Good coverage |

### Known Issues
1. **Matthew (V1-V2)** uses continuous prose without "Ver. N" markers for most chapters. Would need verse text alignment (matching DRB text to commentary prose) for full coverage.
2. **Chapter bleed**: Some verse numbers exceed actual chapter lengths when a chapter header is missed by OCR.
3. **OCR artifacts**: Latin phrases, Greek text, and special characters are sometimes mangled.
4. **2Jn/3Jn**: Very short epistles — may not have separate "Ver." markers.

### Improvement Ideas
- Use the DRB text to do fuzzy matching of quoted biblical text in the commentary
- Use the Viva Cristo Rey collection (better OCR quality) for Luke and John
- Manual review of chapter boundaries to fix bleed-through
