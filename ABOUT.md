# About the Douay-Rheims Bible

The Douay-Rheims Bible is an English translation of the Latin Vulgate, completed in two stages by English Catholic scholars in exile: the New Testament at Rheims in 1582 and the Old Testament at Douay in 1609-1610. It holds particular significance for traditional Catholics as the first complete Catholic Bible in English, officially authorized by the Church and based on St. Jerome's fourth-century Vulgate—the translation declared authentic by the Council of Trent. For centuries, it served as the standard English Bible for Catholics, shaping Catholic spirituality, liturgy, and theological expression in the English-speaking world until the mid-20th century. Traditional Catholics continue to revere it for its doctrinal accuracy, inclusion of the deuterocanonical books, distinctive theological vocabulary (such as "do penance" rather than "repent"), extensive annotations defending Catholic teaching, and its role as the basis for countless prayers, catechisms, and devotional works that remain central to traditional Catholic practice.
